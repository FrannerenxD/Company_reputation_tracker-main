Archive Magazine Save this story Save Save this story Save The wealthiest man in the world, Elon Musk , celebrated on his social media site X late Friday, writing that the \u201cpronoun bs is finally going away.\u201d \u201cThat was silly,\u201d Musk, who heads up the Department of Government Efficiency and has been slashing crucial federal funding for months, wrote after reposting a pronoun knock-knock joke. \u201cThank god Trump won,\u201d a user named TheDogeGlory replied below Musk\u2019s post, to which he responded with a bullseye emoji. Musk\u2019s post comes days after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that administration officials would refrain from responding to inquiries from journalists who include their preferred pronouns in email signatures or bios. \u201cAs a matter of policy,\u201d Leavitt wrote in an email from a reporter asking about the closure of a research observatory , \u201cwe do not respond to reporters with pronouns in their bios.\u201d SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk arrives on stage at an America PAC town hall on October 26, 2024 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Samuel Corum/Getty Images President Donald Trump \u2019s administration, in January, instructed federal employees to remove any reference to their identifying pronouns from their email signatures and other forms as a part of the broad effort to roll back any and all evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Or, as a Texas state employee found out , get fired. Leavitt\u2019s admission this week confirms that the press office is following suit. \u201cAny reporter who chooses to put their preferred pronouns in their bio clearly does not care about biological reality or truth and therefore cannot be trusted to write an honest story,\u201d the press secretary, who in just a few short months since Trump has taken office has gained a reputation as combative toward both individual journalists and legacy media in general, said in a separate statement to other news outlets. Axios also confirmed on Wednesday that officials will continue to skirt these reporters, asking Trump spokesperson Harrison Fields if that was now their official policy. \u201cFACTS!\u201d he replied. As The New York Times reported this week, \u201cOn at least three recent occasions, senior Trump press aides have refused to engage with reporters\u2019 questions because the journalists listed identifying pronouns in their email signatures.\u201d A spokesperson for the Times said, \u201cEvading tough questions certainly runs counter to transparent engagement with free and independent press reporting.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d they continued, \u201crefusing to answer a straightforward request to explain the administration\u2019s policies because of the formatting of an email signature is both a concerning and baffling choice, especially from the highest press office in the U.S. government.\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks during the daily briefing in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 25, 2025. JIM WATSON/Getty Images In one instance, Matt Berg , a reporter at Crooked Media, the network that runs the \u201cPod Save America\u201d family of podcasts, decided to experiment with the new administration\u2019s handling of journalists who include their pronouns. Berg doesn\u2019t usually include pronouns in his email signature. But, when he included \u201che/him\u201d in an email to Katie Miller , a senior adviser at DOGE, he too was met with a response claiming that the use of pronouns is detrimental to science, that it was her policy to refuse to respond to journalists with listed pronouns, and that he was ignoring facts. \u201cI find it baffling that they care more about pronouns than giving journalists accurate information, but here we are,\u201d Berg said in an email to the Times . The press office has previously been harsh on reporters who do not use the language they prefer. In February, Leavitt and the administration blocked The Associated Press from covering multiple White House events because it refused to change its editorial style from \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d to \u201cGulf of America.\u201d The AP sued Leavitt and two other White House officials on First Amendment grounds and won\u2014though the White House said it would be appealing. Dozens of protesters gather in Times Square near a military recruitment center to show their anger at President Donald Trump's decision to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals from serving in the military on July 26, 2017 in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images The White House\u2019s handling of pronouns aligns with the president\u2019s coordinated rollback of protections for transgender and nonbinary Americans and those who support them. Trump has signed several executive orders targeting transgender people. In his first moments in office, the president signed an order declaring that the United States would only recognize two sexes, \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale,\u201d as defined at conception\u2014a move that required government agencies to use an outdated and scientifically inaccurate gender binary on documents like passports, visas, and employee records. He also signed others aimed at barring transgender student athletes from playing on girls\u2019 sports teams, restricting funding for gender-affirming care for people under 19, and removing transgender service members from the military. Multiple of Trump\u2019s orders against transgender people are being challenged in the courts. For Musk, this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s discussed preferred pronouns on X, formerly Twitter. In 2022, he wrote , \u201cMy pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.\u201d And in June of 2023, on the first day of Pride Month, Musk said he would allow users to intentionally misgender someone without consequence. He also claimed that he personally would use the pronouns that someone prefers for manners\u2019 sake\u2014something he has repeatedly chosen not to do with his own daughter .

Agencies Confidential internal documents leaked following a cyberattack on NetJets, the private aviation firm owned by Berkshire Hathaway. They have reportedly exposed a detailed in-flight service guide tailored exclusively for Elon Musk on private jets, offering rare insight into the billionaire\u2019s airborne lifestyle, as per a report by Bloomberg. The document, first reported by Bloomberg, provides flight attendants with precise instructions on how to cater to the personal and professional preferences of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, reflecting the meticulous attention given to his comfort and routine while in transit. Speed, Silence and Solitude: Inside the Jet Cabin According to the hacked manual, Elon Musk prefers direct and rapid routes regardless of fuel efficiency, a somewhat paradoxical position for the head of an electric vehicle empire known for sustainability. \u201cMr. Musk isn\u2019t interested in conserving fuel,\u201d the memo states, noting that his priority is to \u201cfly as quickly and as direct as possible.\u201d Live Events Onboard, the environment is kept controlled to Musk\u2019s liking: a cool cabin temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit, dimmed lighting, and passenger vents turned off due to his aversion to background noise. Unexpected Wi-Fi dropouts are to be avoided at all costs, and staff are advised not to offer unsolicited help with technology, as Musk considers himself \u201cself-sufficient.\u201d Gaming in the Sky: Musk\u2019s Late-Night Livestreams Beyond the logistics of luxury travel, Musk has been using his time in the air to test Starlink\u2019s airborne connectivity, streaming video games from his private jet to millions of viewers. In a recent livestream that attracted over 16 million views, Musk played for 44 minutes, occasionally commenting on topics ranging from turbulence and artificial intelligence to the upcoming season of \"Diablo IV.\" Speaking into the camera in the early hours of April 10, he reflected on personal challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of a stressful week, frankly. But today was a good day,\u201d Musk said, moments before resuming gameplay. These livestreams, often broadcast under his alias @cyb3rgam3r420, have become a regular feature of his travel routine, even showing glimpses of his son or spontaneous thoughts about Roman military history or Tesla\u2019s future tech ventures. Gaming Under Scrutiny Despite the casual tone of these videos, Musk has faced criticism within the gaming community. A previous exchange with a YouTuber, NikoWrex, suggested Musk may have considered \"account boosting\" \u2014 a controversial practice where gamers pay others to improve their rankings. The allegation drew ire from gamers and even prompted snark from official game accounts. Musk, while never officially commenting on the claims, did amplify the video in question. However, critics argue that his recent \u201chardcore mode\u201d failures during livestreams \u2014 including multiple in-game deaths and connection issues \u2014 cast doubt on his self-professed gaming prowess. FAQs What was leaked in the NetJets cyberattack? Internal documents from NetJets, a private aviation company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, were leaked following a cyberattack. These include a confidential service guide specifically tailored for Elon Musk, offering detailed insight into his travel preferences and routines aboard private jets. What does the guide reveal about Elon Musk\u2019s travel preferences? Musk prefers fast, direct flights regardless of fuel efficiency. He also requires a cabin temperature of 65\u00b0F, dim lighting, and no use of passenger air vents to reduce background noise. Flight attendants are instructed not to offer tech assistance unless asked.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other AI stocks catching Wall Street\u2019s attention. In the latest development in the feud between OpenAI and Elon Musk, the ChatGPT maker has countersued billionaire Musk, citing a pattern of harassment. The company also asked a federal judge to stop Musk from any \u201cfurther unlawful and unfair action\u201d against OpenAI in a court case over the company\u2019s future structure that has fueled the AI revolution. OpenAI claims that Musk has tried \u201cnonstop\u201d to slow down its business for his benefit, accusing him of using \u201cbad-faith tactics\u201d against it to help him control AI technology. Musk has been actively seeking to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a \u201cfor-profit\u201d company, claiming that the transition will be a bad idea, which prioritizes commercial interests and compromises its mission of benefiting humanity. OpenAI, however, denies these allegations. The company must complete its transition by the end of the year if it seeks to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round. If the transition fails to complete by year-end, the funding will likely be reduced to US$20 billion. READ NOW: 10 AI Stocks to Watch Now and 9 Trending AI Stocks Making Headlines Today \u201cThrough press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk\u2019s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI\u2019s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,\u201d In response, Musk\u2019s legal team has referred to a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium. This bid was rejected by OpenAI. \u201cHad OpenAI\u2019s Board genuinely considered the bid as they were obligated to do they would have seen how serious it was. It\u2019s telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI\u2019s assets allegedly \u2018interferes\u2019 with their business plans.\u201d For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. The hedge fund data is as of Q4 2024. Story Continues Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points ( see more details here ). Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): AI Vision Versus EV Weakness - Goldman Balances Long-Term Hopes with Near-Term Risks Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On April 10, Goldman Sachs reiterated the stock as \u201cNeutral\u201d and cut its price target on the stock to $260 per share from $275. \u201cFor Tesla , we believe that weaker auto demand/consumer sentiment, tariff costs (including in Energy), and US EV policy risk are offset by longer-term potential from its AI related efforts;\u201d Overall, TSLA ranks 8th on our list of AI stocks catching Wall Street\u2019s attention. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Recommended Videos The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broadly. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. The electronics exemption is the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies \u2014 including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \u2014 who are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

Elon Musk. Elon Musk has been steadily losing popularity among Americans, according to claims made by pollster Nate Silver in his latest tracker. However, Silver's assessment has drawn sharp retort from Tesla CEO Musk who blasted the ratings as \"political propaganda war\". \"We just launched an Elon Musk popularity tracker to accompany our Trump approval tracker. Currently, he's at a \u221214 as compared with Trump's \u22125,\" Silver posted on Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter). Replying to Silver's tweet, Musk wrote, \"The inevitable outcome of having a political propaganda war waged against me while I have almost no countervailing campaign and, at times, digging my own grave way better than my enemies do.\" Silver \"Do Americans have a favorable or unfavorable view of Elon Musk\" tracker shows statistics from January 1, 2024 till April 1, 2025. The timeline comprises Musk's endorsement for then Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump, US President elections, and Donald Trump's inauguration and subsequent decisions that Trump administration has taken. Earlier on Thursday, two U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers on Thursday asked the Transportation Department's top ethics official to detail how the agency is addressing Elon Musk's potential conflicts of interest given ongoing investigations of SpaceX and Tesla, companies run by the close ally of President Donald Trump. Live Events Meanwhile, Ireland's data privacy watchdog said on Friday it's investigating Elon Musk's social media platform X over its use of personal data to train his artificial intelligence chatbot Grok. The Data Protection Commission said it has opened an inquiry into \"the processing of personal data comprised in publicly-accessible posts\" that European users posted on X. FAQs Q1.

In a bold interview with EFN, Gardell called Tesla\u2019s valuation \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and pointed to slowing sales, Elon Musk\u2019s political drama, and Cybertruck struggles as red flags. While Tesla leads in EV innovation, Gardell warns the bubble could soon burst. Swedish billionaire Christer Gardell warns Tesla stock may crash 95%. He says the valuation is unrealistic and linked to Elon Musk\u2019s controversies, falling sales, and Cybertruck struggles Swedish billionaire and hedge fund manager Christer Gardell has issued a stark warning that\u2019s now catching the attention of Tesla investors worldwide. According to Gardell, Tesla\u2019s market valuation is \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and could plummet by up to 95% \u2014 and possibly sooner than many might expect. In a recent interview with Swedish finance channel EFN, Gardell didn\u2019t hold back. He pointed to a mix of slowing sales, rising controversy around CEO Elon Musk, and what he sees as wildly overinflated stock value. Why is Christer Gardell calling Tesla\u2019s valuation a ticking time bomb? Tesla's current market value sits in the hundreds of billions of dollars. But Gardell, who runs activist hedge fund Cevian Capital, says that figure doesn\u2019t align with Tesla\u2019s core business. \u201cTesla, especially now with the whole Musk circus going on everywhere, is probably the most expensive stock on the global stock exchanges right now,\u201d Gardell said in the EFN interview, as reported by Teslarati . \u201cIt could go down 95% \u2013 and maybe it should go down 95%.\u201d He clarified that it\u2019s hard to predict an exact timeline \u2014 \u201cIt could happen in a month, six months, a year, three years, or five years,\u201d he said. But in his eyes, a drop is coming. And when it hits, it could be steep. Live Events What\u2019s driving fears of a Tesla stock crash? Tesla has moved beyond just being an electric carmaker. The company now deals in robotics and AI, which are both major growth areas. But Gardell emphasized that, at its core, Tesla is still an automaker \u2014 and compared to its peers, its stock is way out of proportion. According to Companies Market Cap , Tesla\u2019s valuation is more than triple that of major auto giants like Toyota and Volkswagen. Yet, Tesla\u2019s recent sales trends are not keeping up. Sales have dipped in key markets, and the controversial public presence of Elon Musk hasn\u2019t helped. As political tensions around Musk grow \u2014 especially in the U.S. \u2014 some analysts worry that Tesla\u2019s reputation could be taking a long-term hit. That\u2019s not just bad PR; it could mean real consequences for investor confidence. On top of that, Tesla\u2019s highly anticipated Cybertruck is underperforming. While Musk once projected annual sales of 500,000 units, current figures suggest it\u2019s not even hitting 10% of that. To move the product, Tesla has been forced to adjust financing options and offer more attractive interest rates to buyers. Could a Tesla crash ripple through the EV market? Despite Tesla's struggles, the broader EV market continues to thrive. In fact, Q4 2024 saw a new record for EV sales in the U.S., according to Cox Automotive . People are still switching to electric vehicles in large numbers, attracted by long-term savings and environmental benefits. But here\u2019s the concern: If Tesla's valuation tanks, will it scare investors away from other EV companies too? It's a real risk. Gardell's worry is that an overvalued company like Tesla might damage broader investor trust in green tech if it falls too hard and too fast. Still, it's not all bad news for EV buyers. As Tesla trims prices and tweaks financing to maintain demand, competitors may follow suit. That could lead to better deals for consumers, not just from Tesla but across the EV landscape. Should investors start looking beyond U.S. tech stocks? Gardell believes the stock market imbalance between the U.S. and Europe is reaching historic levels. \u201cThe difference between American stocks and European stocks has never been greater,\u201d he told EFN. For cautious investors, this may be a moment to reconsider their strategy. European equities, in his view, are offering more realistic valuations. And with companies in Europe also expanding into the EV and clean energy space, there may be opportunities to invest in future-forward industries without the same bubble risk. FAQs: Why did Christer Gardell warn about a Tesla stock crash ? He said Tesla\u2019s value is too high and could drop by 95%. How could Tesla\u2019s stock affect the electric vehicle market? A crash could shake investor trust in EV companies.

And while many of us might not quite be billionaires just yet, a handful of Georgians already are. Forbes released its annual list of the world\u2019s richest people earlier this week, with a total net worth between them all of $16.1 trillion. The richest man in the world saw his worth skyrocket in the last year. Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk currently has a net worth of $342 billion, according to Forbes. Last year, he had a total of $195 billion, their data lists. [DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks ] But the richest Georgians are the children of Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A founder Truett Cathy, who died in 2014. Bubba and Dan Cathy now run the fast food powerhouse together. The brothers and their sister, Trudy Cathy White, each have a net worth of $11.4 billion, which is slightly higher than last year\u2019s $11.2 billion. Metro Atlanta-based Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank has a current net worth of $9 billion, according to Forbes. Blank also owns the Atlanta Falcons and opened Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta - Arthur M. Blank Hospital in September . His fellow Home Depot co-founder, Bernie Marcus, passed away in November .

He ran Georgia-based pest control company Rollins, Inc. with his brother, Randall, who died in 2020. Rollins, Inc. is the biggest pest control company by revenue in North America, according to Forbes. Jim Kennedy is the chairman emeritus of media and automotive company Cox Enterprises. He inherited his stake in the Cox Family-owned business based in Atlanta from his mother when she died in 2007. Kennedy\u2019s current net worth is $6.6 billion.

In his spare time, James is a long-suffering Rochdale fan and loves reading, running and music. Contact him via [email protected] X @ JimmyMoorhouse Advert Advert Advert Love him or hate him, Elon Musk has been part of some pretty wild projects over the years. Having one of his own cars up in space is perhaps one of the most random. While the Space X founder has lost plenty on Tesla stock in recent months, with Donald Trump 's tariffs only leaving more holes in his pocket , he remains the world's richest man and probably doesn't blink twice when a couple of million evaporates from his bank account. The businessman has taken on more of a political role since Trump's return to the Oval Office. This has hardly done much for the 53-year-old's controversial image, and it seems as though the South African's best work has been beyond Earth's orbit, given the success of various space projects over the years. Running a space company and a car business simultaneously, if you've got a mind like Musk, it's likely you'd put two and two together and send a Tesla up to the stars - and that's exactly what he did in 2018. Advert The Tesla Roadster was ejected into space as a dummy payload for a Falcon Heavy test flight. It's fitted with a mannequin in a space suit called Starman - a tongue-in-cheek nod to the David Bowie classic. The Bowie song Space Oddity was also set up to play on repeat through the vehicle's sound system. The SpaceX team also chucked a Hot Wheels car and a copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy inside for good measure. Elon Musk (Graeme Sloan for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Musk previously revealed exactly why he sent the Tesla Roadster skyward, saying that he hoped that humanity would end up living on other planets and that his 'descendants will be able to drag it [the car] back to a museum'. The chances of that may seem pretty low, but the more kids Musk has, the more those chances improve. Musk has also said that he wanted to put the 'silliest' thing he and his SpaceX team could think of out of Earth's orbit, and apparently they settled on a car. Gosh, Elon, your imagination knows no bounds! Anyway, after seven years in space travelling at speeds well above 10,000 mph, you might think that it's tricky to keep track of the Roadster, but fortunately, like nearly everything these days, there's a website for that. Advert The \u2018Where is Roadster?\u2019 site keeps track of the Tesla as it zooms through space. At the time of writing, it is currently 228,647,460 miles from Earth. However, it's travelling back towards its home planet at the lightning-fast speed of 16,106 mph. A real space oddity... (SpaceX via Getty Images) That means that its speed has increased by 5,000 mph in the last week alone. Maybe it's homesick and wants to get back in time for Christmas, learning an important lesson from the NASA astronauts who end up spending far too long away from Earth. So what happens when the space car does finally come back home? Well, Musk could land himself in real trouble if the Tesla does crash land back to Earth. As long as it steers clear of any humans or man-made objects and doesn't cause any damage, it seems as if the billionaire will get away with it. Hopefully it avoids the likes of Mount Kilimanjaro and Niagara Falls, too.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Recommended Videos The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broadly. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. The electronics exemption is the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies \u2014 including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \u2014 who are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies \u2014 including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \u2014 who are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

But in many ways, the deal made sense. xAI\u2019s chatbot, Grok, was already deeply integrated with X, X was floundering financially , and Musk needed a way to make his $44 billion Twitter acquisition look less like an impulsive takeover and more like a strategic play for AGI dominance. It also pointed to something deeper about how Musk\u2019s empire works: investing in any one of his companies isn\u2019t about a quick return on investment. It\u2019s about buying into the mysticism around Musk and swallowing whole a narrative of success that outpaces the actual numbers. Some call it a grift , pointing to Musk\u2019s history of overpromising and underdelivering . But the market is increasingly more tolerant \u2013 welcoming, even \u2013 of narrative-led investments, particularly when the thread that ties the tale together is one of the president\u2019s right-hand men. \u201cAll of Elon\u2019s companies today are basically one company,\u201d Yoni Rechtman, a principal at Slow Ventures, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s all already Elon, Inc. There are people who work across multiple companies simultaneously. They share a web of capital connections. They do business with one another, and he treats them all effectively as one company. So [the xAI-X merger] just ends some of the fiction that the two businesses were separate.\u201d The thinking among Musk bulls like Ron Baron, the founder of investment management firm Baron Capital, is that \u201cevery single thing [Musk] does is helping everything else he does,\u201d as Baron phrased it . Other businesses under Musk\u2019s control include Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink \u2013 some of which reportedly share resources . \u201cWhen [Musk] bought Twitter, did he have in his mind that there\u2019s an opportunity to have this data, a tremendous value for licensing? When he decided he wanted to go to Mars with SpaceX, did he really think initially that there\u2019s a real opportunity here for the internet around the world, and there\u2019s gonna be hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue opportunity? When he started off with EVs for Tesla, did he really think that this is gonna merge into self-driving, where you can make hundreds of billions of dollars a year of extra profits, and Grok [\u2026] and you\u2019re gonna have connected cars all around the world? [\u2026] All these businesses link up. It\u2019s the ecosystem. It\u2019s the Elon ecosystem, and I think it\u2019s really interesting when you look at it that way.\u201d Baron Capital has invested across Musk\u2019s ecosystem, an example of the investor crossover between the billionaire\u2019s various companies. Firms like 8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, DFJ Growth, Fidelity Investments, Manhattan Venture Partners, Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF, Sequoia Capital, Vy Capital, and others also hold positions throughout Musk\u2019s corporate web. That brings us back to the xAI-X deal. Pundits questioned how the acquisition could value X at $33 billion, more than triple its valuation just a few months ago, and how it could value xAI at $80 billion considering the AI company reportedly has little in the way of revenue. But valuations aren\u2019t always based on what exists today. Rather, they take into account what investors are hoping for \u2013 and that\u2019s particularly true when it comes to Musk\u2019s ventures. Just look at Tesla. The electric vehicle maker has been treated like a tech stock for years despite the fact that it has automaker margins , based largely on the belief that Tesla will one day unlock groundbreaking autonomy in the form of self-driving cars and humanoid robots. \u201cThe reason why [Tesla\u2019s] stock trades at 80 times earnings and the comp group trades at 25 times earnings is that people are making a bet on the long term, and it\u2019s not about what happens to numbers this year,\u201d Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told TechCrunch. \u201cThat\u2019s one of Elon\u2019s superpowers, this ability to keep investors engaged for the long term.\u201d Munster\u2019s firm has invested in X, xAI, and Tesla. It\u2019s exactly the type of all-in Musk backer that stands to benefit the most from a deal like xAI buying X, assuming Musk can indeed deliver on his pledge of marrying X\u2019s real-time data trove and distribution platform with xAI\u2019s infrastructure and AI expertise. Of course, consolidated value also comes with increased risk. Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School whose research lies at the intersection of business and society, told TechCrunch that the biggest immediate risk factor for investors is the ongoing lawsuit that X is facing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The suit accuses Musk of misleading investors by delaying the disclosure of his previous investments in Twitter. The SEC has argued that this allowed Musk to buy more Twitter shares at artificially low prices. Wang listed a few other risk considerations, such as anticompetition and user privacy concerns, particularly regarding how X quietly opted all users into data collection for AI model training. The opt-in change has already raised the ire of one regulator, Ireland\u2019s DPC , which recently began investigating it as a potential breach of Europe\u2019s GDPR law. \u201cAnother kind of risk here is that there isn\u2019t a consensus framework for how the AI market is going to be regulated, but you\u2019re already seeing traces of this in Europe and, up until recently, in California,\u201d Wang said. \u201cA lot of these frameworks have to do with how AI models are deployed in terms of distributing information [\u2026] They ascribe responsibility to the companies that are creating AI models, as well as providing access to those models.\u201d Musk might also simply lose interest in a project, Rechtman said. \u201cI think that is what a lot of Tesla shareholders are feeling right now,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere for the last several months, Elon\u2019s number one company has been the Trump campaign, and his other projects have languished.\u201d When asked about some of these risk factors, Munster appeared nonplussed. He suggested they\u2019re inconsequential given the enormity of, for example, xAI\u2019s value proposition and potential to become a dominant player in AI. \u201cWe\u2019re betting the firm on the belief that AI is going to be more transformative than what people think,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the value [\u2026] of one of the four brains that the world is going to run on?\u201d Rechtman said that Musk bulls aren\u2019t blindly loyal, per se, but simply trust in Musk\u2019s superpower to \u201cbend capital markets to his will\u201d in a way that allows him to do things and build businesses that nobody else can. \u201cThe people who are in these businesses have just gone long Elon, and they will continue to go long Elon,\u201d Rechtman said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising to me that they will just continue to tell you that the emperor is wearing clothes.\u201d Not for nothing, buying into Musk\u2019s more speculative bets, like X, is one way to potentially unlock more investment opportunities in the Muskverse, Rechtman said. \u201cSpaceX is a real thing, and it will never go public,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the only way to invest in SpaceX is to get access to the tenders. And the only way to get access to the tenders is to be in Elon\u2019s good graces.\u201d Topics AI , Elon Musk , Grok , Social , X , xAI Rebecca Bellan Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk\u2019s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.
