(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

Elon Musk. Elon Musk has been steadily losing popularity among Americans, according to claims made by pollster Nate Silver in his latest tracker. However, Silver's assessment has drawn sharp retort from Tesla CEO Musk who blasted the ratings as \"political propaganda war\". \"We just launched an Elon Musk popularity tracker to accompany our Trump approval tracker. Currently, he's at a \u221214 as compared with Trump's \u22125,\" Silver posted on Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter). Replying to Silver's tweet, Musk wrote, \"The inevitable outcome of having a political propaganda war waged against me while I have almost no countervailing campaign and, at times, digging my own grave way better than my enemies do.\" Silver \"Do Americans have a favorable or unfavorable view of Elon Musk\" tracker shows statistics from January 1, 2024 till April 1, 2025. The timeline comprises Musk's endorsement for then Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump, US President elections, and Donald Trump's inauguration and subsequent decisions that Trump administration has taken. Earlier on Thursday, two U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers on Thursday asked the Transportation Department's top ethics official to detail how the agency is addressing Elon Musk's potential conflicts of interest given ongoing investigations of SpaceX and Tesla, companies run by the close ally of President Donald Trump. Live Events Meanwhile, Ireland's data privacy watchdog said on Friday it's investigating Elon Musk's social media platform X over its use of personal data to train his artificial intelligence chatbot Grok. The Data Protection Commission said it has opened an inquiry into \"the processing of personal data comprised in publicly-accessible posts\" that European users posted on X. FAQs Q1.

In a bold interview with EFN, Gardell called Tesla\u2019s valuation \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and pointed to slowing sales, Elon Musk\u2019s political drama, and Cybertruck struggles as red flags. While Tesla leads in EV innovation, Gardell warns the bubble could soon burst. Swedish billionaire Christer Gardell warns Tesla stock may crash 95%. He says the valuation is unrealistic and linked to Elon Musk\u2019s controversies, falling sales, and Cybertruck struggles Swedish billionaire and hedge fund manager Christer Gardell has issued a stark warning that\u2019s now catching the attention of Tesla investors worldwide. According to Gardell, Tesla\u2019s market valuation is \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and could plummet by up to 95% \u2014 and possibly sooner than many might expect. In a recent interview with Swedish finance channel EFN, Gardell didn\u2019t hold back. He pointed to a mix of slowing sales, rising controversy around CEO Elon Musk, and what he sees as wildly overinflated stock value. Why is Christer Gardell calling Tesla\u2019s valuation a ticking time bomb? Tesla's current market value sits in the hundreds of billions of dollars. But Gardell, who runs activist hedge fund Cevian Capital, says that figure doesn\u2019t align with Tesla\u2019s core business. \u201cTesla, especially now with the whole Musk circus going on everywhere, is probably the most expensive stock on the global stock exchanges right now,\u201d Gardell said in the EFN interview, as reported by Teslarati . \u201cIt could go down 95% \u2013 and maybe it should go down 95%.\u201d He clarified that it\u2019s hard to predict an exact timeline \u2014 \u201cIt could happen in a month, six months, a year, three years, or five years,\u201d he said. But in his eyes, a drop is coming. And when it hits, it could be steep. Live Events What\u2019s driving fears of a Tesla stock crash? Tesla has moved beyond just being an electric carmaker. The company now deals in robotics and AI, which are both major growth areas. But Gardell emphasized that, at its core, Tesla is still an automaker \u2014 and compared to its peers, its stock is way out of proportion. According to Companies Market Cap , Tesla\u2019s valuation is more than triple that of major auto giants like Toyota and Volkswagen. Yet, Tesla\u2019s recent sales trends are not keeping up. Sales have dipped in key markets, and the controversial public presence of Elon Musk hasn\u2019t helped. As political tensions around Musk grow \u2014 especially in the U.S. \u2014 some analysts worry that Tesla\u2019s reputation could be taking a long-term hit. That\u2019s not just bad PR; it could mean real consequences for investor confidence. On top of that, Tesla\u2019s highly anticipated Cybertruck is underperforming. While Musk once projected annual sales of 500,000 units, current figures suggest it\u2019s not even hitting 10% of that. To move the product, Tesla has been forced to adjust financing options and offer more attractive interest rates to buyers. Could a Tesla crash ripple through the EV market? Despite Tesla's struggles, the broader EV market continues to thrive. In fact, Q4 2024 saw a new record for EV sales in the U.S., according to Cox Automotive . People are still switching to electric vehicles in large numbers, attracted by long-term savings and environmental benefits. But here\u2019s the concern: If Tesla's valuation tanks, will it scare investors away from other EV companies too? It's a real risk. Gardell's worry is that an overvalued company like Tesla might damage broader investor trust in green tech if it falls too hard and too fast. Still, it's not all bad news for EV buyers. As Tesla trims prices and tweaks financing to maintain demand, competitors may follow suit. That could lead to better deals for consumers, not just from Tesla but across the EV landscape. Should investors start looking beyond U.S. tech stocks? Gardell believes the stock market imbalance between the U.S. and Europe is reaching historic levels. \u201cThe difference between American stocks and European stocks has never been greater,\u201d he told EFN. For cautious investors, this may be a moment to reconsider their strategy. European equities, in his view, are offering more realistic valuations. And with companies in Europe also expanding into the EV and clean energy space, there may be opportunities to invest in future-forward industries without the same bubble risk. FAQs: Why did Christer Gardell warn about a Tesla stock crash ? He said Tesla\u2019s value is too high and could drop by 95%. How could Tesla\u2019s stock affect the electric vehicle market? A crash could shake investor trust in EV companies.

Having one of his own cars up in space is perhaps one of the most random. While the Space X founder has lost plenty on Tesla stock in recent months, with Donald Trump 's tariffs only leaving more holes in his pocket , he remains the world's richest man and probably doesn't blink twice when a couple of million evaporates from his bank account. The businessman has taken on more of a political role since Trump's return to the Oval Office. This has hardly done much for the 53-year-old's controversial image, and it seems as though the South African's best work has been beyond Earth's orbit, given the success of various space projects over the years. Running a space company and a car business simultaneously, if you've got a mind like Musk, it's likely you'd put two and two together and send a Tesla up to the stars - and that's exactly what he did in 2018. Advert The Tesla Roadster was ejected into space as a dummy payload for a Falcon Heavy test flight. It's fitted with a mannequin in a space suit called Starman - a tongue-in-cheek nod to the David Bowie classic. The Bowie song Space Oddity was also set up to play on repeat through the vehicle's sound system. The SpaceX team also chucked a Hot Wheels car and a copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy inside for good measure. Elon Musk (Graeme Sloan for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Musk previously revealed exactly why he sent the Tesla Roadster skyward, saying that he hoped that humanity would end up living on other planets and that his 'descendants will be able to drag it [the car] back to a museum'. The chances of that may seem pretty low, but the more kids Musk has, the more those chances improve. Musk has also said that he wanted to put the 'silliest' thing he and his SpaceX team could think of out of Earth's orbit, and apparently they settled on a car. Gosh, Elon, your imagination knows no bounds! Anyway, after seven years in space travelling at speeds well above 10,000 mph, you might think that it's tricky to keep track of the Roadster, but fortunately, like nearly everything these days, there's a website for that. Advert The \u2018Where is Roadster?\u2019 site keeps track of the Tesla as it zooms through space. At the time of writing, it is currently 228,647,460 miles from Earth. However, it's travelling back towards its home planet at the lightning-fast speed of 16,106 mph. A real space oddity... (SpaceX via Getty Images) That means that its speed has increased by 5,000 mph in the last week alone. Maybe it's homesick and wants to get back in time for Christmas, learning an important lesson from the NASA astronauts who end up spending far too long away from Earth. So what happens when the space car does finally come back home? Well, Musk could land himself in real trouble if the Tesla does crash land back to Earth.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights.

But in many ways, the deal made sense. xAI\u2019s chatbot, Grok, was already deeply integrated with X, X was floundering financially , and Musk needed a way to make his $44 billion Twitter acquisition look less like an impulsive takeover and more like a strategic play for AGI dominance. It also pointed to something deeper about how Musk\u2019s empire works: investing in any one of his companies isn\u2019t about a quick return on investment. It\u2019s about buying into the mysticism around Musk and swallowing whole a narrative of success that outpaces the actual numbers. Some call it a grift , pointing to Musk\u2019s history of overpromising and underdelivering . But the market is increasingly more tolerant \u2013 welcoming, even \u2013 of narrative-led investments, particularly when the thread that ties the tale together is one of the president\u2019s right-hand men. \u201cAll of Elon\u2019s companies today are basically one company,\u201d Yoni Rechtman, a principal at Slow Ventures, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s all already Elon, Inc. There are people who work across multiple companies simultaneously. They share a web of capital connections. They do business with one another, and he treats them all effectively as one company. So [the xAI-X merger] just ends some of the fiction that the two businesses were separate.\u201d The thinking among Musk bulls like Ron Baron, the founder of investment management firm Baron Capital, is that \u201cevery single thing [Musk] does is helping everything else he does,\u201d as Baron phrased it . Other businesses under Musk\u2019s control include Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink \u2013 some of which reportedly share resources . \u201cWhen [Musk] bought Twitter, did he have in his mind that there\u2019s an opportunity to have this data, a tremendous value for licensing? When he decided he wanted to go to Mars with SpaceX, did he really think initially that there\u2019s a real opportunity here for the internet around the world, and there\u2019s gonna be hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue opportunity? When he started off with EVs for Tesla, did he really think that this is gonna merge into self-driving, where you can make hundreds of billions of dollars a year of extra profits, and Grok [\u2026] and you\u2019re gonna have connected cars all around the world? [\u2026] All these businesses link up. It\u2019s the ecosystem. It\u2019s the Elon ecosystem, and I think it\u2019s really interesting when you look at it that way.\u201d Baron Capital has invested across Musk\u2019s ecosystem, an example of the investor crossover between the billionaire\u2019s various companies. Firms like 8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, DFJ Growth, Fidelity Investments, Manhattan Venture Partners, Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF, Sequoia Capital, Vy Capital, and others also hold positions throughout Musk\u2019s corporate web. That brings us back to the xAI-X deal. Pundits questioned how the acquisition could value X at $33 billion, more than triple its valuation just a few months ago, and how it could value xAI at $80 billion considering the AI company reportedly has little in the way of revenue. But valuations aren\u2019t always based on what exists today. Rather, they take into account what investors are hoping for \u2013 and that\u2019s particularly true when it comes to Musk\u2019s ventures. Just look at Tesla. The electric vehicle maker has been treated like a tech stock for years despite the fact that it has automaker margins , based largely on the belief that Tesla will one day unlock groundbreaking autonomy in the form of self-driving cars and humanoid robots. \u201cThe reason why [Tesla\u2019s] stock trades at 80 times earnings and the comp group trades at 25 times earnings is that people are making a bet on the long term, and it\u2019s not about what happens to numbers this year,\u201d Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told TechCrunch. \u201cThat\u2019s one of Elon\u2019s superpowers, this ability to keep investors engaged for the long term.\u201d Munster\u2019s firm has invested in X, xAI, and Tesla. It\u2019s exactly the type of all-in Musk backer that stands to benefit the most from a deal like xAI buying X, assuming Musk can indeed deliver on his pledge of marrying X\u2019s real-time data trove and distribution platform with xAI\u2019s infrastructure and AI expertise. Of course, consolidated value also comes with increased risk. Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School whose research lies at the intersection of business and society, told TechCrunch that the biggest immediate risk factor for investors is the ongoing lawsuit that X is facing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The suit accuses Musk of misleading investors by delaying the disclosure of his previous investments in Twitter. The SEC has argued that this allowed Musk to buy more Twitter shares at artificially low prices. Wang listed a few other risk considerations, such as anticompetition and user privacy concerns, particularly regarding how X quietly opted all users into data collection for AI model training. The opt-in change has already raised the ire of one regulator, Ireland\u2019s DPC , which recently began investigating it as a potential breach of Europe\u2019s GDPR law. \u201cAnother kind of risk here is that there isn\u2019t a consensus framework for how the AI market is going to be regulated, but you\u2019re already seeing traces of this in Europe and, up until recently, in California,\u201d Wang said. \u201cA lot of these frameworks have to do with how AI models are deployed in terms of distributing information [\u2026] They ascribe responsibility to the companies that are creating AI models, as well as providing access to those models.\u201d Musk might also simply lose interest in a project, Rechtman said. \u201cI think that is what a lot of Tesla shareholders are feeling right now,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere for the last several months, Elon\u2019s number one company has been the Trump campaign, and his other projects have languished.\u201d When asked about some of these risk factors, Munster appeared nonplussed. He suggested they\u2019re inconsequential given the enormity of, for example, xAI\u2019s value proposition and potential to become a dominant player in AI. \u201cWe\u2019re betting the firm on the belief that AI is going to be more transformative than what people think,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the value [\u2026] of one of the four brains that the world is going to run on?\u201d Rechtman said that Musk bulls aren\u2019t blindly loyal, per se, but simply trust in Musk\u2019s superpower to \u201cbend capital markets to his will\u201d in a way that allows him to do things and build businesses that nobody else can. \u201cThe people who are in these businesses have just gone long Elon, and they will continue to go long Elon,\u201d Rechtman said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising to me that they will just continue to tell you that the emperor is wearing clothes.\u201d Not for nothing, buying into Musk\u2019s more speculative bets, like X, is one way to potentially unlock more investment opportunities in the Muskverse, Rechtman said. \u201cSpaceX is a real thing, and it will never go public,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the only way to invest in SpaceX is to get access to the tenders. And the only way to get access to the tenders is to be in Elon\u2019s good graces.\u201d Topics AI , Elon Musk , Grok , Social , X , xAI Rebecca Bellan Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk\u2019s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.

Join Our WhatsApp Channel Business Today Desk Updated Apr 12, 2025, 7:09 PM IST One brutally honest Reddit post, now viral, cuts through the optimism often sold with overseas education. Taking out an education loan to chase the American dream might seem like a calculated risk \u2014 but for many Indian students, it\u2019s becoming a gamble with high personal and financial stakes. Rising tuition costs, unforgiving interest rates, and a harsh job market can turn that dream into a prolonged period of debt, stress, and isolation.

It's a raw, first-hand account from an Indian student in the US, who says it like it is: don\u2019t come here unless you're fully prepared to weather the storm. In a viral Reddit post advising Indian students planning to study in the US, a student with a Master of Science degree offered a no-holds-barred account of what it\u2019s really like to pursue higher education abroad with the help of a loan. \u201cMy Indian perspective is don't take loan and come here coz you ll dry out soon if you can't find anything solid,\u201d the post began. \u201cI do see many people who get job but I see a lot more without right now.\u201d The student didn\u2019t sugarcoat the costs or risks, warning that $30/hour is not enough to live comfortably when factoring in rent, insurance, groceries, and other essentials. \u201cThere are people who have done some illegitimate jobs as they ran out and few got caught and had their sevis terminated,\u201d the user wrote, referencing cases where visa violations led to deportations. Housing conditions during studies were described as cramped and costly. \u201cIf you are in the bay one shared room is shared by 3 people where each pay 600 dollars min each excluding utils when they are studying,\u201d the post said. Internship and job opportunities, the user added, come with a bureaucratic maze and skepticism from employers unwilling to sponsor visas. \u201cYou\u2019ll see many jobs which you'd fit perfect for say that they don't sponsor and you not to apply.\u201d Burnout is real, the post emphasized, especially with new H-1B fees jumping to $2,500. \u201cThe companies aren't trying a lot.\u201d Mental health challenges were also starkly laid out. \u201cI am literally living paycheck by paycheck as I took a huge loan with an interest of 12/annum...There are many lonely days. If you get sick, you don't got nobody to take care of you...Therapists here charge 100-200+$/hr, insurance won't cover.\u201d Despite applying for 500 internships, the user reported landing only two interviews. \u201cI code and social better than people with no experience who got into meta, Tesla, Amazon with referrals...Some of them cheat,\u201d they wrote, claiming that companies sometimes re-post filled roles to manipulate visa quotas. The post touched on subtle and overt racism, both from locals and fellow Indians. \u201cPeople think Indians are cheap which is slightly true coz of all the above reasons...Also you'd face more racism from other Indians as well.\u201d Still, the user acknowledged moments of kindness and community: \u201cYou get free stuff off the road...Many events give you free food...temples, churches and gurudwaras give you free food.\u201d \u201cYes if you can bear all that. Come aboard. Cheers,\u201d the post concluded. Other users echoed the sentiment. One wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to save money here...If you came to US a decade ago, it was all worth it, but sure won\u2019t recommend it now.\u201d Not everyone agreed with the bleak tone. \u201cWhy do everyone here thinks that all students are doing cs...US is the only place, which has most opportunities,\u201d a user countered. Another added, \u201cCivil companies are actively hiring...I agree that eventually everyone would have to return back to India unless they marry someone there.\u201d Published on: Apr 12, 2025, 7:08 PM IST Subscribe To Newsletter Follow Us on Channel \u00d7 TOP STORIES TOP VIDEOS Economy Corporate Markets Trending Magazine COVID-19 Infra Pharma Real Estate Stocks Auto World Education Jobs Lifestyle About us Contact us Advertise with us Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Partners Press Releases Design Partner Copyright\u00a92025 Living Media India Limited.

Tweet Share Share Comment Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Getty Images Plus. Sign up for the Surge , the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday. Welcome to this week\u2019s edition of the Surge, a newsletter about all things politics in the United States, a place that can now be considered an emerging market country. Hey, here\u2019s some news: Your money is gone, forever. It\u2019s called the \u201cArt of the Deal.\u201d At least we\u2019ve still got Medicaid for bare-bones health ca\u2014oops, maybe not? What a week for the American pocketbook. Democrats\u2019 crippling addiction to nuance, meanwhile, is preventing some of them from saying the very easy sentence \u201cTrump killed the economy.\u201d And for ulcer-related reasons, we\u2019re not even touching the court cases involving the Trump administration\u2019s arbitrary kidnappings\u2014read the Slate legal people for that. Much is going on. Can anyone\u2014or any \u2026 thing\u2014stop it? 1. The bond market If there\u2019s anything that can get through to Trump \u2026 Last week, Donald Trump set in place a tariff plan that, if carried through, would at least cause a recession and at most put an end to our American-led economic and international order. He then played golf four days in a row. (Respect.) He and his team didn\u2019t necessarily mind the stock market going down 10 or 15 percent\u2014supposedly that would be the temporary pain. The more worrisome sign came when the bond market began to careen off the edge. One particular red alert was how the yield on 10-year Treasurys was shooting directly up, when typically, they should be a safe haven for investors in bear markets. That\u2019s one of those existential signs that the rest of the world is thinking about moving on from you. Trump\u2019s advisers publicly denied that the bond market had anything to do with the Wednesday decision to issue a 90-day \u201cpause\u201d on reciprocal tariffs. Privately, though, they said that was exactly the reason for the climb-down, and Trump himself conceded that markets were getting a little too \u201cyippy\u201d for his taste. Unfortunately, we\u2019re afraid Trump needs to take another look at the bond market. Despite a one-day stock market rally after Trump\u2019s \u201cpause\u201d\u2014which still left tariffs at their highest levels in 100 years\u2014everything resumed crashing by Thursday, with stocks and the dollar down and Treasury yields skyrocketing back up. This is the financial equivalent of someone (in this case, all other countries) breaking up with you via text. We know what we did. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement 2. Scott Bessent This goes well beyond positive reinforcement. We\u2019re still shocked by the spin that Bessent and these other dorks have been issuing since the \u201cpause\u201d to claim that everything is going according to plan. What really happened here is that Trump, who thinks that tariffs are a direct tax that the U.S. puts on other countries, did something impossibly reckless, because he could, and then had to begin walking it back. But his deputies have been tasked with conveying these actions as if he had just played the world. \u201cNo one creates leverage for himself like POTUS,\u201d Bessent posted. Commerce Secretary Howard \u201cGood Times\u201d Lutnick, sharing a screenshot of Trump\u2019s Truth Social post announcing the pause, wrote about how he and Bessent sat beside Trump as he drafted \u201cone of the most extraordinary Truth posts of his Presidency.\u201d White House policy chief Stephen Miller wrote that \u201cyou have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history.\u201d The only thing more head-spinning than some of these lines is that there\u2019s an audience that will believe it. 3. Mike Johnson Never a doubt. It was the House\u2019s turn this week to pass the compromise budget blueprint that the Senate passed last week, providing the skeletal structure for\u2014and finally allowing them to start real work on\u2014Trump\u2019s \u201cone big, beautiful bill.\u201d To recap, the \u201ccompromise\u201d that GOP leaders of both chambers struck was that they will make the difficult decisions later: The House would write a bill with bigger spending cuts, the Senate would write a bill with fewer, and they\u2019d come to some icky agreement irritating everyone in the end. (This could take several more months.) House conservatives, though, didn\u2019t like this. They wanted to straitjacket the Senate into big spending cuts now. And so we had another situation this week in which 10 or 20 House conservatives said they would never, ever, ever vote for this blueprint. The ins and outs weren\u2019t really worth paying attention to, because the holdouts\u2019 posture presented three options: First, they could\u2019ve voted to kill the blueprint, and with it, Trump\u2019s agenda (they didn\u2019t). Second, they could\u2019ve tried to negotiate again with the Senate on the blueprint, reopening talks on this never-ending first step just before both chambers went into a two-week recess (they would never). Third, the House conservatives could claim they got some \u201cassurances\u201d\u2014say, the speaker putting his job on the line \u2014about how spending cuts would definitely come later, vote to move the process along, and avoid Trump\u2019s wrath. That last option was always the only plausible one. The House passed the blueprint Thursday morning. Now it\u2019s time for them to write the bill. Plus vulnerable House Republicans have locked themselves into voting for a bill with hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts! Wishing everyone a good time. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement 4. Elon Musk and Peter Navarro The grand debates of towering statesmen. We haven\u2019t heard much from Elon Musk of late. That\u2019s partially because of how in the previous week, he made a Wisconsin judicial election a referendum on himself and biffed it. The day after that election, though, was \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d and the silence of Musk\u2014the richest businessman in history, whose companies do a lot of international commerce\u2014was revealing. It also didn\u2019t last. Before long, Musk was sniping on social media at Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s top trade adviser and the devil on Trump\u2019s shoulder urging on aggressive tariffs. He posted early last Saturday that Navarro\u2019s Ph.D. from Harvard was \u201ca bad thing, not a good thing,\u201d and that Navarro \u201cain\u2019t built shit.\u201d Navarro responded in an interview a couple of days later that Musk was merely a \u201ccar assembler,\u201d not a manufacturer, who imported Tesla parts from around the world. That really set Musk off. He called Navarro a \u201cmoron\u201d and \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks.\u201d In the latter post, he tagged the account \u201c@IfindRetards,\u201d and ultimately, he referred to Navarro as \u201cPeter Retarrdo.\u201d All very interesting stuff. It\u2019s worth emphasizing that these are two of the closest advisers to the president of the United States. Advertisement 5. Ken Paxton A big, expensive, stupid primary. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a MAGA showman who led a lawsuit to overturn the 2020 election and had also been impeached, though not convicted, by the state Legislature after nearly a decade of criminal investigations, announced a long-awaited primary challenge to Sen. John Cornyn this week. The dynamic is simple enough to understand: Paxton sees an opening to outflank Cornyn on craziness, as Cornyn is a normal human being who occasionally works to pass bipartisan legislation or expresses disapproval of some of Trump\u2019s actions. The two don\u2019t hide their despair of each other. Cornyn this week described Paxton as \u201ca con man and a fraud,\u201d and added that \u201cI am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him.\u201d The only thing motivating Paxton, Cornyn said, is \u201cvanity and personal ambition.\u201d This primary is going to be expensive and nasty at every turn. Regrettably, it\u2019s also going to force Cornyn, the sort of GOP senator you\u2019d like to have as even a modest check on Trump here or there, to behave like a caveman for the next year. Exhibit A: In March, Cornyn posted a photo of himself pretending to read The Art of the Deal in the kitchen with the caption \u201cRecommended.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement 6. Gretchen Whitmer A big, expensive, stupid primary. The adorable Democrats who still think there\u2019s going to be a presidential election in 2028 for them to run in were circling each other this week as they responded to Trump\u2019s tariffs. The skirmish began on Wednesday, when Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer offered a nuanced criticism of the trade war. She said she understood \u201cthe motivation behind the tariffs,\u201d but that \u201cyou can\u2019t just pull out the tariff hammer and swing at every problem without a clear, defined end goal.\u201d When asked how she would have enacted them differently, though, she said \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about that.\u201d Now, sure: The politics of trade are sensitive in a state like Michigan. But since she is a prospective 2028 candidate, potential Democratic primary opponents took the opportunity to differentiate themselves. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2014who also represents a state hit hard by free trade agreements\u2014 gave a much more blunt critique of the tariffs, accusing Trump of \u201cthreatening economic calamity,\u201d \u201cupending world markets,\u201d \u201charming seniors\u201d and \u201cisolating America in the world.\u201d Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called the tariffs \u201cTrump\u2019s Tax on Working Families.\u201d And Colorado Gov. Jared Polis responded directly to Whitmer, posting that \u201cthe \u2018tariff hammer\u2019 winds up hitting your own hand rather than the nail.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the only punishment Whitmer endured this week, though. She also met Trump in D.C. and was roped into an Oval Office press conference where Trump said she\u2019d \u201creally done an excellent job.\u201d Then Trump proceeded to sign a few authoritarian executive orders, forcing Whitmer to issue a clarifying statement saying that she had no idea that was going to happen. About those executive orders \u2026 Advertisement 7. Chris Krebs Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The executive orders are not getting more sane!

Except, Maybe, for the Most Unlikely One of All. This Content is Available for Slate Plus members only Trump\u2019s Tariff Chaos Could Give Him a Surprising Problem at the Supreme Court We\u2019re going to start with a very low bar here. At least President Trump\u2019s most egregious, strongman-like executive orders seeking retribution have been targeting institutions. You know, universities, Big Law, what have you. Not anymore! Now he\u2019s now going directly after individuals. On Wednesday, he released two executive orders \u201caddressing risks\u201d against Trump 1\u2013era officials who disobeyed him. The first is against Chris Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, whom Trump fired following the 2020 election for assuring the public that it was conducted securely. \u201cKrebs, through CISA, falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen,\u201d this actual memorandum from the president reads. The order doesn\u2019t just strip Krebs of any security clearances (child\u2019s play). It calls on the attorney general and homeland security secretaries to investigate him and report their findings to the president. A similar order was issued against Miles Taylor, the former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff who wrote a much-discussed anonymous column for the New York Times in 2018 titled \u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.\u201d On the law-firm front, even those decrees are getting more baseless\u2014and why not? It\u2019s working! \u2014as Trump issued new sanctions on the firm that represented Dominion Voting Systems in its successful legal action against the muppets who defamed them. He also signed another order \u201cMaintaining Acceptable Water Pressure in Showerheads,\u201d which is probably a lot better. Or it\u2019s bad. We don\u2019t know\u2014he signed a lot of executive orders this week to distract from how he had collapsed the economy. Get the best of news and politics Sign up for Slate\u2019s evening newsletter.
