Photo: Andrew Harnik/Getty Images The president of the United States recently praised Hannibal Lecter for helping him win reelection, suggested he was \u201c purposely \u201d crashing the economy, and then abruptly paused most of his tariffs, which he described as both up for negotiation and \u201c permanent .\u201d So you might think making zany and contradictory public declarations isn\u2019t the kind of thing that bothers members of Donald Trump \u2019s second administration. But Howard Lutnick found a way. Recent reporting on the Commerce secretary reads like a Politico cover of \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d Last month, the outlet reported that both White House officials and Trump\u2019s outside allies have grown \u201cincreasingly frustrated\u201d with Lutnick due to his attempts to ingratiate himself with the president, his tendency to give terrible policy advice, and his \u201cabrasive personality.\u201d One Politico source accused Lutnick of \u201ctrying to be a mini-Trump,\u201d while another described him as \u201ca new voice at the table pushing crazy shit,\u201d adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone that isn\u2019t pissed off at him.\u201d Lutnick\u2019s frequent, often embarrassing public statements are only making matters worse. The secretary has announced policies that Trump has yet to approve and made various jaw-dropping claims, like when he suggested Americans are eager to serve in \u201cthe army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones.\u201d Lutnick\u2019s media appearances \u201chave proven so challenging to White House officials that he was asked to curb them\u201d back in March, according to the Wall Street Journal . Nevertheless, Lutnick was the most prominent cheerleader for Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs and he\u2019s continued to be a font of darkly hilarious sycophancy in both his on-air appearances and his fawning social media posts. Here\u2019s a running list of Lutnick\u2019s most lunkheaded public statements. . Lutnick promises \u201cno recession in America\u201d During a March 9 appearance on Meet the Press , Lutnick said we should \u201cabsolutely not\u201d brace for an economic downturn as \u201cthere\u2019s going to be no recession in America.\u201d He went on to promise that Trump would \u201cgrow our economy in a way we\u2019ve never grown before,\u201d adding, \u201cif Donald Trump is bringing growth to America, I would never bet on recession, no chance.\u201d Howard Lutnick: \"There's going to be no recession in America\" \"Global tariffs are going to come down\" pic.twitter.com/3jhuTNd0pa \u2014 Aaron Bennett (@AaronDBennett) March 9, 2025 But Trump was way less confident, or at least less willing to make a potentially humiliating declaration on camera. That same day, the president declined to rule out a recession on Fox Sunday Morning Futures , saying \u201cI hate to predict things like that.\u201d . Lutnick admits there may be a recession \u2014 but it will be \u201cworth it\u201d Days later, CBS News asked Lutnick if Trump\u2019s tariffs are justified even if they spark a recession. \u201cThis policies are the most important thing America has ever had,\u201d the secretary answered, passionately, adding, \u201cIt is worth it.\u201d Q: \"Will these policies be worth it if they lead to a recession, even a short-term recession?\" Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick: \"These policies are the most important thing America has ever had.\" Q: \"So it is worth it?\" Lutnick: \"It is worth it.\" pic.twitter.com/yC9ooJ07e5 \u2014 The Bulwark (@BulwarkOnline) March 12, 2025 Lutnick quickly added that he doesn\u2019t think there will be a recession. And if there is , it won\u2019t be caused by the current president but \u201cthe Biden nonsense that we had to live with.\u201d Then the Commerce secretary insisted that the tariffs \u2014 which Trump would later implement only to delay less than a week later \u2014 weren\u2019t tumultuous at all. \u201cIt is not chaotic and the only one who thinks it\u2019s chaotic is someone who\u2019s being silly,\u201d Lutnick said. . Lutnick announces no taxes for people earning under $150,000 In the same \u201crecession is worth it\u201d interview, Lutnick told CBS that Trump is looking to abolish taxes for a huge swath of Americans. \u201cI know what his goal is: No tax for anybody who makes less than $150,000 a year. That\u2019s his goal. That\u2019s what I\u2019m working for,\u201d he said. Big if true! Which, as it turns out, it wasn\u2019t. He later clarified in a Fox News appearance, \u201cthat\u2019s aspirational.\u201d MacCallum: You said on CBS that Trump wants no taxes on people making below $150,000 Lutnick: That's taking it out of context\u2026 That's aspirational that when we balance the budget\u2026 pic.twitter.com/idWnvKmA4J \u2014 Acyn (@Acyn) March 13, 2025 . Lutnick urges Fox viewers to buy Tesla stock During a March 19 appearance on Fox News, Lutnick praised Elon Musk extensively and said viewers should buy stock in his car company. \u201cI think, if you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that this guy\u2019s stock is this cheap. It\u2019ll never be this cheap again.\u201d On Jesse Watters\u2019 show, Howard Lutnick, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, who served as the chairman and CEO of a major financial services firm for 34 years, tells viewers they should buy Tesla stock. \u201cI think if you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla.

Is that sort of thing frowned upon? . Lutnick claims only \u201cfraudsters\u201d worry about missing Social Security checks During a March 23 appearance on the All-In podcast, Lutnick claimed that most seniors wouldn\u2019t complain if their Social Security check didn\u2019t show up \u2014 and if they did, that\u2019s a sign that they\u2019re a \u201cfraudster.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s say Social Security didn\u2019t send out their checks this month. My mother-in-law, who\u2019s 94, she wouldn\u2019t call and complain,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cShe just wouldn\u2019t. She\u2019d think something got messed up, and she\u2019ll get it next month. A fraudster always makes the loudest noise, screaming, yelling, and complaining,\u201d Howard Lutnick: \"Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month, my mother-in-law\u2014 who's 94\u2014 she wouldn't call and complain. She just wouldn't.\u201d @Ronxyz00 pic.twitter.com/POE7VTZdmk \u2014 The Intellectualist (@highbrow_nobrow) March 21, 2025 Lutnick is right: that particular 94-year-old woman probably wouldn\u2019t complain, as her son-in-law is a billionaire. But would the 40 percent of older Americans who rely solely on Social Security income say something about a missing check? Well, they\u2019d better not, unless they want to spark a fraud investigation. . Lutnick promises an employment boom (largely for robots) So how exactly is Trump\u2019s trade war going to create American jobs in a timely fashion when it takes years to build a factory? Robots! In an interview with Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters, Lutnick claimed that low-wage factory workers in foreign countries are going to be replaced by fancy robots in the good old U.S. of A. That may sound like robots are taking our jobs, but the secretary explained Americans are going to \u2026 fix the robots or something? Honestly, Lutnick\u2019s word salad was kind of hard to follow. But the bottom line is ROBOTS! Get excited! Commerce Secretary @HowardLutnick tells Primetime that robot manufacturing is going to revive the American workforce. pic.twitter.com/7jjai8dNFp \u2014 Jesse Watters (@JesseBWatters) April 4, 2025 . Lutnick dreams of electric American sheep When asked to provide details on the coming robot revolution on Face the Nation , Lutnick was hazy on whether that would actually come to pass, or Trump\u2019s trade deals would just create American sweat shops. \u201cWell, remember, the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little \u2013 little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be automated and great Americans \u2014 the tradecraft of America, is going to fix them, is going to work on them. They\u2019re going to be mechanics. There\u2019s going to be HVAC specialists. There\u2019s going to be electricians, the tradecraft of America.\u201d Lutnick: \"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones -- that kind of thing is going to come to America.\" pic.twitter.com/g9TqxGxLHs \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 6, 2025 . Lutnick gushes over \u201cone of the most extraordinary Truth posts\u201d You can laugh now, but someday we\u2019re going to see a \u201cRoom Where It Happens\u201d-style Broadway number about Lutnick and Bessent watching Trump wage a trade war via Truth Social. Scott Bessent and I sat with the President while he wrote one of the most extraordinary Truth posts of his Presidency. The world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction. pic.twitter.com/wNvg8NBnSR \u2014 Howard Lutnick (@howardlutnick) April 9, 2025 . Lutnick declares his commitment to \u201cexploding our economy\u201d Hey, at least he\u2019s honest! The Golden Age is coming.

Photo: Helen Li/The Intercept When Victor Alcala saw that the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, had the Department of Veterans Affairs in its crosshairs, he decided to set up a protest at his local Tesla dealership. On a rare rainy day in Los Angeles in mid-March, Alcala stood outside the Alhambra Tesla showroom holding a sign: \u201cDon\u2019t buy a Swastikar.\u201d Alcala, a social worker, interacts with older adults in his daily job. More than 56 million seniors receive Social Security benefit payments each month. For a long time, Republicans and Democrats saw the program as the \u201c third rail of politics,\u201d untouchable because of how many people were dependent on it. As part of DOGE\u2019s efforts under Elon Musk, more than 7,000 jobs in the Social Security Administration will be cut , which Alcala believes will create a negative ripple effect when it comes to caring for senior citizens. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with seniors for 25 years. And now that that agency is being hollowed out, we\u2019ll end up seeing missed payments and a total system collapse of Social Security. What happens to all those people that are on social security, that\u2019s their only form of income?\u201d Alcala told The Intercept. Most Read Trump Appears to Be Targeting Muslim and \u201cNon-White\u201d Students for Deportation Jonah Valdez How Much Did Congress Make Off Market Turmoil and Why\u2019re They Allowed to Make Anything at All? Matt Sledge Newsletter The Intercept The protesters\u2019 focal point, across age, race, class, and favored cause, is an abiding hatred of Musk By protesting in front of the Tesla showroom, he hoped that he could make a small dent in pushing back against the cuts, particularly impacting Musk, who is Tesla\u2019s largest shareholder. \u201cDOGE is an illegal organization. Since he\u2019s taken money out of our pockets, we\u2019re here to take money out of his pocket as well.\u201d Across the country, hundreds of thousands of people like Alcala have swarmed Tesla showrooms, standing outside weekly to protest Musk and DOGE\u2019s recent efforts to cut different government departments. They range from former public school teachers, to prospective young graduate students, to a 96-year-old woman who once lived under Nazi-occupied Netherlands. To date, DOGE has been linked to more than 280,000 federal job cuts , including at the Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services, U.S. Agency for International Development, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The protesters\u2019 focal point, across age, race, class, and favored cause, is an abiding hatred of Musk\u2014 who has quickly shifted from helpful hatchet man to albatross for Donald Trump. News outlets have reported that Musk may soon step down from his position with DOGE. Trump has increasingly seen the tech executive as a political liability , and Musk\u2019s 130-day status as a \u201c special government employee \u201d will soon expire in May or June. But Tesla\u2019s stock and branding may already have taken a more permanent hit. While Tesla\u2019s stock value already dipped over the past year due to weakening sales, Musk\u2019s recent political activities have also hurt the perceived value for shareholders. \u201cThe protests have worked dramatically well, scaring away consumers that even were considering Teslas,\u201d said Ross Gerber, the chief executive officer of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management in Santa Monica, California. Gerber said that his clients have been asking him to sell their shares of Tesla stock. \u201cIt\u2019s still the best EV and it\u2019s a great brand. But now, who wants to drive one?\u201d \u201cThe value of these protests is not just about people individually no longer buying Teslas. It\u2019s really about rebranding the whole and making it an \u2018untouchable\u2019 brand,\u201d said Aaron Vansintjan, a policy manager at Food Secure Canada and co-author of \u201cThe Sustainability Class: How to Take Back Our Future from Lifestyle Environmentalists.\u201d The Intercept spoke to a number of people at protests in Southern California, Massachusetts, and Virginia over the past month.

Why are you protesting Tesla? \u201cWe\u2019re here because we\u2019re concerned about the direction of this country. Elon Musk is the hatchet man for our current president. He is unelected, he\u2019s unaccountable, he\u2019s unsupervised, and he\u2019s just wreaking havoc with our country. We believe no one is coming to save us. The courts are glacial. Congress is locked down under Republicans. So, basically, it\u2019s up to the people. It\u2019s up to us to try to stop this thing that\u2019s happening in our country.

It was a part of USAID and was responsible for essentially providing lifesaving medication for over 20 million people around the world. Because of the various suspension states of USAID, if nothing is done, more people are going to die from this than the Holocaust. [ Editor\u2019s Note: Estimates vary on the potential impact of the USAID cuts, but 26 million fewer deaths from AIDS have been attributed to PEPFAR alone over the past 20 years .] About two years ago, I had the opportunity to visit Auschwitz in Poland, and I made this informal promise to myself that if anything like that ever happened again, I would try to do every single thing in my power to not make it happen again.

Why are you protesting Tesla? \u201cThe guy is a liar. He just lies, and he puts these lies out like the Democrats are bringing all these illegal aliens and they\u2019re getting Social Security. But you can\u2019t get Social Security in this country unless you have a Social Security card. And to have a Social Security card, you have to have proof of citizenship. So the people that are here illegally and paying into Social Security are not drawing Social Security when they retire. They don\u2019t get it. They\u2019re actually putting into the system and not the other. The Pentagon never passed an audit. The last one they took, they literally could only account for somewhere between 40 percent and 50 percent of their spending. Now, if you\u2019re serious about cutting waste and fraud, wouldn\u2019t you start at the one agency? Clearly they\u2019re not serious about actual waste and actual fraud.

Why are you protesting Tesla? \u201cI am really angry about what\u2019s happened, and I want to make my voice heard and be with other people that feel the same way. I work with direct care staff with adults with developmental disabilities. Cutting Social Security, cutting Health and Human Services, all of that is going to profoundly affect people\u2019s lives. And I think the way that it\u2019s happening is deeply disturbing. This is [some] people\u2019s only income and these kinds of cuts by people who have no understanding of the services that they\u2019re cutting are dangerous. The population that I serve are very scared about their health care and their food and really day-to-day needs, and in the long term, I\u2019m very concerned about funding for the services.\u201d JACOB AND RYAN Jacob, left, and Ryan hold protest signs at a rally outside of the Tesla showroom at the Prudential Center in Boston on March 29, 2025. Photo: Helen Li/The Intercept Jacob is an engineer and Ryan is a student and sustainability advocate. Why are you protesting Tesla? \u201cI\u2019ve been watching this sort of DOGE thing unfold and watching the power that Elon Musk reveals in the government, remembering that I never voted for him, and that nobody ever voted for him. Due process is really important. When somebody has power, it is important that it comes from the consent of the governed, rather than from some decree from an authoritarian controller. Being someone who\u2019s going to be going into physics and grad school, everything does affect me personally. I feel like our democracy is facing some really big challenges right now.\u201d \u2014 Jacob As a sustainability advocate, why are you protesting Tesla? \u201cI used to be a fan of the argument that you should buy a Tesla because, not just for the environmental benefits, but just because it\u2019s a better car. I didn\u2019t care. I wanted to see more people buying electric. But when I see the richest man in the world buying a spot in the government, using the wealth that he accumulated from having like a 50 percent share of the market in the U.S., I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201d \u2014 Ryan ELIA BEN-ARI Elia Ben-Ari holds a protest sign at a rally outside of the Tesla showroom in Arlington, Va., on April 1, 2025. Photo: Helen Li/The Intercept Elia is a retired science writer focused on cancer research. What DOGE cuts concern you the most? \u201cI\u2019m a former scientist and science journalist, and I worked for the National Institutes of Health for many years. I\u2019m really concerned about what\u2019s happening, what Trump and Musk are doing to science, to scientific research. Directors of institutes at NIH are being either put on administrative leave or told that they are being reassigned. These are people who have years of expertise and training in things like infectious disease research, and now for political reasons, they\u2019re essentially being forced out of their jobs, and funding for research is being cut, especially in HIV research, things like preventing transmission of HIV from mother to unborn child. Why would anybody want to stop supporting research in that area?

Sign up for the Surge , the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday. Welcome to this week\u2019s edition of the Surge, a newsletter about all things politics in the United States, a place that can now be considered an emerging market country. Hey, here\u2019s some news: Your money is gone, forever. It\u2019s called the \u201cArt of the Deal.\u201d At least we\u2019ve still got Medicaid for bare-bones health ca\u2014oops, maybe not? What a week for the American pocketbook. Democrats\u2019 crippling addiction to nuance, meanwhile, is preventing some of them from saying the very easy sentence \u201cTrump killed the economy.\u201d And for ulcer-related reasons, we\u2019re not even touching the court cases involving the Trump administration\u2019s arbitrary kidnappings\u2014read the Slate legal people for that. Much is going on. Can anyone\u2014or any \u2026 thing\u2014stop it? 1. The bond market If there\u2019s anything that can get through to Trump \u2026 Last week, Donald Trump set in place a tariff plan that, if carried through, would at least cause a recession and at most put an end to our American-led economic and international order. He then played golf four days in a row. (Respect.) He and his team didn\u2019t necessarily mind the stock market going down 10 or 15 percent\u2014supposedly that would be the temporary pain. The more worrisome sign came when the bond market began to careen off the edge. One particular red alert was how the yield on 10-year Treasurys was shooting directly up, when typically, they should be a safe haven for investors in bear markets. That\u2019s one of those existential signs that the rest of the world is thinking about moving on from you. Trump\u2019s advisers publicly denied that the bond market had anything to do with the Wednesday decision to issue a 90-day \u201cpause\u201d on reciprocal tariffs. Privately, though, they said that was exactly the reason for the climb-down, and Trump himself conceded that markets were getting a little too \u201cyippy\u201d for his taste. Unfortunately, we\u2019re afraid Trump needs to take another look at the bond market. Despite a one-day stock market rally after Trump\u2019s \u201cpause\u201d\u2014which still left tariffs at their highest levels in 100 years\u2014everything resumed crashing by Thursday, with stocks and the dollar down and Treasury yields skyrocketing back up. This is the financial equivalent of someone (in this case, all other countries) breaking up with you via text. We know what we did. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement 2. Scott Bessent This goes well beyond positive reinforcement. We\u2019re still shocked by the spin that Bessent and these other dorks have been issuing since the \u201cpause\u201d to claim that everything is going according to plan. What really happened here is that Trump, who thinks that tariffs are a direct tax that the U.S. puts on other countries, did something impossibly reckless, because he could, and then had to begin walking it back. But his deputies have been tasked with conveying these actions as if he had just played the world. \u201cNo one creates leverage for himself like POTUS,\u201d Bessent posted. Commerce Secretary Howard \u201cGood Times\u201d Lutnick, sharing a screenshot of Trump\u2019s Truth Social post announcing the pause, wrote about how he and Bessent sat beside Trump as he drafted \u201cone of the most extraordinary Truth posts of his Presidency.\u201d White House policy chief Stephen Miller wrote that \u201cyou have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history.\u201d The only thing more head-spinning than some of these lines is that there\u2019s an audience that will believe it. 3. Mike Johnson Never a doubt. It was the House\u2019s turn this week to pass the compromise budget blueprint that the Senate passed last week, providing the skeletal structure for\u2014and finally allowing them to start real work on\u2014Trump\u2019s \u201cone big, beautiful bill.\u201d To recap, the \u201ccompromise\u201d that GOP leaders of both chambers struck was that they will make the difficult decisions later: The House would write a bill with bigger spending cuts, the Senate would write a bill with fewer, and they\u2019d come to some icky agreement irritating everyone in the end. (This could take several more months.) House conservatives, though, didn\u2019t like this. They wanted to straitjacket the Senate into big spending cuts now. And so we had another situation this week in which 10 or 20 House conservatives said they would never, ever, ever vote for this blueprint. The ins and outs weren\u2019t really worth paying attention to, because the holdouts\u2019 posture presented three options: First, they could\u2019ve voted to kill the blueprint, and with it, Trump\u2019s agenda (they didn\u2019t). Second, they could\u2019ve tried to negotiate again with the Senate on the blueprint, reopening talks on this never-ending first step just before both chambers went into a two-week recess (they would never). Third, the House conservatives could claim they got some \u201cassurances\u201d\u2014say, the speaker putting his job on the line \u2014about how spending cuts would definitely come later, vote to move the process along, and avoid Trump\u2019s wrath. That last option was always the only plausible one. The House passed the blueprint Thursday morning. Now it\u2019s time for them to write the bill. Plus vulnerable House Republicans have locked themselves into voting for a bill with hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts! Wishing everyone a good time. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement 4. Elon Musk and Peter Navarro The grand debates of towering statesmen. We haven\u2019t heard much from Elon Musk of late. That\u2019s partially because of how in the previous week, he made a Wisconsin judicial election a referendum on himself and biffed it. The day after that election, though, was \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d and the silence of Musk\u2014the richest businessman in history, whose companies do a lot of international commerce\u2014was revealing. It also didn\u2019t last. Before long, Musk was sniping on social media at Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s top trade adviser and the devil on Trump\u2019s shoulder urging on aggressive tariffs. He posted early last Saturday that Navarro\u2019s Ph.D. from Harvard was \u201ca bad thing, not a good thing,\u201d and that Navarro \u201cain\u2019t built shit.\u201d Navarro responded in an interview a couple of days later that Musk was merely a \u201ccar assembler,\u201d not a manufacturer, who imported Tesla parts from around the world. That really set Musk off. He called Navarro a \u201cmoron\u201d and \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks.\u201d In the latter post, he tagged the account \u201c@IfindRetards,\u201d and ultimately, he referred to Navarro as \u201cPeter Retarrdo.\u201d All very interesting stuff. It\u2019s worth emphasizing that these are two of the closest advisers to the president of the United States. Advertisement 5. Ken Paxton A big, expensive, stupid primary. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a MAGA showman who led a lawsuit to overturn the 2020 election and had also been impeached, though not convicted, by the state Legislature after nearly a decade of criminal investigations, announced a long-awaited primary challenge to Sen. John Cornyn this week. The dynamic is simple enough to understand: Paxton sees an opening to outflank Cornyn on craziness, as Cornyn is a normal human being who occasionally works to pass bipartisan legislation or expresses disapproval of some of Trump\u2019s actions. The two don\u2019t hide their despair of each other. Cornyn this week described Paxton as \u201ca con man and a fraud,\u201d and added that \u201cI am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him.\u201d The only thing motivating Paxton, Cornyn said, is \u201cvanity and personal ambition.\u201d This primary is going to be expensive and nasty at every turn. Regrettably, it\u2019s also going to force Cornyn, the sort of GOP senator you\u2019d like to have as even a modest check on Trump here or there, to behave like a caveman for the next year. Exhibit A: In March, Cornyn posted a photo of himself pretending to read The Art of the Deal in the kitchen with the caption \u201cRecommended.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement 6. Gretchen Whitmer A big, expensive, stupid primary. The adorable Democrats who still think there\u2019s going to be a presidential election in 2028 for them to run in were circling each other this week as they responded to Trump\u2019s tariffs. The skirmish began on Wednesday, when Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer offered a nuanced criticism of the trade war. She said she understood \u201cthe motivation behind the tariffs,\u201d but that \u201cyou can\u2019t just pull out the tariff hammer and swing at every problem without a clear, defined end goal.\u201d When asked how she would have enacted them differently, though, she said \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about that.\u201d Now, sure: The politics of trade are sensitive in a state like Michigan. But since she is a prospective 2028 candidate, potential Democratic primary opponents took the opportunity to differentiate themselves. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2014who also represents a state hit hard by free trade agreements\u2014 gave a much more blunt critique of the tariffs, accusing Trump of \u201cthreatening economic calamity,\u201d \u201cupending world markets,\u201d \u201charming seniors\u201d and \u201cisolating America in the world.\u201d Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called the tariffs \u201cTrump\u2019s Tax on Working Families.\u201d And Colorado Gov. Jared Polis responded directly to Whitmer, posting that \u201cthe \u2018tariff hammer\u2019 winds up hitting your own hand rather than the nail.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the only punishment Whitmer endured this week, though. She also met Trump in D.C. and was roped into an Oval Office press conference where Trump said she\u2019d \u201creally done an excellent job.\u201d Then Trump proceeded to sign a few authoritarian executive orders, forcing Whitmer to issue a clarifying statement saying that she had no idea that was going to happen. About those executive orders \u2026 Advertisement 7. Chris Krebs Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The executive orders are not getting more sane!

This Content is Available for Slate Plus members only Trump\u2019s Tariff Chaos Could Give Him a Surprising Problem at the Supreme Court We\u2019re going to start with a very low bar here. At least President Trump\u2019s most egregious, strongman-like executive orders seeking retribution have been targeting institutions. You know, universities, Big Law, what have you. Not anymore! Now he\u2019s now going directly after individuals. On Wednesday, he released two executive orders \u201caddressing risks\u201d against Trump 1\u2013era officials who disobeyed him. The first is against Chris Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, whom Trump fired following the 2020 election for assuring the public that it was conducted securely. \u201cKrebs, through CISA, falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen,\u201d this actual memorandum from the president reads. The order doesn\u2019t just strip Krebs of any security clearances (child\u2019s play). It calls on the attorney general and homeland security secretaries to investigate him and report their findings to the president. A similar order was issued against Miles Taylor, the former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff who wrote a much-discussed anonymous column for the New York Times in 2018 titled \u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.\u201d On the law-firm front, even those decrees are getting more baseless\u2014and why not? It\u2019s working! \u2014as Trump issued new sanctions on the firm that represented Dominion Voting Systems in its successful legal action against the muppets who defamed them. He also signed another order \u201cMaintaining Acceptable Water Pressure in Showerheads,\u201d which is probably a lot better. Or it\u2019s bad. We don\u2019t know\u2014he signed a lot of executive orders this week to distract from how he had collapsed the economy. Get the best of news and politics Sign up for Slate\u2019s evening newsletter.

Speaking with visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in Beijing on Friday, the Chinese leader said his nation was confident, self-reliant and \"not afraid\" of getting engaged in a trade war with America. He said Beijing will never back down when the Chinese nation is faced with the \"unreasonable\" demands of the Trump administration. However, he added, \"There are no winners in a trade war, and going against the world will only lead to self-isolation.\" The comments come as US President Donald Trump temporarily froze many tariffs for 90 days but imposed 145 percent tariffs on Chinese goods on Thursday. Consequently, global financial markets plummeted on trade jitters among investors. \"For over 70 years, China's development has relied on self-reliance and hard work \u2014 never on handouts from others, and it is not afraid of any unjust suppression,\" Xi said. \"Regardless of how the external environment changes, China will remain confident, stay focused, and concentrate on managing its own affairs well,\" he added. Xi called on the Brussels leadership to join Beijing in resisting \"unilateral bullying\" by the Trump administration. His comments to Sanchez, indicating Beijing's preference to expand cooperation with the EU, come amid escalating tensions with the United States. Meanwhile, European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen told the Financial Times that it remained armed with a \"wide range of countermeasures\" if negotiations with Trump hit the skids. \"An example is you could put a levy on the advertising revenues of digital services,\" applying across the bloc, she said. Legendary New York investor Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, said investors have been left with \"an element of trauma or shock or fear\" after all the global markets turmoil this week. \"It dramatically affected psychology and attitude about the United States' reliability,\" he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Top adviser to Trump, Elon Musk, even expressed doubts about the tariff war, which he has said would drive up costs for Tesla, his electric automaker. \"I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally in my view to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,\" Musk said in a video conference with Italian politicians. On Sunday, Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro said that Musk \"doesn't understand\" the situation. Musk fired back, calling Navarro a \"moron\". Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social on Wednesday that it's a \"Great time to buy\" stocks. Shortly after, the S&P 500 fell 3.5 percent as fears grew that the worsening trade war with China would crimp growth.

Tesla owners are being urged to take precautions to protect themselves amid a recent spate of vandalism against the vehicles across the United States. Since President Donald Trump took office in January and appointed Tesla owner Elon Musk to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), radical activists nationwide have taken their anger out on Tesla dealerships, collision centers, charging stations and privately-owned Teslas alike. Despite the fact that every Tesla vehicle is equipped with surveillance cameras, which the vehicle manufacturer calls Sentry Mode, unmitigated Tesla vandalism continues to grow. However, Attorney General Pam Bondi has already slapped four people with federal charges in fiery attacks on Tesla dealerships and charging stations.

During that time, police used decoy trains to catch graffiti vandals, and O'Donnell suggested that Tesla could partner with law enforcement and do something similar to catch and deter would-be vandals. \"[Radical activists] lost all sense of reality and reasoning,\" he said. \"And that might be a bigger issue, that politics has brought us to this point. And I've talked about this since the election. Democrats are really leaderless. They don't have a message. They're basically listening to whoever has the loudest megaphone.
