The Democrats provide legal support to the rioters, beginning with bailing them out if they are arrested. When Democrats riot, the mainstream media propagandists claim that they are exercising their rights as citizens, and even violence is whitewashed . However, if Trump supporters protest against an unfair election, they are branded as insurrectionists, and the protestors are targeted by government agencies, the way that dissenters are targeted in totalitarian regimes. There were no major protests or violence from the Democrats since Trump when re-elected last November. In the Aeneid , set during the Trojan War , the Trojan priest, Laoco\u00f6n, warns against the Trojan Horse gifted by the Greeks, with the famous words \" Time\u014d Dana\u014ds et d\u014dna ferent\u0113s \" , i.e., \"I fear the Greeks even when they bear gifts .\" The display of Democrat restraint is aimed at deceiving the public into thinking that they accepted the vox populi and are open-minded about President Trump. The plan is to claim that with the action, Trump went too far, hence they have no choice but to \u201cprotest.\u201d When DOGE began exposing government excesses, the Democrats thought they found their cause. In February, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) led a ' protest' demanding the revocation of Musk's access to Treasury Department databases. The 'protest' was powered by left-wing extremist bodies such as MoveOn Civic Action, Indivisible, and the Working Families Party. The Treasury Department responded that Musk has 'read-only' access to financial information, which is essential for DOGE's analysis and recommendations. Compulsive attention seekers and 'socialists' Bernie Sanders and AOC launched their ' Fighting Oligarchy ' tour the day Trump was elected, and they began 'rallies' in February. Since March, Tesla dealerships have been targeted. The AP reported that the most violent attacks occurred in left-leaning cities such as Colorado , Portland, Oregon , and Seattle. On April 5th, activists across the country protested during the Hands Off! movement that demanded the removal of Trump and Musk. This was powered by a consortium of left-wing groups, with MoveOn at the forefront. A few days back, Joe Biden tried to attack President Trump, but as always, had problems mustering words. He was ridiculed for using an anachronistic racist term . None of these had any impact; Trump's approval ratings soared to new heights. The latest Democrat ploy is to have their insurgents invade town halls led by GOP lawmakers. ABC News reported the following: \"Many in Grassley's audience in Iowa expressed concerns over the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to comply with court orders to facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from a prison in El Salvador, arguing Grassley and Congress haven\u2019t adequately provided checks and balances on the Trump administration, allowing him to defy court orders. \u201cYou going to bring that guy back from El Salvador?\u201d an audience member shouted. \u201cThat\u2019s not a power of Congress,\u201d Grassley responded. \u201cEl Salvador is an independent country\u2026 The president of that country is not subject to our U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d he added later. You could hear a loud groan from a woman before a man yelled, \u201cI\u2019m pissed!\u201d Another audience member asked, \u201cWe would like to know what you, as the people, the Congress, who are supposed to rein in this dictator, what are you going to do about these people who have been sentenced to life imprisonment in a foreign country with no due process?\u201d Another attendee pressed Grassley on whether he would take action to ensure the United States better follows international law and upholds \u201cthe ideals of our country to be a place of hope for others.\u201d Bill O'Reilly revealed that the 'protestors' were organized by Lee County Democrat activists in Iowa. Next was the town hall with Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene in a county won by Kamala Harris, where matters were much worse. When Green took the stage , a man attempting to charge at her was restrained and dragged out by police officers. Within moments, another individual shouted at Greene. Greene ordered him to leave, and he exited, trailed by an officer. Moments later, another man was tackled and dragged out by police. When he attempted to reenter, officers tased him. Many others engaged in similar behavior. The Acworth Police Department stated that the disruptors \"created an imminent public safety threat for all in attendance.\" Bill O'Reilly revealed that the insurgents were Democrat activists who were bailed out by the Cobb County Democrat committee. So, how did the media report the Grassley and Green townhalls? CNN covered it as \"GOP Sen. Grassley faces frustrated Iowans at town hall.\" The NYT claimed that Grassley drew jeers from Iowans. Other Democrat propagandists such as the HuffPo , Newsweek , and NBC News also pushed the narrative of outraged Iowans confronting Grassley. Taxpayer-funded NPR whitewashed the violence of Democrat insurgents and claimed that the protester who was stun-gunned . A few weeks back, during a hearing, Taylor Green had challenged public funding for NPR. The WSJ and the NYT also pushed the same narrative. These Democrat-funded insurgents prevented genuine questions from voters at the town hall, which is ironic, since they claimed to be standing for Democracy. So what does one make of this? Georgians and Iowans must laud that their representatives are dedicating their Easter break to interact with voters. If the Democrats were astute, they would flood the town hall with questions about issues that affect regular people, such as the short-term impact of Trump's tariffs on the economy and the potential impact on citizens due to mistakes made by DOGE. Instead, they focused on international law, refugee rights, and an El Salvadoran national , once accused of domestic violence and deported for being a member of the deadly MS-13 gang. The disruptors also pushed the Democrat narratives of a constitutional crisis . Hence, they inadvertently revealed they were Democrat apparatchiks deployed to hijack the town halls. The aim behind the display is to drive the perception that the public is rising against Trump and that Trump voters are suffering from buyer's remorse. This is merely the beginning. The 50501 organization, funded by the Left, has scheduled nationwide 'protests' on April 19. Perhaps the pro-Trump media journalist can embark on a perilous mission to interview and expose these 'protestors', who are likely to be clueless about the issues, but turn up for free marijuana . In the coming weeks, matters could get uglier, and Trump supporters and administration officials could be targeted. Law enforcement must be empowered to do their job and protect innocent civilians, while the DoJ must ensure that suitable punishment is meted out to the rioters. There is a silver lining to this ghastly display. The Democrat-led \"protests\" are proof that the Trump administration is on the right course. Since being inaugurated, Donald Trump has renegotiated fair trade deals with other nations, secured the U.S. border, deported illegal aliens, protected children from gender-altering procedures, brought back hostages from abroad and astronauts stranded in space, targeted gratuitous DEI initiatives, controlled inflation , boosted American energy independence, secured commitments to bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S., drained the swamp, pursued peace, embarrassed Democrat governors, and much more. Trump is defending American interests, and this is what enrages Democrats.

The IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington highlight worries about U.S. isolationism. China is expected to ease monetary policy, while U.S. earnings reports, including Tesla and Alphabet, will reveal tariff impacts. ETMarkets.com Global markets are on edge as they await China's response to U.S. tariffs, with potential monetary easing on the horizon. As financial markets try to move past tariff fears, attention turns to what China will do to buffer its economy and how corporate America and business activity globally is holding up. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank Spring meetings take place in Washington meanwhile against a backdrop of increased concern about U.S. isolationism. Here's the low-down on the week ahead in world markets from Rae Wee in Singapore, Lewis Krauskopf in New York and Dhara Ranasinghe, Yoruk Bahceli and Karin Strohecker in London. 1. HUNKERING DOWN China sets its benchmark lending rates on Monday at a time when investors are bracing for more monetary easing from Beijing to help offset the headwinds from hefty U.S. tariffs on the world's second-largest economy. Some analysts expect a reduction in one-year and five-year loan prime rates, which would mark the People's Bank of China's first cut since October last year. Tariffs between the United States and China now stand at eye-watering levels of more than 100% and some banks are already cutting their China growth forecasts in a sign of the toll the trade war is expected to take. Elsewhere in Asia, Bank Indonesia meets on Wednesday and policymakers are straddling a fine line as they weigh a darkening economic outlook against a rupiah that's pinned near record lows. Live Events 2. NOT SO MAGNIFICENT? A slew of quarterly earnings in the coming week led by Tesla and Alphabet could shed greater light on how U.S. companies are wrestling with a shifting trade landscape. Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker and Google parent Alphabet are the first of the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies to report quarterly results, with the megacap growth stocks under pressure. AI-related spending will be another focus, while Tesla, whose shares have been hit particularly hard in 2025, is also in the spotlight because of Musk's close ties to U.S. President Donald Trump. Investors will look for any insight from executives into the fallout from tariffs, with reports slated from major companies including 3M, Boeing, IBM , Merck, Intel, and Procter & Gamble . United Airlines on Tuesday warned of downside risks to its financial outlook if the U.S. economy slips into a recession -- one sign of the challenges facing companies. 3. PRICE RISK Wednesday's April flash PMIs should also give markets a sense of the first hit from Trump's tariff chaos. Trump has postponed reciprocal tariffs, but a widespread 10% levy on imports remains. U.S. companies' input prices were already feeling the heat before the latest measures, Canada's services PMI had hit a five year low. Expect things to get worse. The key number to watch is the U.S. manufacturing PMI input prices index, what S&P Global, which compiles the data, dubs the first port of call for the inflationary impact of tariffs. It had already risen sharply to signal the fastest rate of input price rises for U.S. companies in almost two years in March. Traders expect at least three U.S. rate cuts this year, but some banks are sceptical that it can cut at all given inflation risks. 4. WASHINGTON CALLING Finance officials head to Washington for the IMF/World Bank Spring meetings - one of the biggest gatherings of such policy makers in the year. Jobs growth is a focus at the meeting. But there's no doubt trade tensions and a glum growth outlook will be in focus with finance ministers and central bank governors from around the world also jostling for face time with the Trump administration. The contours of how Trump sees Washington's future role in and cooperation with Bretton Woods institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank might also become clearer. Among the big set items is the Fund's global economic outlook to be released on Tuesday. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has already flagged that sweeping U.S. tariffs posed a \"significant risk\", appealing to Washington and its trading partners to work constructively to reduce tensions. 5. UNEASY An uneasy calm has descended on investors, hopeful that the worst of the tariff-induced turmoil has passed. Wall Street shares have recovered from more than one-year lows, corporate bond spreads have come back in (a little) and signs of dysfunction in the $29 trillion Treasury market have eased after a pause to hefty duties. Trump is considering modifying auto tariffs. But with confidence shaken, focus is fixed on Washington, especially since aggressive tariffs against China remain and growth fears persist. The dollar is still heading for its worst month since 2022 and global investors have slashed U.S. stock holdings by a record amount in the past two months, says BofA. Deutsche Bank reckons a sustained shift in foreign investor allocation could generate \"huge negative dollar flows\". Markets rarely move in a straight line but when a trend is set, it's hard to reverse quickly.

Investors are on edge, with recession odds rising and volatility remaining high. AP US stock market faces test due to trade policy changes. Investors are cautious after President Trump's tariff announcement. A heavy slate of U.S. company results in the coming week will test a stock market shaken by a U.S. trade policy overhaul that upended the outlook for the global economy and corporate America. Investors remain on edge after President Donald Trump's sweeping April 2 tariff announcement stunned markets and sparked some of the most volatile trading since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic five years ago. After rebounding somewhat last week, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index fell this week and was down 14% from its February record high. Volatility levels moderated from five-year peaks but remain elevated by historic measures. Tesla and Google parent Alphabet - two of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap companies whose shares have faltered after two years of stock leadership - are among those closely watched for financial results as investors seek guidance about the fallout from tariffs that are very much in flux. \"The view of the CEOs going forward has never been more important,\" said JJ Kinahan, CEO of IG North America and president of online broker Tastytrade. Live Events Companies and investors are grappling with a tariff landscape poised to keep shifting as the Trump administration negotiates with other countries. While he has paused some of the heftiest levies on imports, the U.S. is also locked in a trade battle with China, the world's second-largest economy. Economists polled by Reuters this week put odds of a recession in the next year at 45%, up from 25% last month. In one corporate report this week that caught the attention of investors, United Airlines laid out two scenarios for the year, including one warning of a significant hit to revenue and profit if there is a recession. United's dual forecast provided a type of \"roadmap\" by acknowledging and quantifying risks, said Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at Evercore ISI. \"Putting parameters on what may unfold is how stakeholders ... make decisions in an environment where traditional guidance is bound to be considered relatively unreliable,\" Emanuel said in a note on Thursday. Elon Musk's electric vehicle maker Tesla, which reports results on April 22, is in the spotlight in part because of the billionaire's close ties to Trump. Alphabet will be watched for any detail on advertising spending and capital expenses tied to artificial intelligence capacity, as investors scrutinize AI project costs. The company was dealt a setback on Thursday, when a judge ruled Google illegally dominates two markets for online advertising technology. All the Magnificent Seven megacap stocks are sharply lower in 2025, with Alphabet down about 20% and Tesla off 40%. The Magnificent Seven \"led everything to the upside,\" Kinahan said. \"If they can't continue to perform, I think it gives people a pause overall, especially as we're looking for footing after the last couple of weeks.\" Boeing 's results are also in focus, after China reportedly ordered its airlines not to take further deliveries of the planemaker's jets. IBM, Merck , Intel and Procter & Gamble are among the major U.S. companies set to post results in the coming week. Projections for U.S. profit growth have pulled back, with S&P 500 earnings estimated to rise 9.2% in 2025, down from the 14% gain estimated at the start of the year, according to LSEG IBES data. Investors are bracing for even greater contraction as companies report results and account more for the tariffs. The market's attention was also on the Federal Reserve , after Trump on Thursday said Fed Chair Jerome Powell's termination \"cannot come fast enough,\" while calling for the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates. A day earlier, Powell said the Fed would wait for more data on the economy's direction before changing rates. Investors will be hoping that the heart of earnings season can restore more calm to markets. The Cboe Volatility index , an options-based measure of investor anxiety, hit around 60 in the aftermath of Trump's tariff announcement, but has since pulled back to about 30. Still, that level is well above its long-term median level of 17.6, according to LSEG Datastream. Ayako Yoshioka, senior investment strategist at Wealth Enhancement, said the index would need to recede to the \"mid-teens in order to say maybe that volatility has subsided a little bit.\" If it stays around 30, Yoshioka said, \"it doesn't mean we're out of the woods.\" (You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel ) Read More News on Tesla US earnings week Boeing Alphabet Federal Reserve Intel S&P 500 earnings Merck stock market volatility tariff fallout (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news , stock tips , Budget 2025 , Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice , on ETMarkets .

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Tesla's expansive supply chain is rapidly becoming its Achilles heel, as manufacturing synergies spread across the globe on the basis of competitive advantage buckle under President Trump's tariff-laden cudgel. It was just last week when Tesla canceled its plans to ship parts for the Cybercab and the Semi to the US from China. Now, add the much-anticipated cheaper version of the Model Y to the EV giant's growing list of disrupted products. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Tesla has been working on a cheaper, sub-$35,000 model for a while now. Earlier this year, speculation was rife that the new model would take the shape of a hatchback and open a whole new TAM for the EV giant, while allowing it to better compete with BYD Dolphin and Volkswagen ID.3 in China. Related Story Elon Musk Says Your Tesla Will Drive From The Factory Floor To Your House \u201cThis Year,\u201d Joe Rogan Becomes A Fan Of FSD, But The Cybercab Has Now Hit A Tariff Roadblock Now, however, we've just received two tantalizing tidbits on this front. First, the new model is not a hatchback, but merely a stripped down version of the Model Y, offering slower acceleration, smaller battery packs, smaller screens, etc. Second, that cheaper model has now been delayed. It appears that $TSLA will delay the launch of its more affordable vehicles until end of 3Q. Our bigger concern is the story appears to confirm our fear that the new cheaper vehicles will be stripped down versions of M-Y and M-3 (slower 0-60, smaller batteries, cloth seats,\u2026 https://t.co/oVlEsu3CHF \u2014 Gary Black (@garyblack00) April 19, 2025 Of course, according to Future Fund's Gary Black, the cheaper Model Y will simply cannibalize volume from Tesla's higher-margin vehicles, and will not meaningfully add to the overall sales momentum. It is for this reason that we feel the delay of the cheaper Model Y amid tariff-induced mayhem is probably a good thing for Tesla's bottom-line. Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, Tesla has also rescinded its plans to ship parts for the Cybercab and the Semi from China, citing stratospheric tariffs on Chinese imports as the raison d'\u00eatre. The EV giant was previously aiming to start trial production of the two models in October 2025, with mass production originally slated for 2026. The shipping halt, however, has complicated Tesla's production cadence at Texas and Nevada, home to the production lines for the Cybercab and the Semi, respectively. 1 minute before the close on Friday someone sold $2,500,000 worth of $TSLA calls This afternoon $TSLA delays its launch for its affordable Model Y until 2026 Its never been a better time to be an insider pic.twitter.com/FJYBE1zNRT \u2014 John Trades MBA (@JPATrades) April 18, 2025 Finally, we leave you with this delightful coincidence: someone is about to make a killing on Tesla's downward momentum come Monday.

Read Today's Paper Tesla to delay US launch of affordable EV, a lower-cost Model Y, reports SECTIONS Tesla to delay US launch of affordable EV, a lower-cost Model Y, reports Reuters Last Updated: Apr 19, 2025, 06:47:00 AM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Tesla's plan to launch a more affordable Model Y, internally named E41, faces delays in its U.S. production, now expected to begin months later than initially planned, potentially in the third quarter or early next year. The company aims to produce 250,000 units in the U.S. by 2026. Reuters Tesla's much-awaited plans for an affordable car include a stripped-down version of its best-selling electric SUV, the Model Y, that will be made in the United States, but the production launch has been delayed, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Tesla has promised affordable vehicles beginning in the first half of the year, offering a potential boost to flagging sales. Global production of the lower-cost Model Y, internally codenamed E41, is expected to begin in the United States, the sources said, but it would be at least months later than Tesla's public plan, they added, offering a range of revised targets from the third quarter to early next year. Two of the people said Tesla aimed to produce 250,000 of the cheaper Model Ys in the United States in 2026. The new vehicle is also planned for eventual production in China and Europe, Reuters has previously reported. The delay of U.S. production and the U.S. production target have not been previously reported. Tesla reports results on Tuesday, and plans for the new vehicles are a major question. The less expensive mass-market vehicles have been widely anticipated by Tesla fans and investors who hope they will attract a fresh group of customers and reverse the EV maker's falling sales and eroding market share. Tesla also has refreshed its original Model Y with exterior and interior changes. The Long Range All-Wheel Drive version in the United States costs about $49,000, before a $7,500 federal tax credit. Reuters reported last month that the China launch of the E41 will occur in 2026. The E41 will be smaller and cost 20% less to produce than the refreshed Model Y, the sources familiar with China plans told Reuters. The timing of the rollout in Europe is not clear. Live Events Tesla is also planning to launch a bare-bones version of its Model 3 compact sedan, three people said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the delay of production of the cheaper Model Y, production targets and other details reported here. The EV maker on Jan. 2 reported its first decline in annual deliveries last year, and analysts expect sales to fall again this year for several reasons, including damage to the brand reputation by Chief Executive Elon Musk's close work with U.S. President Donald Trump and support of far-right European politicians. Another challenge for Tesla is that its vehicles are aging and there is no relatively cheap model. Musk earlier promised a new, cheaper EV platform with cars expected to be priced as low as $25,000, but dropped that to prioritize robotaxi development. Automakers are grappling with prospects of rising prices and supply-chain disruption, after Trump imposed 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported from outside the United States. Tesla has increased North American sourcing for parts of many models over the last two years, which would decrease tariff exposure for the E41, two people aware of the matter said. It recently suspended plans to ship components from China to the United States for the Cybercab and Semi truck due to tariffs, one person told Reuters earlier this week.

OK so this is a big thing\u2026 Especially once you have a kid, OMG, last night I had like the worst headache and migraine of all time, the big issue being that we stayed out a bit too late, and didn\u2019t go to bed until 9 PM, which in Kids world is like at least two or three hours too late. I think actually, perhaps the best bedtime for kids is like 5 PM. Assuming that your kid gets out of school at like 2 PM, then the ideal thing is to go home, clean up shower up, eat some more random stuff, shower bathe and try to go to sleep as early as humanly possible. The reason why is that actually, no matter how disciplined you are, that time will always run like two or three hours late. I think this happens with almost everything in life, with money finances and planning\u2026 I\u2019m starting to think that like maybe, the wise idea is to set like an insanely huge buffer for everything, always anticipating the worst. For example, there is no worse thing than the anxiety of being late somewhere? So always always always show up early, maybe try to show up like at least 30 minutes or 40 minutes early? Because when there are unanticipated things like the President of China coming down into town, and shutting down all the streets, at least you are prepared. Being, being more mobile nimble, skinnier? Thinner? So being here in Phnom Penh Cambodia, \ufffc\ufffc grab which is there Uber, there are like 1 billion tuck tucks running around which are these like mini motorcycle transport vehicles, which are insanely skinny, and will only cost you like a dollar to go anywhere. Now during peak traffic rush-hour\u2026 These things are a godsend. Why? Because in the worst of traffic, even having an insanely tiny edge like a few more inches of skinniness, you can skinny skinny skinny sneak through little tiny cracks, in order to get by the traffic. But assuming you have a truck an SUV, a car, even a Prius\u2026 You\u2019re stuck. As a consequence, the hilarious irony is if you have like infinite wealth, nobody likes being stuck in traffic, not the rich not the poor, nobody. Certainly not kids. So when it comes to purchasing a vehicle, I might be the only one who thinks this but even if you\u2019re worth like $1 billion, you always always always always always want the skinniest car possible. Ford fiesta One car I surprisingly really loved was the Ford fiesta, I was part of this marketing campaign called the Ford fiesta movement, in which I got a suite electric blue Ford fiesta five speed manual car, while I was living in Michigan, and I was given free gas for like six months. What\u2019s actually super super insanely interesting is that this car, especially the Ford fiesta ST which I feel it looks like the most underrated car of all time, is that ultimately when shit hits the fan, the thing that you\u2019re always going to feel good about is being able to find a parking spot even in the midst of the worst Traffic conditions and in terms of space. So for example, even if you\u2019re a billionaire the best Tesla car is the smallest the skinniest, the closest to the round the most stable. This would be a Tesla model three performance, because typically with cars, the closer you are to the floor the more stable. And no no no don\u2019t get suckered by those stupid offloading people, It\u2019s like a very very expensive way to get a headache. I think it\u2019s actually much more interesting that you could instead, just go topless and in shorts, and just run through the mud, the rocks yourself and parkour around? Toyota? Also, with a Toyota car, similarly speaking the best Toyota car might also be the maximum small and skinny one. The same thing goes with Lexus. I\u2019m not sure, but I think maybe the smallest skinniest car is either the Prius or the Toyota Corolla. Assuming that they\u2019re the same size, Prius is obviously the better option because assuming you get a hybrid car, you\u2019re going to get at least 2X the MPG. And assuming that you\u2019re comparing a Corolla hybrid and a Prius hybrid, the reason why the Prius makes a lot more sense is because of the hatchback. With a hatchback you could fit like 1000 X more space stuff in the trunk and also ironically enough if you look at the two, the Prius actually looks a lot cooler than the Corolla? \ufffc The only other contender is the GR Corolla which I love and I think is insanely cool, but once again for practical purposes, you never ever ever want to be paying premium gas because you\u2019re going to have to pay it for the rest your life, even if America gets into a situation in which there is a embargo on oil \u2014 and if oil then became like $20 a gallon, you will be very very very happy that you had a Prius. And that you get like 50 MPG\u2018s, on regular cheap unleaded 87 gas, not 91 octane which is for suckers. And once again I think this is the hard thing for people to understand is that even if you\u2019re super super rich, technically the people who become super super rich or actually ironically the most frugal economical and penny conscious. Ident suppose the wisdom is knowing when to be frugal wisely but also knowing when to spend money wisely? It takes no skill to be a Scrooge, no wisdom to become a Scrooge. Because it is very very straightforward to penny you pinch every single penny, even if it might go to your disadvantage? For example, let us say you\u2019re trying to book a flight to Asia from LA. Let us say you have two options: a direct flight for $1000 which takes you 8 hours\ufffc, or a flight in which you have to connect three or four times, that takes 50 hours, that costs $800. \ufffcwhich option do you take? \ufffc of course you take the direct flight even though it cost $200 more\u2026 The difference between being in transit for eight hours versus 50 hours is pretty obvious. So there is some sort of economic calculus which is always happening, and I think the tricky thing is this economic stuff is not intuitive, rather, it is learned, indoctrinated, taught. My personal difficulty is that more or less, I came from nothing, I started from the bottom, and made it to the top. But so much of this was through my own bricolage (trial and error), personal experimentation and figuring things out. One of the greatest blessings in my life is actually meeting Cindy, because she essentially taught me financial literacy. When I first was living with her and dating her, I might have only had like 300 bucks in my savings account. Now I could purchase a garage full of Lamborghinis if I wanted to, but obviously will not because Lamborghinis are only for low testosterone losers . \ufffcHigh testosterone tall handsome demigods, with a body like Achilles, we all drive Prius\u2019s. \ufffc What is our real enemy? The way I see it, the only trend enemy here is media, television, the news, fake news real news, social media, iPhone notifications, etc. Even a thing which is making things 1000 times more messy is AI. For example, I\u2019ve been playing a lot with Grok and ChatGPT, I\u2019m kind of an expert in both, and what I\u2019ve discovered is AI becomes a strange self fulfilling prophecy. What that means is You train the AI on your blog and your data set, and then you use the AI to generate new text and information, using your voice and style, but then becomes a point in which AI doesn\u2019t know whether you wrote it or AI wrote it. As a consequence, You can\u2019t trust nothing. Only yourself. I\u2019ll give you an example, I\u2019ve been having a lot of fun having Grok and ChatGPT write blog articles and essays in my voice, simply because I\u2019m curious what it will produce. Thus for my lesson is that Grok, is a lot more fun and entertaining, in a surprising in a good way! I would say Grok is great for generating new creative ideas, ideas I would have not even thought of myself! For creative ideation, for coming out with new creative ideas\u2026 Grok is the best. ChatGPT is interesting because it\u2019s still the golden standard, and technically I think the better of the truth. Because it has been around for longer. With ChatGPT, the articles and information that produces is technically more accurate, but more bland and boring. None of the essays that ChatGPT has written in my voice has been entertaining to me. The funny thing is with Grok, all these essays that it writes, I think there\u2019s too much training that is done on Twitter X, so it\u2019s not really my voice it seems more like some sort of male meme person. For example he uses words that I have never used like \u201cHODL\u201d or \u201csats\u201d. \ufffc Even though I have been a bitcoin investor since 2018, I don\u2019t think I have ever used the word HODL (hold onto dear life\ufffc), or \u201csat\u201d (short for satoshi, the smallest denominator of a bitcoin\ufffc) or even Satoshi. \ufffc Also, my personal knowledge gaps. I know almost nothing about cold storage, keys, hardware wallet etc. Simply because I don\u2019t trust them. I also don\u2019t trust myself. The reason why I would prefer a custodian like Coinbase is because I feel much much more secure storing my Face ID or my thumbprint, rather than being the guy who forgot my keys and my password, locking myself out of $1 billion. Darney in the hilarious thing is that a lot of people, in order to get more security, simply end up locking out themselves? Like with Security, ironically I think the safest way to live is to not have security. For example, even NASSIM TALEB, at the height of his exposure to other economist in mainstream media, started to get anxiety that not even chamomile tea could get rid of. Therefore instead of hiring a bodyguard, she decided to look like a bodyguard himself, and this is where I first learned about one rep Max lifting, in which the style of weightlifting is rather than trying to do these hateful repetitions, much more mainly fun interesting and effective instead to simply hold up all of your strength to see, whether eucalypt a maximum weight, successful successfully once, rather than grind out like 100 boring repetitions. This is kind of a big deal because it\u2019s almost like bodybuilding truth 1 oh one that in order to get bigger hypertrophy, you have to do light repetitions, on to failure. For example, like the professional bodybuilder might try to dead lift 405 pounds like 20 times in a row, whereas a power lifter would prefer to lift 1000 pounds, once? Or, a bodybuilder might try to bench press 315 pounds 10 times, for 4 sets, while a power lifter might try to bench press 800 pounds, once? In terms of showmanship, there is nothing more entertaining to watch in real life than a power lifter tried to hype himself up before one repetition maximum he has actually never attempted before. Even for myself as a weightlifter, this is my supreme joy in life: to see, whether I will be successful or not? Or even having the balls to attempt it in the first place? My general idea in weightlifting is simple: if you already know with 100% searching before doing the lift that you will be successful, it is not worth doing. Even as Jeff Bezos says, thinking of himself like an inventor or a scientist, the idea is that with experiment, what a lot of these risk-averse individuals do not know is if you know with 100% certainty already that it will be successful, it is not an experiment. An experiment is having a gut predilection towards something \ufffc,,, something in which you have autotelic curiosity about, and something you want to attempt because you\u2019re genuinely curious, almost rather than the result? Like Donald Trump says: in the art of the deal \u201c I do it in order to do it \u201d. \ufffc Also for Donald Trump even said in the art of the deal, that he doesn\u2019t do it for the money but money in dollar bills is simply a way to keep score. Unrelated I totally unrelated thing, in the bit of all this tariff warfare, it suddenly came to my memory that Donald Trump, I think co-authored a book or wrote a book through the voice of a ghost writer, called the Art of the deal. I think the truth is he didn\u2019t actually write the book but had another guy write it for him \u2014 which makes sense because if you\u2019re a real business man, you don\u2019t actually have time to write books. Like for example ask Michael Saylor if he\u2019s going to write a book on bitcoin, but the truth is he cannot right now because he is simply too busy doing the real deal? And typically this is where it is wise to never read business books which are actually not written by the entrepreneur themselves because a commentator who isn\u2019t on the front lines will never know. Still today\u2026 I think the only business books worth reading are the biographies by Walter Isaacson, on Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Leonardo da Vinci etc., and also, zero to one by Peter Thiel. And then actually, more interesting than reading a book about a successful individual is interviews with the individuals themselves. For example, I really love the Joe Rogan interview interviews with Elon Musk because it is unfiltered, and, you get it straight from the source! Another thing to learn from is through people\u2018s physiology and demeanor. For example, for me a big concerning aspect about Elon Musk was how his physical health looked. I think in the most recent Joe Rogan podcast in which he is wearing the occupy Mars T-shirt, he looks really really obese and unwell? But anyways, super interesting random things that came to my attention is how great Elon Musk is that video games, that actually\u2026 I think in Diablo for his like ranked top 10 on the planet? And at one point maybe when he was in college\u2026 He was one of the top players in the states and thus the world? Keep, keeping your options open?

A \u2018minimum pricing\u2019 arrangement \u2013 also referred to as \u2018price floors\u2019 or \u2018price undertakings\u2019 \u2013 between the European Union (EU) and China would see tariffs abolished and set minimum prices agreed upon. According to Reuters, European trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic has said any new policy would have to be as effective as tariffs, given the approach has previously only been applied on \u2018homogenous commodities\u2019. The tariffs \u2013 which only apply to battery-electric vehicles and not Chinese-made hybrids or other cars \u2013 have not stopped the growth of Chinese brands in Europe, with sales increasing 64 per cent (across all models, not only electric) in February 2025 alone. Some of the cheapest electric cars on sale in the EU, even from European brands, are made in China and include the Citroen e-C3 and the Dacia Spring, neither of which are currently offered in Australia. Yet sales of Chinese-made electric cars did fall 3.4 percent in February, however, while European battery-electric vehicles sales increased 26 per cent. The return of the EU and China to the negotiating table last week was motivated by the need to respond to extraordinary tariffs between the United States (US) and China on all goods \u2013 including electric cars. While some concessions from the US have allegedly been made \u2013 such as on electronics, although this is not confirmed \u2013 the rapidly changing trade battle has not seen tariffs on vehicles reduced at the time of writing. The idea of minimum pricing was already being discussed as an alternative when the EU tariffs came into effect on October 31, 2024. The European Union (EU) Commission and Chinese officials discussed \u2018price commitments\u2019 to replace tariffs, according to Reuters reports at the time, with both looking for a mutually agreeable solution compatible with World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. The tariffs came after an EU investigation declared the Chinese auto industry a significant threat to Europe\u2019s car-making business, with state-support from the Chinese government enabling an \u2018unfair advantage\u2019. Each Chinese car manufacturer was asked to submit details on its level of government support, which would determine the tariff rate for each brand. Those who co-operated \u2013 and had less government support \u2013 like Tesla were given the lowest tariff, with the electric car maker given a 7.5 per cent rate. The maximum tariff was dished out to car makers who failed to cooperate when asked for details, such as SAIC Motor \u2013 the parent company of MG and LDV brands \u2013 which was given a 38.3 per cent tariff on top of the standard blanket 10 per cent. Geely \u2013 owner of Volvo, Polestar, Lotus and half-owner of Smart in partnership with Mercedes-Benz \u2013 was given a 20 per cent tariff, while Tesla rival BYD saw 17.4 per cent applied to its electric vehicles. Not all 27 member states voted in favour of the tariffs, with notable objections from Germany where Volkswagen faced closure of factories in its homeland for the first time in its history. Around one-third of Germany\u2019s annual auto exports \u2013 totalling 3.4 million last year \u2013 are sent to China, although its brands suffered dramatic falls in sales in late 2024. BYD is currently constructing a factory in Szeged, Hungary \u2013 which last month saw the EU launch an investigation into alleged \u2018unfair Chinese government subsidies\u201d, according to Reuters. Hungary also voted against the tariffs with BYD\u2019s investment announced in December 2023. Those in favour included France \u2013 where the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance is headquartered \u2013 and Italy, home of Stellantis group which includes Fiat, Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Jeep, Ram Trucks, Chrysler, Peugeot, Alpine and former General Motors brand and sister-company to Australia\u2019s Holden, Opel.

I've been reading car journals for years and what I've seen about Chinese EVs is spectacular. They are, in general, vastly cheaper than and far superior to Western, Japanese, and Korean models. BYD, the biggest maker (there are over 100 manufacturers in the country!), has an SUV, the Titanium, that is more advanced technologically than almost any competitor, and it sells for less than $20,000 US. Additionally, it's launching a megawatt charging system that can fully charge a car in FIVE minutes. At the high end, there are models like the NIO ET9 (check out the Car and Driver review) that run over $100,000 and stack up favorably against Rolls Royce and Mercedes-Maybach. As it is, the only Chinese manufactured cars in the US are the gas Volvo and the hybrid Polestar, neither particularly impressive. Other Chinese brands will probably never be available here, but I don't doubt that they will be successful in almost any market where they're allowed. 1 posted on 04/17/2025 9:00:15 PM PDT by Miami Rebel [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies ] To: Miami Rebel So instead of tariffs, it government sanctioned non-competitive agreements, with the purpose of giving a middle finger to Trump.

Ad Disclosure A top crypto asset manager has doubled up on its backing of Dogecoin, asserting the meme coin is more than a joke due to its provision of actual utility. The company recently pointed to Dogecoin\u2019s community orientation, speed of transactions, and low costs as important benefits in the cryptoverse. Related Reading: From Courtroom To Crypto: Semler Scientific Files To Buy $500-M In Bitcoin Speed And Low Costs Drive Everyday Use Cases According to 21Shares, Dogecoin processes blocks every minute \u2013 10 times the rate of Bitcoin. This rapid processing combined with low fees makes it particularly useful for making small payments and tips. The asset manager attributed these technical attributes as the reasons why firms such as Tesla, AMC Theatres, and Newegg now take Dogecoin as payment. Dogecoin has just been added by the Open House Group, one of the major real estate players listed on Japan\u2019s Tokyo Stock Exchange. Payments processor BitPay has also assisted thousands of global merchants in taking DOGE on everyday transactions. Source: 21Shares 10-Year Growth Reaches Staggering 130,000% Over the past decade, Dogecoin has seen its value climb by an eye-popping 130,000%, which breaks down to an annual growth rate of nearly 130%. These figures, reported by 21Shares, put DOGE at the top of the performance chart among the 25 largest cryptocurrencies by market value. Source: 21Shares Related Reading: Crypto Con Hits The High Office: Minister\u2019s X Account Hacked In contrast to Bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply, there is no ceiling on the total amount of Dogecoin in existence. 10,000 DOGE is added to the network every minute, producing roughly 5.25 billion new tokens annually. 21Shares contends this linear mining system has resulted in decreasing inflation rates over time while securing the network. Image: Vield Partnership And Dogecoin ETP 21Shares has gone from just applauding Dogecoin. The company recently partnered with House of Doge to list the first Dogecoin ETP (Exchange-Traded Product) to bear the Dogecoin Foundation\u2019s stamp of approval. The product offers institutional investors a regulated vehicle for wagering on Dogecoin\u2019s future without directly acquiring the cryptocurrency. The asset manager also submitted filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week for a possible Dogecoin ETF in the United States. They\u2019re not the only ones doing this\u2014companies like Grayscale and Bitwise have done the same to create Dogecoin ETFs. DOGE is currently trading at $0.15. Chart: TradingView Technical Indicators Suggest Potential Price Rise Meanwhile, traders looking at Dogecoin are watching closely the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 62.32, which indicates excellent buying pressure but not yet on the verge of overbought. Market observers point out the histogram has switched to positive and some short-term traders interpret that as a \u201cbuy\u201d sign. Although deep-pocketed investors are cautious, retail traders are eyeing the next resistance at $0.21. Piercing through that level could push DOGE to rise as high as $0.24 or even $0.29, technical analysts monitoring the performance of the cryptocurrency have disclosed. Under these trends, some market players anticipate Dogecoin\u2019s increasing trend to extend.

Political polarization, particularly that between young men and women, has become an internationally recognized phenomenon in recent years. One example from pop culture came last month when \u201cLove is Blind\u201d stars Sara Carton and Ben Mezzenga did not get married during the season finale because Carton had reservations about Mezzenga\u2019s religious and political viewpoints, including Black Lives Matter. Axios\u2019 Mimi Montgomery reported that political polarization is acutely felt in the Washington, D.C., area, as government officials and operatives of political parties look for love. \u201cIt\u2019s just so polarizing,\u201d DMV-based matchmaker Susan Trombetti told Axios. \u201cIt always has been, but it\u2019s on steroids now.\u201d One new aspect driving tension in the dating world is the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) laying off government workers in the Washington, D.C., area. A new fixture in many dating app bios, D.C. singles reportedly told Axios, is \u201cLaid off by DOGE.\u201d D.C.-based matchmaker Kat Markiewicz spoke about current polarization, noting that many clients quickly declare they will never date someone from the opposite political before she can even ask. The problem has worsened with the new administration, particularly with Tesla founder Elon Musk\u2019s involvement at DOGE. The rise in political polarization has been rising in recent years. Getty Images \u201cFour years ago, five years ago, I was hearing, \u2018Oh, I couldn\u2019t date a Trump supporter,'\u201d Markiewicz told Axios. \u201cNow it\u2019s like, \u2018I cannot date someone if they drive a Tesla.'\u201d OKCupid, a popular dating app known for analyzing trends among their users, gave Axios statistics confirming how the dating game has changed. DMV-based matchmaker Susan Trombetti told Axios that the Washington D.C. area has always felt polarizing but mentions, \u201cit\u2019s on steroids now.\u201d Getty Images The app\u2019s representatives claimed that before last summer, 45% of the app\u2019s users in D.C. said they wanted to match with a member of their own political party. That number rose to 51% after Trump was elected in November and then to 58% after Inauguration Day. Trump supporters are reportedly behaving differently now than they did during Trump\u2019s first term, too. \u201cDespite the tension, more Washingtonians are openly expressing their conservative views on dating apps, users tell Axios \u2014 a departure from Trump\u2019s first term, when some conservatives listed their political affiliation as \u2018moderate\u2019 in their bios,\u201d Axios\u2019 Montgomery said. One DC resident reported seeing numerous photos on dating apps of people posing with the president or appearing in his Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting how the new administration has allowed people to feel more open about what they believe in this city,\u201d she said.

Plaintiff Nyree Hinton claims his 2020 Model Y's odometer ran at least 15% fast, causing his 50,000-mile warranty to expire prematurely and leaving him with a $10,000 repair bill. Reuters Tesla faces a proposed class action claiming it speeds up odometers on its electric vehicles so they fall out of warranty faster, saving Elon Musk's company from having to pay for repairs. The plaintiff Nyree Hinton alleged that Tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and \"predictive algorithms\" rather than actual mileage driven. He said the odometer on the 2020 Model Y he bought in December 2022 with 36,772 miles on the clock ran at least 15% fast, based on his other vehicles and driving history, and for a while said he drove 72 miles a day when at most he drove 20. Hinton, a Los Angeles resident, said this caused his 50,000-mile basic warranty to expire well ahead of schedule, leaving him with a $10,000 suspension repair bill that he thought Tesla should cover. \"By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely,\" the complaint said. Live Events Tesla and its lawyer did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment, but have denied all material allegations in the lawsuit. The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office. Hinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show. Tesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city. The automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges. In March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action. The case is Hinton v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 25-02877.

What Happened : On Tuesday, Sanders posted on X a list of several major corporations and billionaires who, according to him, paid less in federal income taxes than an individual who paid just $1. The list included Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ), and Nike (NYSE: NKE ), as well as billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos . Sanders pointed out that these entities paid little to no federal income taxes in various years. For instance, Tesla paid zero federal income tax on $2.3 billion of U.S. income in 2024, as per ITEP data.

Sanders\u2019 post reflects his ongoing support for a wealth tax, suggesting a levy on the top 0.1% of earners\u2014those with a net worth above $32 million\u2014to generate $4.35 trillion over ten years for initiatives such as Medicare for All. Sanders\u2019 post comes amid a growing debate on wealth inequality and tax reform. He has been vocal about his concerns regarding the growing wealth gap in the U.S. and the need for tax reforms that do not favor the ultra-wealthy. In a previous statement, Sanders emphasized that programs for working families should not be sacrificed to provide tax breaks for billionaires.

Why It Matters : The Senator\u2019s call for tax reform also finds resonance with some of his ideological rivals. Recently, the Trump administration has reportedly been considering a tax increase for the wealthiest Americans, a move that Sanders has long advocated for. As the debate on tax reform continues, Sanders\u2019 post serves as a stark reminder of the tax inequities that exist and the need for reform. That being said, some X users were quick to point out that with a federal income tax payment of $11 billion in 2021, Elon Musk announced himself as the highest taxpayer in history. Story Continues Moreover, Kyle Pomerleau , a senior fellow at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute, explained the phenomenon. He said that low corporate tax rates show big corporations are simply trying to minimize their tax burden, just like everyday taxpayers do. \u201cThese low effective tax rates are not reflective of tax evasion,\u201d Pomerleau told USA Today previously. \u201cIt\u2019s tax avoidance.

The plaintiff Nyree Hinton alleged that Tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and \"predictive algorithms\" rather than actual mileage driven. In this article TSLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Tesla sign seen outside the Tesla showroom in downtown Chicago on April 15, 2025. Anadolu via Getty Images Tesla faces a proposed class action claiming it speeds up odometers on its electric vehicles so they fall out of warranty faster, saving Elon Musk's company from having to pay for repairs. The plaintiff Nyree Hinton alleged that Tesla odometer readings reflect energy consumption, driver behavior and \"predictive algorithms\" rather than actual mileage driven. He said the odometer on the 2020 Model Y he bought in December 2022 with 36,772 miles on the clock ran at least 15% fast, based on his other vehicles and driving history, and for a while said he drove 72 miles a day when at most he drove 20. Hinton, a Los Angeles resident, said this caused his 50,000-mile basic warranty to expire well ahead of schedule, leaving him with a $10,000 suspension repair bill that he thought Tesla should cover. \"By tying warranty limits and lease mileage caps to inflated 'odometer' readings, Tesla increases repair revenue, reduces warranty obligations, and compels consumers to purchase extended warranties prematurely,\" the complaint said. Tesla and its lawyer did not immediately respond on Thursday to requests for comment, but have denied all material allegations in the lawsuit. The Austin, Texas-based company does not have a media relations office. Hinton is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for Tesla drivers in California, potentially encompassing more than 1 million vehicles, court papers show. Tesla moved his lawsuit this month to Los Angeles federal court from a state court in that city. The automaker has also faced litigation accusing it of inflating vehicle driving ranges. In March 2024, a federal judge in Oakland, California said drivers in that case must pursue their claims in individual arbitrations, not a class action. The case is Hinton v Tesla Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 25-02877.", "sentiment": "NEGATIVE", "sentiment_score": -0.7, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/18/tesla-speeds-up-odometers-to-avoid-warranty-repairs-us-lawsuit-claims.html", "source": "CNBC", "published_at": "2025-04-18T01:08:20"}, {"id": 280, "title": "400 kW DC fast charging On The Run arrives in Canada \u2013\u00a0and it\u2019s FREE!", "content": "400 kW charging On The Run arrives in Canada \u2013 and it's FREE!

Jo Borr\u00e1s | Apr 17 2025 - 5:34 pm PT 44 Comments British Columbia got its first 400 kW DC fast charger last week at Canadian C-store chain On The Run, but that\u2019s not the good part. As part of a limited time offer, these chargers are FREE! The Canadian convenience store chain just took the wraps off its new, ABB-developed , 400 kW chargers earlier this month, but they\u2019re already planning to bring the ultra-fast 400 kW dispensers to at least four more locations in BC this spring, and have them online just in time for the summer road trip season \u2013 something On The Run hopes its customers will appreciate. \u201cThe A400 charger delivers an enhanced customer experience, with reliability and performance from a 32-inch screen to higher power charging sessions and power sharing,\u201d reads the company\u2019s official announcement, via LinkedIn. \u201cDownload the Journie Rewards app to start the charge \u2013 free for a limited time.\u201d On The Run\u2019s new 400 kW ABB DC fast chargers are compatible with CCS and CHAdeMO plugs, and can accommodate Tesla and other NACS-equipped vehicles with an adapter. That said, the company seems to imply that Tesla drivers in particular will have a maximum charging speed of \u201cjust\u201d 50 kW, which feel hilarious ( given the current state of affairs between Tesla and the Canadian government ), but probably isn\u2019t.

View all comments In addition to the ABB A400 400 kW units shown here, On The Run locations also employ the ABB Terra 184 dispensers rated at 180 kW. On The Run plans similar deployments at the four BC locations mentioned above, as well as two more each in Quebec and Ontario slated to go live towards the end of this year. Electrek\u2019s Take Tesla\u2019s controversial CEO Elon Musk once mocked 350 kW charging speed as being \u201c for a child\u2019s toy ,\u201d despite the fact that, nearly nine years later, his own cars and Superchargers can barely make it to 325 kW while others have sailed right on past. I made fun of that fact on the Quick Charge episode shown, above \u2013 and, while I do think it\u2019s funny and relevant, the much more relevant piece of news here is that companies like BP Pulse , Revel , and Wallbox are actively deploying 400 kW solutions, today ( while others hit the same mark as far back as 2017 ). It\u2019s just a fact: Tesla has fallen way behind. SOURCE | IMAGES : On The Run, via Electric Autonomy . Add Electrek to your Google News feed. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

There\u2019s a special kind of humility that comes from watching the world defy your certainty, especially in technology. What once seemed obvious fades, and what once seemed laughable becomes the new standard. I\u2019ve learned to treat bold predictions with skepticism, especially my own. Thankfully, I\u2019m in good company. The quotes below come from some of the brightest minds, most prominent institutions, and boldest publications of their time\u2014people who shaped industries and commanded respect. And yet, when it came to forecasting the future, they missed it\u2026 spectacularly. Here\u2019s a curated list of verified tech predictions that turned out to be hilariously wrong. Let it serve as a reminder: the future is always more surprising than we expect. The Americans have need of the telephone, but we do not. We have plenty of messenger boys. William Preece, Chief Engineer of the British Post Office, 1876 Preece made this statement to dismiss the necessity of the telephone in Britain, expressing confidence in existing communication systems, such as messenger boys. It has since become emblematic of institutional resistance to innovation. Computers in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons. Popular Mechanics, March 1949 Published in Popular Mechanics , this line was intended as a futuristic vision at a time when computers like ENIAC were 30-ton behemoths. Ironically, it\u2019s often quoted today as an example of underestimating future miniaturization. Remote shopping, while entirely feasible, will flop\u2014because women like to get out of the house, like to handle the merchandise, like to be able to change their minds. Time Magazine, Essay \u201cThe Futurists,\u201d 1966 This sexist projection failed to anticipate the convenience-driven adoption of e-commerce. The quote is now often cited as an example of how cultural assumptions can cloud predictions. There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home. Ken Olsen, Founder of Digital Equipment Corporation, World Future Society, 1977 Olsen made this statement, though it was taken out of context. He meant computers controlling the home, such as smart home systems, not personal computers. Regardless, it became infamous in tech lore. The idea of a personal communicator in every pocket is a pipe dream. Andrew Grove, Intel CEO, 1992 Andrew Grove expressed skepticism about the feasibility of personal communicators in every pocket, referring to them as a pipe dream driven by greed . This sentiment was documented in a 1992 article, reflecting the technological limitations and market uncertainties of the time The truth is no online database will replace your daily newspaper, no CD-ROM can take the place of a competent teacher and no computer network will change the way government works. Clifford Stoll, Newsweek, \u201cWhy the Web Won\u2019t Be Nirvana,\u201d February 27, 1995 This widely circulated quote was part of a more extended essay expressing skepticism about the internet\u2019s transformative power. Stoll later acknowledged he was wrong and has since become a good-natured example of forecasting humility. We\u2019ll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh, sure. Clifford Stoll, sarcastically quoting Nicholas Negroponte, Newsweek, 1995 Mocking Negroponte\u2019s accurate prediction, this quote was intended to ridicule the idea of online shopping. It has since become one of the most well-known examples of a futurist being right and a critic being spectacularly wrong. I predict the Internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse. Robert Metcalfe, InfoWorld, 1995 Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet, predicted an internet collapse due to bandwidth strain and poor infrastructure. When it didn\u2019t happen, he publicly ate his own words\u2014blending and drinking a printout of his column. The NeXT purchase is too little, too late. Apple is already dead. Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft Chief Technology Officer, June 1997 The quote, now infamous, came just before Apple\u2019s historic turnaround under Steve Jobs, proving how even seasoned tech leaders can badly misread the future. The iMac will only sell to some of the true believers. [It\u2019s] clean, elegant, floppy-free\u2014and doomed. The Boston Globe, May 14, 1998 Critics were alarmed by the iMac\u2019s lack of a floppy drive and its unconventional design. Apple\u2019s risk, however, paid off, and the iMac became a commercial success that helped reposition the company. The growth of the Internet will slow drastically, as the flaw in \u2018Metcalfe\u2019s law\u2019\u2026 becomes apparent: most people have nothing to say to each other! By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet\u2019s impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine\u2019s. Paul Krugman, Red Herring Magazine, 1998 Often cited in failed tech predictions, this quote captures a fundamental underestimation of how social and commercial connectivity would fuel the internet\u2019s expansion. Krugman later clarified that the quote wasn\u2019t meant to be definitive. [The Internet] may be just a passing fad as millions give up on it. Daily Mail, December 2000 This quote is from a Daily Mail article summarizing research from the UK\u2019s Virtual Society project. The headline turned out to be wildly off base, coming just before the widespread adoption of broadband and the explosion of digital life. Maybe I\u2019m an idiot, but I have no idea what anyone is talking about. What is it? It\u2019s complete gibberish. It\u2019s insane. When is this idiocy going to stop? Larry Ellison, Oracle CEO, Oracle OpenWorld, September 2008 At Oracle OpenWorld 2008, Ellison expressed skepticism about the emerging concept of cloud computing, criticizing it as a vague and overhyped term. Despite his initial dismissal, Oracle later embraced cloud technology, launching its own cloud services and becoming a significant player in the industry. You cannot develop serious portable applications on Android. Ray Lane, HP Chairman, September 2011 Following the discontinuation of HP\u2019s TouchPad, Ray Lane expressed skepticism about the Android platform\u2019s viability for developing robust portable applications. This statement was made during a period of uncertainty for HP\u2019s mobile strategy, and Lane\u2019s assessment reflected concerns about Android\u2019s capabilities at the time. Could it be, you know, four, five years? I think so. Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO, 60 Minutes interview, December 1, 2013 In a 2013 interview on CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes , Jeff Bezos introduced Amazon\u2019s ambitious plan for Prime Air, a drone-based delivery system aiming to deliver packages within 30 minutes. Bezos projected that the service could be operational in four to five years, pending regulatory approvals. VR is going to need 10 years to become a very mainstream big thing. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, F8 Developer Conference, April 12, 2016 During his keynote at the F8 Developer Conference, Zuckerberg outlined Facebook\u2019s 10-year roadmap, emphasizing virtual reality ( VR ) as a key component. He acknowledged that while VR had significant potential to enhance social connections, it would require a decade to become mainstream. Einstein is now every customer\u2019s data scientist. Marc Benioff, Salesforce CEO, Press Release, September 19, 2016 At the launch of Salesforce Einstein, Benioff proclaimed that Einstein would serve as every customer\u2019s data scientist , aiming to democratize artificial intelligence by embedding it across all Salesforce applications. He envisioned a future where AI would be integral to every aspect of business operations. However, by 2025, while AI has become more prevalent, the universal integration Benioff predicted has been tempered by challenges in implementation, data quality, and user adoption. Self-driving cars will take over the roads very soon. Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, TED Talk, April 2017 Musk predicted that by the end of 2017 a Tesla would drive from Los Angeles to New York without the driver touching the wheel at any point. Despite major strides in Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving technology, that fully autonomous cross-country trip\u2014and Level 5 autonomy more broadly\u2014still hasn\u2019t happened. From our standpoint, if you fast forward a year, maybe a year and three months, but next year for sure, we\u2019ll have over a million robotaxis on the road. Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, Autonomy Investor Day, April 22, 2019 At Tesla\u2019s Autonomy Investor Day, Musk confidently predicted that Tesla would have over a million autonomous robotaxis operating by 2020. He acknowledged potential regulatory hurdles but maintained that the technology would be ready. Quantum computing will arrive as soon as 2023, fueling innovation in pharmaceuticals, finance, and chemicals. Arvind Krishna, IBM CEO, Interview with Fortune, December 2020 Krishna expressed confidence that quantum computing would move from experimentation to commercial use by 2023, particularly in fields requiring advanced simulation and optimization. Final Thoughts What\u2019s so striking about these failed predictions isn\u2019t just their inaccuracy\u2014it\u2019s the pedigree of the people making them. These weren\u2019t fringe commentators or uninformed skeptics. They were industry titans, world-renowned CEOs , celebrated economists, and respected journalists. Many of them were surrounded by some of the brightest minds in technology, had access to cutting-edge research, and still managed to miss the mark\u2014sometimes by miles. That should give all of us pause. In some cases, the boldness of these statements may have been driven by the pressures of leadership, media narratives, or even attempts to reassure stockholders. But that only makes the misfires more fascinating. If people this smart, this informed, and this experienced can get it so wrong, what does that say about our ability to predict the future\u2014especially in a space as fast-moving and unpredictable as technology? That\u2019s exactly why I\u2019ve stopped making predictions. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have strong opinions or informed instincts\u2014I do. But I\u2019ve learned the hard way that humility is a much safer bet than certainty. The future has a way of surprising us, over and over again. So rather than try to forecast it, I\u2019d rather stay curious, adaptable, and open-minded. Because if history teaches us anything, it\u2019s this: the next laughably wrong prediction could be our own. Please leave this field empty Appreciate this content?

Yes, I\u2019m serious. I started my work on the web more than two decades ago. My first site was Helping Hand, which curated the best sites from around the web to help people with their computers and navigate resources on the Internet. Years later, I sold the domain to a company that helped folks quit smoking, one of my first big contracts. I began blogging on Blogger and waxed poetic about everything from politics to Internet tools. I was all over the place and mostly wrote for myself \u2013 without much of an audience. I belonged to a Marketing Book club in Indianapolis that quickly grew out of control. Over time, I discovered that more and more of the group were coming to me for technology advice. The combination of my technology background and my business and marketing acumen was in high demand as the Internet rapidly changed the industry. After reading Naked Conversations , I was motivated to better brand and control the content on the site. I also wanted more control over the look and feel of my blog, so I moved to my domain in 2006 and built my first WordPress site. Since I was focused on marketing technology, I didn\u2019t want the domain with my name to get in the way, so I moved the site (painfully) to its new domain in 2008 where it\u2019s grown ever since. The Martech Zone is owned and operated by DK New Media, LLC, a company I started in 2009. After working with virtually every major online marketing department in my tenure at ExactTarget and launching Compendium, I knew there was a great demand for my expertise and guidance within such a complex industry.

Yes, it's an alphabetic writing system, not an abugida. What makes the Santali alphabet really elusive is that it resembles the shapes of the undeciphered Indus Valley script. Soviet archaeologists once tried to decipher IVC seals using Santali alphabet. Sounds ridiculous, but it's a sad truth that Santali is a unique language with little to no academic attention having been paid to it. What makes Santali language itself stand out is the lack of \"indianization\" as compared to even Southeast Asian Austroasiatic languages like Mon and Khmer. Its phonology is still archetypically East Asian with a superimposed South Asian areal layer. Its morphology is somewhat mixed between SEA Austroasiatic prefixing and (self-innovative) highly polysynthetic verb akin to the Kiranti languages (spoken ~20 kilometres away in Nepal), so Santali is not remotely influenced by Sanskrit, except for a few Austroasiatic loanwords in early Vedic Sanskrit.

The resemblances to Indus glyphs are deliberate. The Santali language belongs to the Munda branch of Austronesian. Yves Rehbein said, April 18, 2025 @ 8:14 am I see no implication of ancient continuity: \"The Ol Chiki script was created in 1925 by Raghunath Murmu for the Santali language,\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ol_Chiki_script Santali is a Munda language in the Austroasiatic super family. Although Munda is frequently mentioned as a probable candidate for Indus Script (mostly due to Witzel in the Western perception, I suppose), it is considered less likely. In contrast, an unknown \"language x\" that cannot be probed is improbable but not less likely. This is para-consistent logic. The arguments about Indus Script are chiefly inductive reasoning because it cannot be verified. So, readings may make sense (every swan that I have seen was white) but this does not exclude exceptions (a black swan event). I have only half listened to a philosophy podcast discussing Popper and Wittgenstein. Suffice it to say the lexicon of reconstructed Proto-Munda should be interesting. Some phono-semantic matches with this or that are virtually guaranteed. Proto-Munda *harkE \"moon\" vs. *a\u014baj \"moon\" (Rau apud Wikipedia) is internally inconsistent, for example . My first thought goes to Sanskrit ruc, Latin lux \"light\", and incidentally luna \"moon\". However, Indo-European comparanda for light, bright, moon, sky, storm, cloud, dark etc. (e.g. Latin lux \"light\", luna \"moon\") are so easy to find, they find me, e.g. Armenian erkink\u02bb \"sky\", uncertain to PIE *dyew- when I was looking for a verb \"to know\" (as of witness vis-a-vis white, visual etc.).

[Mike Blake/Reuters] By Amy Sherman | PolitiFact Published On 14 Apr 2025 14 Apr 2025 United States President Donald Trump and his allies have offered a solution to avoiding price hikes because of his car tariffs : buy American. Trump told NBC News on March 29 that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if foreign car manufacturers raised prices in response to tariffs. \u201cI hope they raise their prices because if they do, people are going to buy American-made cars,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have plenty.\u201d The administration\u2019s 25 percent tariff on imported cars took effect on April 3, and an additional tariff on imported auto parts is set to take effect on May 3. Tariffs are a tax on imported goods that businesses pay. Their costs are often passed down to consumers through higher prices. Fox News host Jesse Watters made a similar statement to Trump on April 3: \u201cIf you\u2019re worried cars are going to cost more, buy American.\u201d Watters cited a clip of Ford Motor Co\u2019s promotion to temporarily give customers its employee rate on cars. Bernie Moreno, a Republican senator from Ohio who owned multiple car dealerships before taking office, echoed Trump in an April 2 CNN interview. Advertisement Moreno said the \u201conly ones that are mostly hurt are the cars that are made overseas, exclusively, and are shipped into the United States. The ultra-luxury cars.\u201d However, this is contradicted by an analysis by Cox Automotive, a research firm, which found that the \u201c25 percent tariff on imported vehicles will apply to nearly 80 percent of vehicles priced under $30,000\u201d. The analysis cited models such as the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Chevy Trax and Trailblazer, Nissan Sentra and Honda HR-V. Senator Moreno added that among \u201cmainstream cars \u2013 a Honda, a Toyota, a Subaru, a Ford, a Chevy \u2013 if one car goes up in price, because there\u2019s a tariff, that person will just buy the other one that doesn\u2019t have a tariff, which is your American-made automobile\u201d. Many car experts said it is not so simple to avoid price increases by buying US cars, because those assembled in the US also use imported parts. \u201cThe concept of an American-made car with all parts from the US is a fictional tale,\u201d said Daniel Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. \u201cThey will tariff those parts.\u201d Car companies rely on imported parts to varying degrees. For example, the Tesla Model Y has 70 percent of the value of its parts made in the US or Canada. For the Ford F-150, it is 45 percent. The Trump administration has said that by raising revenue through tariffs, other federal taxes could be cut. But economists have said it is unlikely that high tariffs could generate enough revenue to result in meaningful tax reductions for typical Americans. Advertisement In response to a PolitiFact email asking about Moreno\u2019s statement on US-made cars, a spokesperson for the senator attacked the publication and provided no answers to its questions about cars and tariffs. The White House, when contacted, said that some auto parts are exempted from tariffs. Many US car manufacturers use imported parts Moreno said that US-assembled cars that get parts from Mexico and Canada will be \u201ccompletely tariff-free\u201d if they comply with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump\u2019s administration negotiated in 2018. But many auto parts used in the US come from countries other than Mexico and Canada. Jason Miller, a Michigan State University supply chain management professor, examined auto tariff data and told PolitiFact that it showed Mexico \u201cclearly top of the list\u201d for car parts imported into the US. China is second (because of lithium-ion batteries), Japan is fourth, South Korea is fifth and Germany is sixth. Miller said Trump\u2019s other tariffs on steel and aluminium mean that even if a car were 100 percent assembled from only domestic components, costs would still rise because steel and aluminium prices are increasing in the US. \u201cThey just aren\u2019t oversimplifying things, they are outright lying,\u201d Miller said about people saying car shoppers can buy all US-made cars. Also, not all auto parts from Mexico comply with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, so those are being tariffed, too, he said. Amy R Broglin-Peterson, a Michigan State University expert on supply chain management, said, \u201cAll vehicles use at least some percentage of foreign parts \u2013 period. There is no vehicle model that uses 100 percent American-manufactured parts.\u201d Advertisement The Wall Street Journal reported on April 4 that, at first glance, Ford is best positioned to weather tariffs because 80 percent of its cars, pick-up trucks and SUVs sold in the US are manufactured domestically, and so are many of the parts. Many components of Ford\u2019s F-150s, such as alternators and wheels, come from other countries and, starting in May, those parts could face a new 25 percent tax. The Wall Street Journal wrote, \u201cSo even though Ford\u2019s trucks are built in the American heartland, import tariffs could jack up the average price by thousands of dollars\u201d. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) publishes data about the US and Canadian content by value of the parts used to assemble passenger motor vehicles in the US and foreign countries. The data shows that some Toyota car lines built in the US, such as Corolla, include at least 25 percent value of parts imported from Japan. A Toyota spokesperson said that 47 percent of vehicles the company sold in the US in 2024 were built in the US. USA Today analysed NHTSA data for multiple automakers and found that \u201cfor all models assembled and available for sale in the US, 47 percent of the parts (by value) originated from the US or Canada\u201d. A Cox Automotive spokesperson said that the average US-made vehicle has about 50 percent of its parts or components by value imported. Car prices could rise because of Trump\u2019s tariffs The long-term effect of the tariffs on the car industry us difficult to predict. Cox Automotive predicted strong sales until the pre-tariff inventory declines. Advertisement \u201cBut all roads lead to this fact: In the coming months and years, as new tariffs settle into place, vehicle prices in the US are expected to increase,\u201d Cox wrote in an April 4 market insights report. Cox predicted that vehicles affected by these tariffs could see prices increase by 10 percent to 15 percent, and at least a 5 percent increase for vehicles not subject to the full tariff. \u201cProduction disruptions and declines could be a reality this summer, especially as automakers and suppliers work to align practices with the new rules,\u201d Cox wrote. As the price of cars manufactured in foreign countries rises, producers of competing US models with fewer imported parts will raise their prices, not dollar for dollar, but perhaps 40 cents per dollar, Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, predicted. \u201cUS auto manufacturers are hurting, and they will raise prices where they can,\u201d Hufbauer said.

Tycoon2FA, a phishing kit discovered in 2023 by cybersecurity firm Sekoia, was recently updated to improve its evasion capabilities. The phishing kit now uses advanced evasion tactics such as a custom CAPTCHA via HTML5 canvas, invisible Unicode in obfuscated JavaScript, and anti-debugging scripts to bypass detection and hinder analysis. \u201cLately, the Tycoon 2FA landing pages have incorporated a clever obfuscation technique using invisible Unicode characters. This technique, when paired with JavaScript Proxy objects, is designed to complicate static analysis and defer script execution until runtime.\u201d reported Trustwave . \u201cThis behavior is demonstrated in a real-world Tycoon 2FA phishing landing page, as shown in this Urlscan.io session: https://urlscan.io/result/0195c73f-bfd0-7000-8386-94b11ace6088/dom/ \u201c Source: Trustwave \u2013 Tycoon 2FA using invisible Unicode characters to encode JavaScript code. The obfuscation is actually quite simple but clever. Tycoon 2FA replaced third-party CAPTCHAs like Cloudflare Turnstile with a custom HTML5 canvas-based solution. This improvement allows for evading detection, reduces fingerprinting, and hinders automated analysis using randomized text, noise, and distortions. The Phishing-as-a-Service platform uses anti-debugging scripts to block dev tools, detect automation, prevent right-click, and spot paused execution. If analysis is suspected, it redirects to rakuten.com boosting evasion and extending phishing campaign lifespans. \u201cThe recent updates to the Tycoon 2FA kit show a clear move toward stealth and evasion.

The stock remains nearly 47% below its December 2024 peak, and more downside could follow, as Tesla has historically underperformed the broader market in downturns. For instance, during the 2022 inflation shock, Tesla stock plunged 73.6% compared to a 25.4% drop in the S&P 500. This suggests further downside is possible. Separately, want exposure to AI? Should you Buy MSFT Stock At $400? Tesla\u2019s vehicle deliveries have declined, with the company reporting 336,681 deliveries in Q1 2025, down 13% year-over-year. The situation could deteriorate further. The U.S.-China trade war is intensifying, with President Trump raising tariffs on Chinese goods to 125%, while China responded with an 84% duty on American imports. Although Tesla manufactures in China at its Shanghai plant, potential anti-American sentiment and Elon Musk\u2019s perceived alignment with Trump may affect sales. China accounted for 21% of Tesla\u2019s revenue in the past year. The Shanghai facility, with a capacity of over 950,000 vehicles annually, produced over half of Tesla\u2019s 2024 shipments. Reduced sales and underutilization may squeeze margins, especially as competition from Chinese automakers surges with high-tech, competitively priced vehicles. The U.S. market outlook is more mixed. Tesla may benefit from its upcoming Robotaxi launch in Austin and a refreshed Model Y. However, Elon Musk\u2019s political involvement, particularly his role in the Trump administration, is alienating progressive consumers. While the new tariffs give Tesla a cost edge over competitors reliant on Mexican production, Tesla also sources many components from China and Mexico, potentially increasing its own costs. In Europe, the situation is grim. Tesla's Q1 market share in 15 European countries dropped to 9.3% from 17.9% a year ago, following Musk\u2019s support of Germany\u2019s far-right AfD party during February elections. Fundamentally, Tesla\u2019s metrics don't justify its high valuation. Despite strong operating performance and financial stability, as outlined below, investors seeking lower volatility might consider the Trefis High-Quality Portfolio , which has outpaced the S&P 500 with over 91% returns since inception.

In the US-China trade war, Beijing needs to stay ahead of the competition. This surprising move threatens to disrupt international manufacturing and security operations as countries scramble to find alternative suppliers. Rare Earths: The Backbone of Modern Technology US-China Trade War: Beijing Halts Rare Earth Exports, Affecting Global According to The New York Times , China dominates the global rare earth market, producing nearly 90% of the world's supply of these 17 essential elements. Rare earths are critical to the development of electric vehicles, smartphones, renewable energy technologies, advanced robotics, and military hardware such as missiles and drones. Among the rare earths now restricted are samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium-related compounds. These elements are particularly hard to source and refine, making China's export halt a direct threat to global production capabilities. Export Crackdown Hits US and Allied Industries The new export controls come in response to a sharp tariff hike imposed by former US President Donald Trump, which took effect on April 2. In retaliation, Beijing introduced sweeping export restrictions on key minerals, magnets, and advanced materials. The measures target both raw materials and finished products, making it even harder for companies to find quick replacements. Many Chinese ports have already halted shipments of these materials, as Beijing crafts a long-term regulatory framework. Once finalized, this new system could permanently block exports to certain foreign companies, including US military contractors and tech manufacturers. Supply Chain Disruption Looms for Auto and Semiconductor Giants From Tesla to Boeing, and from chipmakers to renewable energy developers, a wide array of industries could feel the pressure. Permanent magnets, in particular, are indispensable for electric vehicle motors, aircraft systems, and industrial automation. Analysts warn that the US and other Western nations lack sufficient domestic production to meet demand. America currently operates just one rare earth mine, with most of its supply still dependent on Chinese exports. DigiTimes reported that the rare earth export controls also threatened semiconductor manufacturers in South Korea . Originally published on Tech Times \u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

The Tesla CEO has spearheaded efforts to reduce the deficit by at least $1 trillion, held private meetings on Capitol Hill, and even attended cabinet meetings. However, Musk's growing influence in Washington may become a central factor in a Democratic resurgence in the 2026 midterms. In recent weeks, Musk's approval ratings have plummeted. A recent poll conducted by the Harvard Center for American Political Studies and Harris, which surveyed 2,746 registered voters between March 26 and 27, found that 49 percent of respondents view Musk unfavorably, compared to just 39 percent who view him favorably. This is a sharp decline from February, when 44 percent said they viewed Musk favorably, and an equal percentage viewed him unfavorably. Similarly, a YouGov/Economist poll, conducted between April 5-8 among 1,563 registered voters, showed a drop in Musk's favorability from 44 percent in January to 40 percent. Meanwhile, 54 percent of voters view him unfavorably, an increase from 48 percent in January. Pollster Nate Silver 's tracker also shows Musk's approval rating deep underwater, with 54 percent of Americans viewing him unfavorably and 40 percent viewing him favorably.

Since joining the Trump administration, Musk has aggressively pushed for policies aimed at slashing government spending, rolling back regulations, and downsizing the federal workforce, all in his role as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). These efforts have triggered a series of legal challenges and widespread public backlash. Just last week, thousands gathered in a series of global \"Hands Off!\" protests, expressing outrage over Musk's attempts to gut federal agencies and cut the federal workforce. Hundreds of \"Tesla Takedown\" demonstrations have also taken place, urging people to sell their Tesla vehicles and shares of the company's stock in protest of Musk. In March, its market value fell by 4 percent. Musk's political clout was also shaken this month by the defeat of Brad Schimel, the Trump-backed judicial candidate, who lost to Susan Crawford by a 9-point margin in Wisconsin, despite Musk pouring millions of dollars into backing the Republican candidate. Since then, political analysts and GOP strategists have pointed to Musk's increasingly polarizing image as a key factor in the loss.

Alishia Abodunde/Getty Images \"It was clear that his efforts to take a chainsaw to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are deeply unpopular with the majority of voters,\" Democratic strategist Doug Gordon told Newsweek . In response, a group of 77 House Democrats, led by Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Greg Casar, is launching a campaign to force Musk to resign from his position at DOGE by May 30, saying it is \"for the good of the country.\" Amid Musk's declining popularity, Democrats are starting to see a path to recovery in the 2026 midterms after the party faced a humiliating defeat in the 2024 election, with Trump improving his vote share in almost every state, and the Republicans taking the House and the Senate . Pollster Adam Carlson suggested that Democrats could adopt a strategy similar to the one Republicans used in 2010, when they targeted then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , whose low favorability ratings made her a more effective target than President Barack Obama , who was still relatively popular. Carlson argued that Musk, much like Pelosi at the time, could become a potent symbol for Democratic opposition, particularly if his favorability continues to decline while Trump's approval remains stable due to the loyalty of his base. However, recent polls have shown Trump's approval rating declining as well. \"Musk could serve as a powerful 'bonus bogeyman' for Democrats, particularly in tight races across the House, Senate, and state-level contests,\" Carlson said. \"As we saw in Wisconsin last week, Musk is so electorally toxic that just the idea of him might be enough.\" Carlson also noted that while Democrats should focus their attacks on Trump ahead of the 2026 midterms, \"having that bonus bogeyman who is loathed by swing voters could be pivotal in key House, Senate, governor, and downballot races.\" Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science and director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, agreed, telling Newsweek : \"Elon Musk will certainly have a political target on his back in the 2026 midterms. The fact that DOGE is waning in popularity, and many voters resent Musk trying to buy elections with his wealth, will serve as energizers for the Democratic base.\" \"Musk does offer the Democrats an advantage in campaigning in that he is increasingly unpopular and his wealth is very otherworldly to most Americans,\" G. Elliott Morris, former director of 538 for ABC News, said. Democratic strategist Christy Setzer pointed to recent protests and strong special election results as signs of rising Democratic momentum. Setzer sees Musk as a powerful symbol for Democrats to rally against, particularly if they tie him directly to Trump, framing both as a unified threat. \"There's a clear and obvious upside in going after Musk\u2014just ask the Wisconsin electorate, who showed him the door in dramatic fashion just last week,\" Setzer said. Indeed, in Wisconsin's recent Supreme Court election, the Democrats framed their victory as a repudiation of Musk. Following their success, DNC Chair Ken Martin issued a statement criticizing both Trump and Musk for undermining key social programs like Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare, all in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. He also blamed their economic policies\u2014especially the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs\u2014for eroding consumer confidence and fueling fears of a recession. On a recent episode of the Hacks On Tap podcast, former Obama-era adviser David Axelrod characterized the recent Wisconsin election as \"a referendum on Elon Musk,\" not Trump. \"Democrats see it as more fruitful to go after Musk,\" Axelrod explained.

Scott Olson/Getty Images However, Gift warned that while Musk and DOGE's declining popularity could energize the Democratic base, the party still needs a compelling, positive agenda to make significant inroads. \"Democrats still need a positive message about what they stand for. Like in November's election, simply running against Trump or against Musk won't be enough for Democrats to make the kind of gains in the House and Senate they hope for in 2026.\" Morris echoed this caution, noting that it is unlikely to repair the party's credibility on key issues such as crime, inflation, and trade, where voters still express skepticism. \"I do not think the backlash to him alone will be enough to repair the party's credibility where it was before [Joe] Biden took office,\" Morris told Newsweek . \"Americans tell pollsters they do not trust Democrats to handle crime, the economy, inflation, guns, trade, etc. Just fighting against Musk will not fix all of those problems for them.\" In order to retake the House and the Senate in the 2026 midterms, the Democrats face an uphill battle. Since Trump won against his opponent Kamala Harris , the Democratic Party has seen record-low approval ratings. According to an NBC News poll from March 7-11, 55 percent of respondents said they had a negative view of the Democratic Party, while 27 percent said they had a positive perception. That is the lowest level recorded since NBC News began asking the question in 1990. There was also evidence of dissatisfaction with the party from its base, with 20 percent of Democratic voters viewing it negatively, twice as high as the figure for Republicans who had a negative view of their party. The poll had a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Some recent polls have also shown that Trump's approval rating among Democrats is actually rising, indicating that some voters may be less hostile to him than in the past. In a recent interview on Real Time with Bill Mahe r, California Governor Gavin Newsom described his party's brand as \"toxic.\" \"Democrats, we tend to be a little more judgmental than we should be,\" Newsom added. \"We need to own our mistakes. We need to own what's wrong with our party.\" But Setzer argued that her party's popularity has declined because it has been weak in the face of Trump\u2014something that has frustrated voters. \"Democrats aren't standing up strongly against the biggest threat to our economy and our democracy in history,\" she told Newsweek . Looking ahead to the 2026 midterms, Setzer argues that if Democrats want to use the unpopularity of figures like Musk as part of their campaign, they must connect that negative image directly to Trump. By doing so, they can use the public's dislike of Musk to also weaken the president's support. Setzer believes this strategy\u2014attacking both at the same time\u2014can help diminish Trump's power and mobilize voters against him. \"Democrats, r anyone who wishes to stop Trump, need to make sure they're tying Musk's toxicity to Trump and taking him down in the process,\" Setzer said. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

By Reuters | Updated: 14 April 2025 13:19 IST Photo Credit: Reuters Musk and Altman cofounded ChatGPT maker OpenAI in 2015 Highlights Musk sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman last year He accused OpenAI of straying from its founding mission OpenAI was founded to develop AI for the good for humanity Advertisement A dozen former OpenAI employees filed a legal brief on Friday backing co-founder Elon Musk's lawsuit aimed at keeping the non-profit status of OpenAI, marking the latest development in the dispute over the future of the artificial intelligence firm. Corporate leaders want to give investors control, drawing a host of concerns and a lawsuit from Musk and others who say business interests must be subordinated to humanitarian goals. Last year, Musk , who is also the CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman , accusing OpenAI of straying from its founding mission - to develop AI for the good of humanity, not corporate profit. OpenAI and Altman have denied the allegations. ChatGPT Can Now Remember and Reference Your Previous Conversations In their federal court filing on Friday, the former employees contended that stripping the nonprofit of its controlling role would \"fundamentally violate\" its mission, as it would lose oversight of the for-profit AI development entity. The former OpenAI employees, who said they held technical and leadership roles in the company, said the nonprofit's oversight was crucial to its overall strategy, and that while they worked at the firm, OpenAI executives had emphasised repeatedly the structure's importance in OpenAI's ability to execute on its mission. The structure also helped with recruitment, and many employees joined because they were inspired by the nonprofit's mission, they said. OpenAI has argued that it needs to remove the nonprofit's controlling role in order to raise funds from investors. The nonprofit will retain a stake in OpenAI that will become increasingly valuable as the company grows, enriching the nonprofit with deep resources to carry out its mission, the company argues. OpenAI Could Buy Jony Ive and Sam Altman\u2019s AI Devices Startup In a statement, OpenAI said the transition would not affect its mission: \u201cOur Board has been very clear: our nonprofit isn't going anywhere and our mission will remain the same.\u201d Musk and Altman cofounded ChatGPT maker OpenAI in 2015, but Musk left before the company became a technology star. Musk's opposition to the change in structure led to the current suit, and the two parties are set to begin a jury trial in spring next year. Recently Musk also went on to create his own AI firm, xAI , in 2023, and Altman alleges that Musk has been trying to slow down a competitor. OpenAI, meanwhile, faces pressure from investors to change its structure. In order for OpenAI to secure a $40 billion (roughly Rs. 3,44,386 crore) fundraising round, the company must complete its transition by the end of the year. \u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2025 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

(AFP via Getty Images, left, and AP file images) By Douglas Schoen PUBLISHED: April 14, 2025 at 3:17 AM EDT The very public \u2013 and often sophomoric\u2013 fights emerging within President Trump\u2019s inner circle have exposed the many different factions desperately competing for Trump\u2019s ear. The two spats \u2013 one between Elon Musk and trade advisor Peter Navarro and the other between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick \u2013 burst into the public\u2019s view this week as chaos over Trump\u2019s trade policy unnerved markets and business leaders. Ultimately, these fights have immense consequences for the future of Trump\u2019s term. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt attempted to brush the issue aside, saying, \u201cboys will be boys,\u201d but the emerging fissures go deeper than mere disagreements over tariff policies. They are symbolic of a proxy war between the longtime MAGA loyalists and the more recent, often more practical \u2013 or less extreme \u2013 supporters. The former are represented by committed ideologues like Navarro, Lutnick and Steve Bannon, who have long pushed Trump to adopt more hardline policies. At the same time, the latter, represented by Musk and other tech and finance titans like Bill Ackman are less idealistic, having backed Trump hoping he would usher in economic prosperity and take a more centrist, common-sense approach to social and cultural issues. Of the two conflicts, the one between Musk and Navarro has been the most public, largely taking place on Musk\u2019s X platform. After Musk took to X to push back against heavy-handed tariffs, Navarro went on CNBC and derided Musk\u2019s Tesla as a simple \u201ccar assembler\u201d rather than an actual \u201ccar manufacturer.\u201d Navarro then insinuated that Tesla\u2019s manufacturing process undermines Trump\u2019s preference for American-made cars, clearly striking a nerve with the world\u2019s richest man and most visible Trump supporter. Musk responded by saying Navarro is \u201ctruly a moron,\u201d accused him of spreading false information, referred to Navarro as \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks.\u201d Plainly, opinions of Musk aside, his position on trade and tariffs is the correct one. Where he believes in truly free trade and understands the benefits of increased global trade, Navarro has been the administration\u2019s loudest champion of protectionist tariffs that would strangle American businesses, bring global trade to a halt, and likely cause a recession. Put another way, Trump would be wise to pay greater attention to the segment of Trump\u2019s coalition that Musk represents \u2013 practical, libertarian, and committed to American dominance of the future industries that will shape the global economy \u2013 than the more extreme, isolationist wing led by Navarro. The other fight within the administration, between Bessent and Lutnick, has not been nearly as public, but it may be even more important for the American economy. Indeed, Bessent has reportedly been advising Trump that tariffs must be a negotiating tactic, rather than a permanent policy, including flying to Florida to push the president to soften his tone. According to Politico , Bessent \u201ctold Trump that markets would remain in peril unless he started putting more emphasis\u201d on the endgame of tariffs \u2013 new trade deals \u2013 and stopped talk of the \u201cpain\u201d Americans would have to endure in a protracted trade war. Bessent\u2019s approach is in direct conflict with Lutnick, who has made regular media appearances stressing that high tariffs are permanent, including telling CNN , Trump is \u201cnot going to back off on tariffs.\u201d Lutnick\u2019s tenure has been marked by these sorts of gaffes. During a CNBC interview on Wednesday, he credited Trump\u2019s policies for the historic surge in the stock market, seemingly oblivious that it was entirely due to Trump doing the very thing Lutnick pledged he wouldn\u2019t do \u2013 backing off on tariffs. On the trade issue, it appears that the Bessent-Musk wing won out, for now at least. The 90-day pause Trump announced on Wednesday may not be a guarantee of no future trade war, but it does give time to negotiate the kind of deals Bessent has advocated for, while suspending the suffocating tariffs pushed by Navarro. Undoubtedly, that policy is the correct one. Had the initial tariffs remained in force for months, the U.S. almost inevitably would have entered a recession. To be sure, these divisions are not new. They have been simmering since even before the inauguration. Last December, the cracks in Trump\u2019s coalition first emerged over the issue of H-1B visas for highly skilled immigrants. Musk was again leading one side, arguing that these workers allowed American tech companies to maintain their global advantage. The other side, led by Bannon and Laura Loomer, fiercely pushed back, claiming that these migrants \u2013 mostly from India \u2013 were taking jobs away from Americans. Trump eventually came down on Musk\u2019s side, ending that fight, but not the overarching issue of courting a coalition with wildly different \u2013 and often contradictory \u2013 views. For example, Loomer is now apparently back in Trump\u2019s good graces, reportedly being behind the firing of multiple national security officials for supposed \u201cdisloyalty\u201d to the president. Nobody should be under any illusion that the infighting will stop anytime soon. It is a feature of Trump administrations, not an anomaly. Perhaps more than any other president, Trump thrives on playing off his advisor\u2019s diverging views. However, it is clear that if Trump wants to have a successful second term, help Republicans maintain both chambers of Congress, and safeguard his own political legacy, he should lean on the more reserved, professional, and less ideological wing of his coalition. Allowing the extreme, MAGA-loyalists to drive the administration\u2019s policies not only risks wrecking the American economy, but on a wider scale, it risks undermining the Republican Party for years to come.

Supplied The number of electric vehicles (EVs) in use in Cambodia is expected to rise significantly by the end of this year, with a BYD assembly plant scheduled to begin turning out new vehicles in late 2025. During an April 10 meeting between the leadership of the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) and a delegation from BYD Auto Industry Co., Ltd., Sun Chanthol, first vice-president of the CDC, expressed his appreciation to BYD\u2019s leadership for choosing Cambodia as the location for another assembly plant in the Southeast Asian region. The BYD delegation was led by Xiao Haiping, executive director of the BYD Group President\u2019s Office, who confirmed that the plant is expected to begin operations in the fourth quarter of next year. Chanthol explained that, as the Royal Government\u2019s one-stop service body, the CDC is always ready to facilitate and coordinate all private sector investment activities in Cambodia to ensure a favourable, flexible and beneficial investment climate. He also noted that the trend of using BYD cars in Cambodia is on the rise. \u201cOnce the electric vehicle assembly plant is completed and officially begins operations in the fourth quarter of 2025, the usage rate of BYD vehicles in Cambodia is expected to increase even further,\u201d he added. According to BYD executives, a groundbreaking ceremony for the assembly plant is scheduled for the end of April. The BYD assembly plant will be located in the Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, which offers convenient transportation access for various components. The plant will involve an investment of over $30 million and is expected to have a production capacity of 10,000 vehicles per year. Recently, BYD also introduced new vehicle models into the Cambodian market, such as the BYD SEALION 5 and BYD ATTO 2, which it described as \u201cnot only high quality and equipped with advanced technology, but also highly fuel-efficient and affordably priced for the Cambodian market\u201d. In June 2024, Prime Minister Hun Manet declared BYD\u2019s establishment of an assembly plant in Cambodia as a major success for the Royal Government\u2019s efforts to attract international investors to the Kingdom. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport recently reported that the number of registered EVs in Cambodia has increased significantly. In 2024, a total of 2,253 EVs were registered \u2014 a 620% increase over 2023, when only 313 new EVs were registered. The report showed that the most popular EV brands in Cambodia are BYD, Toyota and Tesla. Currently, there are six car assembly plants operating in Cambodia, including those for Ford, SsangYong, Hyundai, Kia, GTV and Toyota. latest news Economist: No need for concern over Cambodia\u2019s 90% Chinese trade deficit Drug awareness campaign stepped up during New Year festivities BYD assembly plant to begin Cambodian operations by end of year Fire destroys two motorboats in Kampot province Marigolds bloom for New Year at Tbong Khmum provincial festival Wing Bank Eliminates Cash-Out Fees, Forgoes Millions to Advance Financial Inclusion Rubber exports down as domestic demand increases Gasoline, diesel prices drop by 150 riel Cambodia\u2019s international Q1 trade surged 15% year-on-year Record-setting bridge opens to public for KNY Must Watch More Videos \u276f Shots fired!

( Reuters: Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo ) In short: Donald Trump says he will announce the tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, with new sector-specific tariffs to be created. It comes just two days after the White House issued a tariff exemption for various electronics, which it now says is temporary. What's next? Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday, US time. abc.net.au/news/donald-trump-to-announce-tariffs-on-semiconductors/105174046 Link copied Share Share article The Trump administration has indicated it will develop a new suite of tariffs on the semiconductor industry, separate to the \"reciprocal\" tariffs already announced for most American trading partners. Commonly known as chips, semiconductors are the foundation for most electronic devices. On Friday, local time, the government issued a tariff exemption for a range of electronics exported to the United States. The notice, published by US Customs and Border Protection, applied to items such as smartphones, computers, hard-drives, flat-panels, some chips and the machines used to make them. US exempts smartphones and computers from Trump's reciprocal tariffs Photo shows A woman sits in front of her laptop with her smartphone, using a two factor authentication app The exemptions cover various electronic goods including smartphones and components entering the US from China. The exemption means tech products arriving from China, which is currently subject to a 145 per cent tariff, and other nations, which are facing a 10 per cent baseline tariff amid a 90-day pause on the levies initially announced on \" Liberation Day\", would have no tariffs imposed on them. But on Sunday, US President Donald Trump said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from his reciprocal tariffs would be short-lived, and that they would be instead be classified under a forthcoming category of tariffs specific to the semiconductor sector. \"The tariffs will be in place in the not too distant future,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One. Asked what the rate for semiconductors would be, he said: \"I'm going to be announcing it over the next week\", adding that there would be flexibility for some companies. Separately, in a social media post on Sunday, Mr Trump said his government would open an investigation examining the trade of semiconductors in the context of their national security implications. Those electronics \"are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket',\" he wrote. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONIC SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\" Donald Trump told media onboard Air Force One on Sunday he would announce the semiconductor tariff rate in the coming week. ( Reuters: Nathan Howard TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY ) Other White House officials also downplayed the significance of the exemption announced on Friday, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick telling US media those goods were to be included in the semiconductor tariffs \"coming in probably a month or two\". \"All those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they're going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,\" Mr Lutnick said . \"We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels \u2014 we need to have these things made in America. We can't be reliant on South-East Asia for all of the things that operate for us.\" Sector-specific semiconductor levies would follow the Trump administration's similar measures for the steel, aluminium and automobile industries announced in recent weeks. Big Tech in turmoil Washington's approach to tech imports, and what it hopes to achieve by distinguishing them into a new national security tariff regime, remains unclear. The ensuing turmoil has battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \"Magnificent Seven\" \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Sunday the White House \"is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand\". Mr Trump's broader so-called reciprocal tariffs have been framed as measures to boost domestic manufacturing and employment, as well as address US trade deficits. The Trump administration has predicted the trade war with China would prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time. ( AP: Yuki Iwamura, File ) The confusion around electronics tariffs is the latest of several turnarounds his trade policy has undergone. After announcing sweeping levies on virtually every country in the world on April 3, less than 14 hours after they took effect on April 9, Mr Trump announced a 90-day \"pause\", reducing the higher-rate tariffs to 10 per cent for every trading partner but China . It sparked a tit-for-tat with Beijing, with Mr Trump progressively increasing the levy on Chinese imports into the US from 84 per cent to 125 per cent. That was in addition to the 20 per cent tariff already imposed in February over China's alleged role in fentanyl supply chains . China has imposed a retaliatory tariff of 125 per cen t on American exports. The Chinese commerce ministry on Sunday welcomed the tariff exemption for electronics as a small step towards de-escalating trade tensions between the two countries, but called on the US to completely cancel the rest of the tariffs. Sparing tech goods from being tariffed could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that are not usually made in the US. Loading YouTube content It was expected to benefit big tech companies such as Apple and Samsung, and chip makers such as Nvidia. But with the Silicon Valley's supply chain heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets, building new plants to move manufacturing into the US would cost billions of dollars and take several years. Samsung, which mainly produces in Vietnam and South Korea, was given funding last year to build factories in Texas as part of the Biden government's efforts to bring more chip-making onshore. In 2024, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, India, and Cambodia were the largest exporters of semiconductor devices to the US . Mr Trump said he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday.

Balmer meticulously planned the assault, using Molotov cocktails and a hammer, intending harm. The attack caused severe damage to the historic residence, symbolizing the erosion of democratic norms. Bipartisan backlash condemned the violence, though media double standards on political violence persist. The incident highlights a broader crisis where extremism replaces democratic discourse with brute force. In the predawn hours of April 13, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, his wife Lori, their four children, and guests were jolted awake by state troopers banging on their door. An arsonist had just firebombed their Harrisburg residence, hurling homemade explosives through shattered windows in what authorities called a \"targeted\" act of terrorism. The suspect, Cody Balmer, 38\u2014who later admitted to \"harboring hatred\" toward Shapiro\u2014turned himself in after confessing he would have assaulted the governor with a hammer if confronted. This brazen attack underscores a chilling trend: the erosion of democratic norms as political violence becomes alarmingly routine in America. A premeditated assault on democracy Balmer\u2019s meticulously planned attack reads like a domestic terrorism manual. According to Pennsylvania State Police affidavits, he siphoned gasoline from a lawnmower, filled Heineken bottles to create Molotov cocktails, and walked an hour to the governor\u2019s mansion. Surveillance footage captured him scaling a perimeter fence, smashing windows with a hammer, and igniting fires in the piano and dining rooms\u2014spaces where Shapiro\u2019s family had hosted a Passover Seder hours earlier. \"He was very methodical in his approach,\" said Lt. Col. George Bivens. Balmer\u2019s admission that he anticipated harming occupants reveals intent beyond property damage; this was an attempted political assassination. The damage was severe : ceilings collapsed, furniture was reduced to ash, and Passover decorations lay blackened beside shattered glass. Yet the greater devastation is symbolic. The governor\u2019s residence\u2014a historic building housing state art and eight gubernatorial families since 1968\u2014was violated not by a random criminal, but by a man weaponizing ideological rage. The backlash was swift and cross-partisan. Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Greg Rothman called the attack \"unacceptable,\" emphasizing, \"There is no place for violence in our society.\" Shapiro, a Democrat, echoed this: \"I don\u2019t give a damn if it\u2019s coming from one particular side or the other \u2026 It has to stop.\" Such solidarity is critical, yet it raises uncomfortable questions. Would national media devote equal coverage if a Republican governor were targeted? Recent history suggests not. When a left-wing activist shot GOP Congressman Steve Scalise in 2017 or when Trump supporters faced violent riots in 2020, many outlets downplayed the ideological motives. This double standard fuels division. As Shapiro noted, violent rhetoric\u2014whether from fringe online forums or mainstream commentators\u2014creates a permission structure for extremists. Balmer\u2019s actions didn\u2019t emerge in a vacuum. They reflect a culture where dehumanizing political opponents has become routine. The broader crisis: Violence as political language The Shapiro attack joins a grim roster: with the 2017 shooting of Rep. Scalise joined by last year\u2019s assassination attempts against Donald Trump and the ongoing burning and firebombing of Tesla vehicles. The common thread? A rejection of democratic resolution in favor of brute force. Balmer\u2019s use of improvised explosives mirrors tactics seen in extremist playbooks, yet his profile\u2014a Harrisburg local with prior theft charges\u2014defies easy categorization. This unpredictability makes such threats harder to combat. Critically, Balmer\u2019s hatred wasn\u2019t abstract. He told police he knew Shapiro might be home, accepting the risk of casualties. This distinguishes the act from mere vandalism; it was terrorism designed to intimidate a sitting official and his constituents. Authorities charged Balmer with eight felonies, including terrorism and attempted murder. Yet legal consequences alone won\u2019t remedy the societal sickness enabling such violence. Shapiro\u2019s refusal to be \"deterred\" is commendable, but his call for unity must be matched by systemic action: bolstering security for officials, de-escalating incendiary rhetoric, and rejecting partisan hypocrisy in condemning attacks. The fire at the governor\u2019s mansion is a flare illuminating America\u2019s crisis of civility. When ideology justifies arson against elected leaders, democracy itself burns.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . Sam Altman, a dad and OpenAI's CEO, loves one smart crib for his baby son. His top baby gear picks so far are Cradlewise's crib and lots of burp cloths. At $1,999, Cradlewise is pricer than the Snoo \u2014 but it can be used for longer. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, is deep in new-dad life \u2014 and he's already sharing strong opinions on baby gear. \"We bought a lot of silly baby things that we haven't needed,\" he posted on X on Sunday night. \"But definitely I recommend a Cradlewise crib and a lot more burp rags than you think you could possibly need.\" Cradlewise hasn't made as many headlines as its older and bigger competitor, the Snoo \u2014 the sleek, motorized bassinet that's basically the Tesla of baby tech . The Snoo , designed by celebrity pediatrician Harvey Karp, has been the go-to setup for sleep-deprived parents for nearly a decade. It uses motion, white noise, and a built-in swaddle to gently rock babies back to sleep. Retailing at $1,695, or $159 a month to rent, the Snoo has amassed a devoted fan base, including celebrity parents like Justin Timberlake and Zoe Salda\u00f1a , who invested in the company. Altman's pick, Cradlewise, works a little differently \u2014 and at nearly $2,000, it's the pricier option. Instead of waiting for cries, it bounces the baby gently up and down to preempt fussing. It also skips the built-in swaddle, one of Snoo's signature features, and includes a built-in baby monitor and music features. Parents can use Cradlewise's crib for longer with a growing baby. The Snoo tops out at around six months old. Cradlewise converts from bassinet to crib, so it can be used until the baby turns two years old or meets other milestones, like weight. \"We're so grateful to Sam Altman for choosing Cradlewise for their baby,\" Radhika Patil, the CEO and cofounder of Cradlewise, told Business Insider. \"It means a lot coming from someone who truly understands the power of good tech.\" Snoo did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. 'Having a kid changed a lot of things' Altman and his husband, software engineer Oliver Mulherin, welcomed their baby boy in February . The newborn came early and spent some time in the neonatal intensive care unit.

It still feels a little paranoid to say it out loud: that the United States might be drifting toward something that looks a lot like Russia. Or Hungary. Or some unholy blend of theocratic nostalgia and corporate feudalism. But that gut feeling\u2014the one that says something\u2019s not right\u2014is getting harder to shake. The signs aren\u2019t exactly subtle, either. To anyone paying attention, they\u2019re plenty loud. But they\u2019re also easy to tune out, easy to dismiss as noise, as politics as usual. What\u2019s harder to ignore are the rituals. The reverence. The worship. The way power starts to look like something owed. We don\u2019t usually start naming highways after sitting presidents\u2014especially ones under multiple indictments, most especially ones wildly obsessed with power and openly musing about a third term. But here we are. A bill in Texas proposes to rename a stretch of I-35 the \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump Highway.\u201d It may not even pass, but that almost doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s one of a growing list of gestures aimed at deifying a man who, by any rational standard, should be facing serious consequences for his role in the January 6th insurrection\u2014an attack on the peaceful transfer of power that many legal scholars argue should disqualify him from office under the 14th Amendment , if not result in criminal charges for inciting sedition. Instead, we get a slow-motion canonization. Lawmakers have floated putting Trump\u2019s face on currency, making his birthday a federal holiday, and renaming airports in his honor . Some supporters even want to carve his likeness into Mount Rushmore. Religious leaders compare him to biblical kings \u2014chosen vessels, sent by God. This isn\u2019t politics anymore. It\u2019s mythology. It\u2019s the construction of a parallel reality where Trump isn\u2019t just a man, but a savior figure. The kind of figure who can do no wrong, whose followers speak of him in reverent tones, who must be protected at all costs. This is how democratic values rot\u2014not all at once, but through the slow normalization of idolatry disguised as patriotism. But mythology only works if it can crowd out reality. Repression needs scaffolding\u2014and no tool is more effective than confusion. The Trump administration doesn\u2019t just clash with the press; it undermines the very concept of truth. \u201cFake news\u201d isn\u2019t a throwaway insult anymore\u2014it\u2019s a strategy. A sustained campaign to flood the information space and make facts feel optional. Reporters who challenge the administration are smeared as traitors or \u201cdeep state\u201d operatives. Trump still calls mainstream journalists \u201c the enemy of the people, \u201d echoing the language of the dictators and strongmen he seems to admire so much. Investigations are dismissed as partisan attacks. Whistleblowers are discredited before they speak. Independent newsrooms face lawsuits, threats, and coordinated disinformation campaigns designed to corrode public trust. And it works. The more chaotic the noise, the easier it is to tune out the signal. Truth becomes something to argue about, not act on. And once reality gets slippery, everything else is easier to break. Books get banned. Curricula get sanitized. Judges face harassment for upholding the law. Ordinary people start second-guessing what they post, what they share, what they say out loud. It doesn\u2019t take long for folks to forget what used to be obvious: opposition to authoritarianism is essential to a free society. *** I live in Austin, Texas, a city that prides itself on being an outlier inside a state that loves to talk about freedom while quietly legislating the opposite. This is a state where \u201csmall government\u201d somehow includes sweeping preemption laws, micromanaging what books kids can read, and controlling uteruses. The message is clear: freedom is fine\u2014as long as it\u2019s defined by those in power. Texas has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country \u2014providers can face life in prison, and even individuals assisting in abortion access risk legal consequences, even in cases of rape or incest. In public schools, Bible-based curricula are slipping into classrooms under the name of \u201cvalues\u201d or \u201cpatriotism,\u201d incentivized by lawmakers. It\u2019s not freedom\u2014it\u2019s state-mandated morality dressed up as tradition. There\u2019s a reflex in this country\u2014maybe in every country\u2014to label dissent as disloyalty. Criticize the government, and suddenly you\u2019re \u201canti-American.\u201d I don\u2019t buy that. I love this country and the ideals it\u2019s supposed to stand for. When I enlisted in the Army and volunteered for the infantry, I swore an oath. I\u2019ve seen firsthand what it means to put your body on the line for a set of principles. Sure, my war was Iraq. And in hindsight, it\u2019s clear we weren\u2019t exactly defending American freedoms by invading a nation that had nothing to do with 9/11. But the men I served with\u2014some of whom never came home\u2014weren\u2019t there for oil or politics. They were there because they believed in service. Many had volunteered in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks, willing to risk their lives to protect something bigger than themselves. They believed in the promise of liberty, accountability, and a system worth defending. And some of them probably support President Trump. I don\u2019t speak for them\u2014and while I respect their right to that choice, I won\u2019t pretend to understand it. But I do know what we all swore to uphold. Our oath wasn\u2019t to a man, or a party, or even a flag. It was to a Constitution\u2014one that\u2019s supposed to hold this nation together. (1) That\u2019s why this matters to me. When I see politicians twisting those principles into tools of repression, I don\u2019t call it patriotism. I call it what it is: a threat. And while there are many faces to that threat, perhaps none illustrates it more clearly right now than Elon Musk\u2014a man elected by no one, yet handed more control over federal institutions than most cabinet secretaries. His financial influence didn\u2019t just buy him a seat at the table. It bought him the table. *** Elon Musk\u2014billionaire, attention addict, CEO of everything\u2014holds real political power now. Not metaphorically, not just influence-by-Twitter (or X, or whatever that ad-choked echo chamber is calling itself today). Trump brought him in early to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency\u2014DOGE, which sounds like a joke until you realize it\u2019s not. As a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d Musk was handed sweeping authority to cancel contracts, slash programs, and restructure entire federal agencies. No election. No confirmation. No accountability\u2014except to Trump and his inner circle. Musk has used that power like a wrecking ball. USAID, gutted. The CFPB, gutted. The VA, slashed. Now the Department of Education is on the chopping block\u2014literally. Trump already signed the executive order to begin dismantling it, with the justification that schools should be governed \u201clocally.\u201d But the fallout is anything but local. Teachers\u2019 unions, the NAACP, and civil rights organizations are suing , warning that the move violates the Constitution and threatens to gut federal protections for vulnerable students. Meanwhile, DOGE\u2019s attempts to access sensitive agency data have been blocked by federal courts, citing privacy concerns and executive overreach. And like clockwork, Musk\u2019s signature chaos-management style has followed him into government: mass firings with little discernment, followed by quiet attempts to rehire the very people dismissed \u2014nuclear safety experts, pandemic response staff, oversight personnel\u2014when it turns out gutting institutions has consequences. Even Musk\u2019s own support is starting to wobble. His approval numbers have slipped. Protests have spread. Tesla cars have been vandalized, and a whole side hustle economy has popped up to cash in \u2014selling bumper stickers to owners who bought the car before they realized what kind of guy came with it. Movements like \u201c Tesla Takedown ,\u201d built around public shaming and targeted boycotts of Musk\u2019s brands, are picking up steam. Trump\u2019s base still defends him, mostly\u2014but they\u2019re beginning to sour on Musk. The golden boy of techno-libertarianism now looks a lot more like a self-dealing billionaire with too much control over their lives. Musk\u2019s role in the administration isn\u2019t just a weird twist of the Trump saga. It\u2019s a symptom of something much deeper: the corrosion of democratic norms in real time. When unelected billionaires are empowered to disassemble the federal government and profit from the fallout , we\u2019re not looking at innovation. We\u2019re looking at privatized power in patriotic packaging. Legal scholars are already sounding the alarm about a coming constitutional crisis. The rule of law is being selectively applied, courts are being ignored or sidelined, and the balance of power is being bent toward executive fiat. If the Constitution is a framework built on checks and balances, then we\u2019re watching those supports be quietly removed, one by one. This isn\u2019t hypothetical. It\u2019s happening. And if it continues unchecked, we\u2019re not just flirting with autocracy \u2014we\u2019re laying out a red carpet for it. And it\u2019s not happening in a vacuum. The courts have been methodically reengineered. Three Supreme Court justices were installed during Trump\u2019s first term \u2014after he lost the popular vote\u2014with help from a Senate that represents a minority of Americans. Lower courts have been stacked with ideologues who don\u2019t hide their contempt for civil rights. And then there are the laws\u2014quietly passed, easily overlooked\u2014that encourage citizens to snitch , sue, or surveil each other under the guise of morality or tradition. It\u2019s not just policy anymore; it\u2019s a culture shift. A moral panic turned into legislation. *** None of this is new. We\u2019ve seen this playbook before. Germany in the 1930s didn\u2019t collapse overnight. It slid\u2014through legal channels, institutional decay, and the slow boiling of norms. Russia didn\u2019t need a coup; it had bureaucracy, media control, and just enough plausible deniability. Hungary rewrote its constitution and wrapped its authoritarianism in flags and hymns. The slogans vary\u2014family, faith, purity, tradition\u2014but the structure is the same: consolidate power, erode checks, rebrand repression as righteousness. Here, it\u2019s not boots in the street\u2014it\u2019s bans in the library. It\u2019s teachers rewriting syllabi out of fear. It\u2019s protesters labeled extremists, and voting rights treated like optional extras. The message isn\u2019t \u201cyou can\u2019t speak.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cmaybe you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s the whisper before the silence. I\u2019m not a paranoid person. I have no patience for conspiracy freaks or tinfoil logic. I try to root my thinking in science and history\u2014in what can be known, what can be verified. But even so, I\u2019m not immune to the quiet worries that slip through the cracks. I\u2019m writing this on a device connected to the internet. Nothing is truly private. Nothing online ever really disappears. That\u2019s not a problem with this essay\u2014I plan to publish it. But what about private messages? Notes? Conversations with AI? Whether we like it or not, tools like ChatGPT are becoming fixtures in daily life. People use them to draft emails, unpack personal dilemmas, or ask the kinds of questions they\u2019re not ready to say out loud. But these aren\u2019t confidants. They\u2019re algorithms trained to guess the next likely word. No mind, no morals, no memory. Are they logging dissent? Mapping behavior? Storing keywords for some future review? Maybe not. Or maybe not yet. But let\u2019s not underestimate the creativity of bad actors with power. The infrastructure exists. And if the political winds shift hard enough, all it takes is a flip of a switch. When it comes to tech abuse, the current administration\u2019s incompetence might actually be our last line of defense. These are, after all, the same people who planned a military strike in a Signal group chat\u2014and accidentally invited a journalist. If Orwell wrote fiction, these guys are writing farce. Jokes aside, the surveillance state doesn\u2019t need to be competent\u2014just connected. Metadata is already vacuumed up. GPS logs, browsing habits, biometric patterns\u2014all cross-referenced with identities. If this all sounds like dystopian fiction, that\u2019s only because we\u2019ve been trained to think of it that way. But it\u2019s not fiction. The systems are real. The only thing missing is the right justification: National security. Public order. \u201cFamily values.\u201d \u201cProtecting the children.\u201d And then comes the refrain: If you\u2019ve got nothing to hide, you\u2019ve got nothing to fear. That\u2019s how it always starts. *** The threat isn\u2019t abstract anymore. It\u2019s not looming\u2014it\u2019s embedded. Not with jackboots and batons\u2014though keep going down this road and we\u2019ll get there\u2014but with procedural language and patriotic branding. It waits for fatigue to set in. For outrage to give way to apathy. For protest to feel futile, and speaking up to feel like a risk. We\u2019ve been conditioned to treat comparisons to fascism as melodramatic. Alarmist. But sometimes, alarmist just means paying attention. When journalists are attacked, when courts are captured, when books are pulled from shelves and history is rewritten in real time, it\u2019s not alarmist to say the house is on fire. It\u2019s responsible. Authoritarianism doesn\u2019t need everyone to go silent\u2014just enough people afraid of making noise. It thrives on hesitation. On people weighing the cost of resistance against the ease of going along. That\u2019s the most dangerous part\u2014not the censorship itself, but the internalized version. The self-editing. The second-guessing. The voice that says: Maybe just let it go. Maybe don\u2019t post that. Maybe don\u2019t write this. But I\u2019d rather name it now than whisper about it later. If this country is still salvageable\u2014and I believe it is\u2014it won\u2019t be because we waited politely. It\u2019ll be because enough people chose not to. Because silence isn\u2019t safety. It\u2019s surrender in slow motion. *** To Those Who Still Support President Trump Maybe you still support Donald Trump and his approach to governing. A lot of people clearly do. Or maybe you just choose to look the other way. Either way, ask yourself this: what happens when the next president isn\u2019t your guy? When someone you don\u2019t trust\u2014someone you don\u2019t like and didn\u2019t vote for\u2014inherits the same unchecked authority, the same gutted institutions, the same executive branch reshaped for loyalty over law? To be fair, this didn\u2019t start with Trump. The power of the presidency has been sliding in this direction for decades. But he sure as hell didn\u2019t slow it down\u2014he stepped on the gas. And that\u2019s the thing about power: once it expands, it rarely contracts. The people who come next don\u2019t give it back\u2014they just find new ways to use it\u2026 to abuse it. The Founders weren\u2019t perfect, but they knew what concentrated power could do. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t build a throne\u2014they built limits. Guardrails. And we\u2019re watching those get stripped for parts. You might like who\u2019s driving now. But what happens when you don\u2019t? Nick Allison is a former Army infantryman, a college dropout, and a writer based in Austin, Texas. He spends too much time reading about history, democracy, and systems in collapse\u2014and not enough time being optimistic about any of it. His interests include baseball, philosophy, and trying to make sense of the mess we call modern life. He\u2019s not a journalist or a pundit\u2014just a political independent, unaffiliated with any party, who still believes the Constitution is worth defending.

Bernard Keane Glenn Dyer Apr 14, 2025 4 min read Share 0 US President Donald Trump (Image: ABACAPRESS/Matias J. Ocner) The working rule for any major announcement by Donald Trump is that it will be reversed, modified or dismissed as never having happened within a matter of days. And that appears to apply as much to the reversals and modifications themselves. So that tariff backflip revealed on Friday (not the initial backflip, to reduce tariffs to 10% for everyone other than China, but the backflip to exclude semiconductor chips, smartphones and laptops made in China from the-nearly 150% tariffs on China) which was widely seen to have saved the bacon of Apple , given its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, turns out not to be an exemption at all. There will instead be a specific tech tariff, the administration said yesterday. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019,\u201d Trump raved . \u201cThere was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019 The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d The additional tech tariffs won\u2019t be revealed for one to two months, presumably giving the administration time to cobble together an equivalent to the kind of irrational, innumerate mathematical model it used to work up its now-ditched \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs.

Albanese and Marles will bend the knee \u2014 as will Dutton Bernard Keane 139 Friday\u2019s electronics backflip-that-wasn\u2019t was disseminated not via a White House PR stunt but a US Customs and Border Protection Service notice to shippers, which contained a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes, retroactive to 12.01am EDT (3.01pm Sydney time) on Saturday, April 5. Reuters reported that the notice \u201clisted 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays\u201d. That still leaves billions of dollars worth of kitchen and other households goods, toys, foodstuffs, machinery, car parts and similar products still paying the 145% China tariff. Big companies like Walmart, Target, Tesla, Ford, GM, Stellantis and their customers all face a sharp rise in costs and prices. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when it committed to invest US$500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. It similarly pledged a US$350 billion investment during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. This time the exemption took days to appear, and investors sold Apple shares down heavily as they speculated it would be the most impacted from the tariffs of all the tech heavies. That saw the market value of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms \u2014 slump US$2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2. Trump\u2019s latest move will add to the belief among investors and in bond markets that his administration has injected a permanent sense of uncertainty into US economic policy. Who can plan investment with any certainty when the price of key inputs can double on the whim of an irrational ignoramus? And if the goal of the tariffs remains both to generate massive revenue to fund Trump\u2019s tax cuts and force the onshoring of all manufacturing to the US in a form of modern-day autarky, where will the US get the skilled workers needed, given Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4%? Certainly not migration \u2014 under Trump, the US is now overly hostile to visitors of any kind, let alone people who might want to consider offering their skills to US employers. He also seems to have undermined, at least for the medium term, confidence in the safe haven status of the US and its bonds, which is what caused the initial tariff backflip last week. The Federal Reserve (hated by Trump because of its independence) stepped in on Friday with well-timed comments aimed at bond market investors. Boston Fed president Susan Collins told the Financial Times that the US central bank would \u201cabsolutely be prepared\u201d to deploy its various tools to help stabilise the financial markets if the need arose. You know confidence in US bonds and the country\u2019s credit worthiness is shot when a senior member of the Fed has to go public to emphasise that the central bank will be there to clean up the mess Trump is making. But Treasury yields remained elevated over the weekend at 4.482%, reflecting that Trump\u2019s volatility is materially adding to the risk of what was until recently the crucial safe haven of global finance.

Cell C is the fourth-largest mobile network operator in South Africa, , after Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom. The company founded in 2001 offers prepaid and postpaid mobile plans, data bundles and internet services, fiber broadband, roaming and international calling, SIM-only plans and device deals. Cell C has confirmed a data breach following a RansomHouse cyberattack that occurred last year. The ransomware group has since leaked the stolen data on its dark web leak site. The gang claimed the theft of 2 TB of data. Compromised data includes full names, contact details, ID numbers, banking information, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical records and passport details. Cell C stated that threat actors gained unauthorized access to some of its IT systems. \u201cCell C is aware that data compromised in the recent cybersecurity incident has been unlawfully disclosed by RansomHouse, the threat actor claiming responsibility.\u201d states the company . \u201cThis follows a previously reported incident involving unauthorised access to unstructured data in some parts of our IT environment.\u201d Cell C has taken swift action to contain a recent cyberattack, secure its systems, and limit the impact. The company engaged top cybersecurity and forensic experts, informed authorities, and is actively supporting affected stakeholders. They continue to monitor for potential data misuse and urge vigilance against fraud, phishing, and identity theft. Cell C has also shared fraud prevention resources, including guidance on registering with SAFPS for extra protection. RansomHouse is a data extortion group that has been active since Dec 2021. Unlike other extortion group, the gang doesn\u2019t encrypt data, but focuses on data theft to speed up its activity. Victims include AMD and Keralty. They shame non-payers by leaking data. Backups are insufficient; IPS is recommended for protection. American hospitals are a privileged target for threat actors due to the huge trove of sensitive data they manage. Ransomware attacks on U.S. healthcare providers surged in 2024, with 98 attacks compromising 117 million records . Hospitals often face system lockdowns, forcing a switch to manual processes. High-profile breaches include Change Healthcare (100M records), Summit Pathology (1.8M), OnePoint Patient Care (796K), and Boston Children\u2019s Health Physicians (909K). In 2023, Loretto Hospital experienced another data security incident . On January 19, 2023, a former employee misappropriated security camera footage of a limited number of patients and posted it on Facebook. The footage was removed after the incident was discovered. Loretto identified the impacted individuals and notified them by mail on March 15, 2023, offering guidance on protecting their information. The exposed information consisted of security camera footage of a small number of patients.

Much attention has focused on the mag seven\u2019s growing influence on index returns, given they account for 30 per cent of the S&P 500\u2032s market capitalisation and 17 per cent of the MSCI All-Cap World Index\u2019s (ACWI).

Not only are the mega-caps bigger than most stocks, they\u2019re also more volatile. As a result, the mag seven account for 40-45 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 25 per cent of ACWI volatility. The gap between the volatility contribution and their market-cap weight is now the widest in 25 years. Looking more closely, Verdad\u2019s figures show Tesla has as much impact on US and global index movements as Microsoft , even though Microsoft is more than three times as valuable. However, the main contributor to investor heartburn is Nvidia. Even though it\u2019s less valuable than Apple and Microsoft, it is responsible for 13 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 8 per cent of the ACWI\u2019s \u2013 more than twice as much as Apple and Microsoft.

However, it\u2019d be even better if Elon focused more on striking closer to the root of the problem: the public\u2019s economic ignorance from which all the disastrous, coercive, competition-immune, monopolistic government central planning, spending, and also warmongering grows. This is precisely what Ludwig von Mises did, and I like to call it the \u201cMisesian formula\u201d for prosperity. Mises devoted parts of his majestic treatise Human Action (1949) to the formula. In a section aptly titled \u201cEconomics and the Citizen,\u201d Mises writes : 5-Minute Core Exercise... Dzenitis, Tami Brehse Best Price: $3.81 Buy New $8.68 (as of 03:36 UTC - Details ) Economics must not be relegated to classrooms and statistical offices and must not be left to esoteric circles. It is the philosophy of human life and action and concerns everybody and everything. It is the pith of civilization and of man\u2019s human existence\u2026. All present-day political issues concern problems commonly called economic. All arguments advanced in contemporary discussion of social and public affairs deal with fundamental matters of\u2026economics. Everybody\u2019s mind is preoccupied with economic doctrines\u2026. Everybody thinks of economics whether he is aware of it or not. In joining a political party and in casting his ballot, the citizen implicitly takes a stand upon essential economic theories\u2026. As conditions are today, nothing can be more important to every intelligent man than economics. His own fate and that of his progeny is at stake\u2026. \u2026all reasonable men are called upon to familiarize themselves with the teachings of economics. This is, in our age, the primary civic duty. Whether we like it or not, it is a fact that economics cannot remain an esoteric branch of knowledge accessible only to small groups of scholars and specialists. Economics deals with society\u2019s fundamental problems; it concerns everyone and belongs to all. It is the main and proper study of every citizen. Since it\u2019s real freedom and capitalism that lead to prosperity, explaining this to people is, per Mises, \u201c the primary civic duty .\u201d Riding the wave of economic education, Javier Milei had been spearheading on his way to electoral triumph in Argentina, on November 8, 2023 Elon tweeted a Hayek meme writing: \u201cBest economist ever.\u201d A week later, on December 4, he tweeted , \u201cGreat book by Hayek\u201d while linking to Hayek\u2019s classic book The Road To Serfdom , and another meme quoting Hayek : \u201cnothing could contribute more to the cure of humanity\u2019s ills than to give people a better understanding of economics .\u201d Elon is thus increasingly aware of the need to educate, but still far from having a Misesian ethos-understanding. Mankind\u2019s problems are overwhelmingly the result of the public\u2019s economic ignorance which then, via democracy, manifests itself in the order-destroying bureaucracies. It is their ignorance\u2014that of your neighbor, family members, and likely former self\u2014that is near the root of the problem, not whatever homo sapiens people vote for. The very root of this economic ignorance, as significantly shown by founder of the \u201cAustrian School of Economics,\u201d Carl Menger, is the fact that money (and its vital emerging benefits like profit-loss calculation), trade, the division of labor, economic competition, etc. are\u2014to borrow Adam Ferguson\u2019s popular phrase \u2014\u201cindeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design.\u201d Hardly anyone, and much less people of significant influence, likely including Elon, are aware of this. One of my favorite little-known Libertarian books is Walter Block\u2019s I Chose Liberty: Autobiographies of Contemporary Libertarians , which contains over 80 autobiographical essays-interviews of leading libertarians/free marketeers like Walter himself, Ron Paul, Lew Rockwell, Peter Boettke, etc., describing how they became libertarians/free marketeers. It is easy to see how many of them went from being ignorant big government, socialist myth-believers to champions of freedom and emerging civilization, by stumbling upon sound economics. Mises (1881-1973) died long before the collapse of the Soviet Union (1991) and pro-capitalist reforms in China, thus he spent his lifetime fighting a losing intellectual battle, as socialist myths expanded their control of more countries. He writes : From time to time I entertained the hope that my writings would bear practical fruit and point policy in the right direction. I have always looked for evidence of a change in ideology. But I never actually deceived myself; my theories explain, but cannot slow the decline of a great civilization. I set out to be a reformer, but only became the historian of decline. After WWI, he carried the same determination in his Atlas-like intellectual-educational efforts: How one carries on in the face of unavoidable catastrophe is a matter of temperament\u2026. Again and again I had met with situations from which rational deliberation found no means of escape; but then the unexpected intervened, and with it came salvation. I would not lose courage even now. I wanted to do everything an economist could do. I would not tire in saying what I knew to be true. Mises again , in Human Action : \u2026in the field of social organization and economic policies. Here the best theories are useless if not supported by public opinion. They cannot work if not accepted by a majority of the people. Whatever the system of government may be, there cannot be any question of ruling a nation lastingly on the ground of doctrines at variance with public opinion. In the end the philosophy of the majority prevails. In the long run there cannot be any such thing as an unpopular system of government\u2026. The supremacy of public opinion determines not only the singular role that economics occupies in the complex of thought and knowledge. It determines the whole process of human history\u2026. \u2026great men cannot succeed in adjusting social conditions to their plans if they do not convince public opinion. The flowering of human society depends on two factors: the intellectual power of outstanding men to conceive sound social and economic theories, and the ability of these or other men to make these ideologies palatable to the majority. Mises\u2019s wisdom above predicts what is happening to Elon and his DOGE, and again highlights the need to \u201cconvince public opinion.\u201d Although Elon has gained support from many, a large percentage of the economically-ignorant public is increasingly, fanatically against Elon\u2019s efforts. Bolshevik-like, intellectually dangerous ideologues like Robert Reich have been constantly spewing anti-economics and violence-inducing class-warfare rhetoric. For example, on March 12, 2025, Reich wrote in Facebook: Elon Musk is trying to steal the federal government \u2014 slashing public services, firing civil servants, and handing power to billionaires like himself. I salute the brave public servants who are resisting this coup. This type of mindset by the economically ignorant masses have made Musk one of the most hated men in America, to be destroyed via lawfare and even physical violence. From January 29 to March 10, 2025, there have been 9 attacks on Tesla locations . On March 10, X/Twitter suffered a relatively massive outage which, at the time, Elon felt originated in Ukraine, showing the potential dangers of being against the interests of millions vested in neocon warfare. I would not be surprised if SpaceX and Tesla are already\u2014or will eventually be\u2014victims of internal sabotage. Statistically, as the anti-Elon dice keep getting rolled at an increasing rate, he will likely be brought down somehow. Besides, as Vincent Cook\u2019s article \u201c Is DOGE a Dog When It Comes to Real Federal Spending? \u201d shows, there are too many legal obligations for DOGE to make significant cuts. Elon is attacking the symptoms of economic ignorance, not the root causes like Mises did. With a more Misesian intellectual background and educational strategy, Javier Milei\u2014similar to Ron Paul\u2014managed to educate enough people to win the presidency of Argentina. In an interview with Ben Shapiro, Milei explained how the intellectual revolution grew from economic education: The Next Civil War: Di... Marche, Stephen Best Price: $10.12 Buy New $13.64 (as of 10:51 UTC - Details ) This time young people were really educated. We would organize what we called the concerts. They were political rallies\u2026 At these rallies we had stands\u2026with books. Minister Bullrich\u2026said something brilliant, \u201cyou should pay more attention to what Milei is doing. It\u2019s not normal for a politician to be talking to 20 or 30 thousand people about Hayek.\u201d Young people started to evangelize at home with their parents and grandparents. Mises wrote : Liberalism is rationalistic. It maintains that it is possible to convince the immense majority\u2026 It has full confidence in man\u2019s reason. It may be that this optimism is unfounded and that the liberals have erred. But then there is no hope left for mankind\u2019s future. In other words, we must believe that we can educate \u201cthe immense majority,\u201d and thus act accordingly, even if it proves to be futile, otherwise \u201cthere is no hope left for mankind\u2019s future.\u201d Mises concludes Human Action : The body of economic knowledge is an essential element in the structure of human civilization; it is the foundation upon which modern industrialism and all the moral, intellectual, technological, and therapeutical achievements of the last centuries have been built. It rests with men whether they will make the proper use of the rich treasure with which this knowledge provides them or whether they will leave it unused. But if they fail to take the best advantage of it and disregard its teachings and warnings, they will not annul economics; they will stamp out society and the human race. Note : The views expressed on Mises.org are not necessarily those of the Mises Institute.

Learn More A year before global markets were upended by President Trump's tariffs, Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned shareholders of the rising threat of China's electric vehicle makers. In Tesla's Q4 earnings call on January 24, 2024, Mr Musk said: The Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. I think they will have significant success outside of China depending on what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established. Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world. They are extremely good. I'm aware this story could go in many directions from here. But I'll focus on China's biggest EV maker, its rising dominance, and the implications for ASX lithium shares . Last week, I wrote a story that looked at whether or not the plunging lithium price had finally hit the bottom . A key factor that will determine where the price of lithium will go from here is demand, particularly Chinese demand. The latest Resources and Energy Quarterly report states that global lithium demand is forecast to grow by almost 13% a year to 2030. A closer look reveals forecasts of increased demand for lithium are largely based on expectations of increased uptake of electric vehicles and battery energy storage systems. And BYD , which has now overtaken Tesla to become the biggest supplier of EVs in the world, will play a significant part in fuelling that demand. In 2024, more than 90% of Australia's lithium exports were shipped to China, and the Middle Kingdom's appetite for lithium shows no sign of slowing down. Chinese demand for lithium is set to rise as the biggest player in the EV space continues to expand despite tariff implications. In 2024, BYD reported that it had delivered 4.24 million vehicles, up from around 3 million the previous year. Charging ahead BYD is now selling almost as many vehicles as Ford, an astonishing feat for a company that has been around for only 30 years. This year, the company is projecting that it will deliver about 5.5 million EVs. It's likely that President Trump's tariffs will do little to slow BYD's rising dominance in the electric vehicle market. BYD's biggest market is China, where rising adoption rates of electric vehicles contributed to global EV sales growth of 26% last year. Other key markets for BYD include Europe, South America, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Australia. And momentum is continuing into 2025 and beyond. Analysts at JPMorgan have raised their estimate for BYD's vehicle deliveries for 2026 to 6.5 million units. As BYD continues its astronomical growth path, it will have a material impact on global lithium demand. I'm not suggesting that all this means that the price of lithium has hit the floor. But it does seem clear that the signs do point to a more optimistic outlook for ASX-listed lithium players, including Pilbara Minerals Ltd ( ASX: PLS ), Minerals Resources Ltd ( ASX: MIN ), and Liontown Resources Ltd ( ASX: LTR ).

The Chinese government is drafting a new regulatory system for exports, and while the policies are being framed, the shipments of the magnets, essential for the manufacturing of almost everything ranging from cars to missiles, have been halted at many Chinese ports, according to a report by The New York Times. Per the report, once the new regulatory system is in place, it could permanently prevent supplies from reaching certain companies, including American military contractors. US Dependency On Chinese Imports The official crackdown on exports is part of Beijing's retaliation against US President Trump's punishing trade war. China produces around 90 per cent of the world's rare earths, a group of 17 elements used across the defense, electric vehicle, energy and electronics industries. Seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, including samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium-related items, have been placed on the export control list. The United States has only one rare earths mine, and most of its supply comes from China. Beijing placed export restrictions on rare earth elements on April 2 as part of a broader package of tariffs and company restrictions in retaliation for Trump's decision to hike tariffs against most Chinese products to 54 per cent. The export curbs include not only mined minerals but permanent magnets and other finished products that will be difficult to replace, analysts said. The move, which Beijing had long hinted was possible, further ratchets up trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and leaves American manufacturers scrambling for fresh supplies of the critical minerals they have relied upon for decades. Now, metals and special magnets made with them can only be shipped out of China with special export licenses, the NYT report said. However, Beijing's system to issue these licenses is barely in place, which is causing consternation among industry executives that the process could drag on and that current supplies of minerals and products outside of China could run low. A Move To Exert Dominance The move, which affects exports to all countries, not just the US, is the latest demonstration of China's ability to weaponize its dominance over the mining and processing of the critical minerals. While the export controls stop short of an outright ban, Beijing can throttle shipments by restricting the number of export licenses it issues. Lockheed Martin, Tesla and Apple are among the US companies that use Chinese rare earths in their supply chains. The US government has stockpiles of some rare earths, but not enough to supply its defense contractors in perpetuity. Beijing has already imposed outright bans on the export of three metals to the US and slapped export controls on many others. The moves to restrict heavy rare earths are especially important because China has even tighter control over these elements, David Merriman at consultancy Project Blue, told Reuters. \"There is currently only one HREE (heavy rare earth element) focused operation outside of China, Myanmar and Laos,\" he said, adding that China has close involvement in supply chains from Myanmar and Laos. Why Rare Metals Are Important For The US The heavy rare earth metals put under export suspension by China are used in magnets-- essential for many kinds of electric motors used in the manufacturing of electric cars, drones, robots, missiles and spacecraft and gasoline-powered cars. These metals are required for the manufacturing of jet engines, lasers, car headlights and certain spark plugs and capacitors, which are electrical components of the computer chips that power artificial intelligence servers and smartphones.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The US and China remain mired in a seemingly never-ending bout of one-upmanship, characterized by tit-for-tat trade levies and strategic export bans, which, in the case of the US, revolve around semiconductors, while China has now flexed its own muscles by restricting the export of rare earth metals. In this highly volatile situation, a Tesla patent from 2023 could be the answer to the conundrum of de-risking America's supply chains, at least where rare earth metals are concerned.

In contrast to the commonly held view, the US can't just start refining its own copious rare earth resources at the flip of a switch, for such a feat requires an intricate interplay of massive funding, energy, infrastructure, and vertically integrated supply chain partners. While the US can certainly establish its own rare earth domain, it would likely require the better part of a decade. Slitted Magnet for Selective Coercivity: Tesla's Novel Approach to Rare Earth Metal Reduction @Tesla 's WO2024097176A1 patent introduces an innovative magnet manufacturing technique that transforms electric vehicle motor production through strategic cavity-based doping. By\u2026 pic.twitter.com/tZcaJ03OPG \u2014 SETI Park (@seti_park) December 4, 2024 So, what's the solution in the interim? Well, one idea centers around significantly reducing the use of rare earth metals in key industrial processes, and Tesla might offer one such avenue worth pursuing. To wit, in a patent filed back in 2023, bearing the international publication number WO2024097176A1 , Tesla describes a 'keyhole surgery-like process' to significantly reduce the need for rare earth metals in the manufacturing process of electric motors. The process involves the creation of \"controlled-depth cavities (0.2-1.5mm wide) in magnet structure,\" which then allow for the introduction of specific dopants. According to the patent, the process achieves desired magnetic properties while significantly reducing rare earth metal usage and manufacturing complexity. Of course, it remains unclear if Tesla is using this approach in its gigafactories, and to what extent. However, the approach does stand out for its simplicity and, therefore, could constitute a viable avenue for de-risking America's intertwined supply chains.

But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry's everyday workers have remained liberal - but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. AP Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy. The only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump 's first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company's Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google's co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them. Last weekend was Lyons' second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel. The man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley's environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration. To Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what's happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays. Live Events \"One of the things I've seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,\" Lyons said.

But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry's everyday workers have remained liberal - but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology. \"I think you're seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,\" said Ann Skeet, who helps run a center at Santa Clara University studying the ethics of the tech industry. \"The shift hasn't been for a lot of people,\" said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. \"It's a handful of people who've gotten the attention.\" The biggest example of that is Elon Musk, the world's richest person and CEO of the world's best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump's administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump's campaign and became the White House 's artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump's inauguration in Washington. Zuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him. Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors. Trump has filled a number of his administration's posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites. During Trump's first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe. It's against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk . Even as tech industry has changed, Silicon Valley has leaned Democratic Santa Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California. Even with that swing, the county voted 68% to 28% for the then-vice president and remains a Democratic stronghold. \"We're still in the belly of the beast,\" said Dave Johnson, the new executive director of the Santa Clara GOP, who said the party has gained some new members in the county but few from the tech industry. \"If the lake was frozen, there's a little glimmer on top. I would not say there are cracks in the ice.\" The valley has long leaned Democratic, but with an unusual political mix: a general dislike of getting too involved in Washington's business coupled with an at-times contradictory mix of libertarian individualism, Bay Area activism and belief in the ability of science to solve the world's problems. That has persisted even as the tech industry has changed. The tech boom was fueled by scrappy startups that catered to their workers' dreams of changing the world for the better. Google's motto was \"don't be evil,\" a phrase it removed from its code of conduct by 2018, when it and other companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had grown into multinational behemoths. The companies have had layoffs in recent years, a shock to an industry that not long ago seemed poised for unlimited growth. Entrepreneurs once dreamed of building startups that would change the world, said Jan English-Lueck, a San Jose State University professor who has been studying Silicon Valley culture for more than 20 years. \"Now,\" she said, \"if you're part of a startup, you're hoping you'll be absorbed in a way that's profitable.\" Discontent among some in the tech industry about where it's headed Even before some prominent tech leaders shifted toward Trump, there was mounting discontent among some in the industry over its direction. IdaRose Sylvester runs a business promoting a Silicon Valley-style approach to entrepreneurs in other countries. \"I feel sick to my stomach now,\" she said. Sylvester was already disenchanted with the growing inequality in the valley and the environmental cost of all the energy needed to power crypto, AI and data centers. She took part in protests against Trump in 2017, but felt that energy fade once he lost the 2020 election to Biden. \"I saw a lot of people get out of politics once Biden won. There was a feeling it was all OK,\" Sylvester said. \"It was not all OK.\" It is worse now, she said. She helped organize one of several demonstrations across the valley last weekend during a national day of protests against the new administration. At first glance, the one in downtown San Jose could have been a typical anti-Trump protest anywhere. A large crowd of largely middle-age and older people carried signs against the president and Musk while chanting against oligarchs. But it was clearly a Silicon Valley crowd, one still reeling not only from Trump's challenges to the country's system of checks and balances but also from the actions of the valley's top executives. \"The money is all shifting to the wealthiest, and that terrifies me,\" said Dianne Wood, who works at a startup. \"Unfortunately, you've got the Zuckerbergs and Elon Musks of the world who are taking that over.\" \"Just coming here, everyone's saying turn off the facial recognition on your phone,\" Wood added. \"We're all scared.\" Kamal Ali, who works in AI, said he felt betrayed by that shift. \"The trust is broken. A lot of employees are very upset by what's going on,\" he said. \"It's going to be different forever.\" Read More News on trump silicon valley zuckerbergs white house trump and musk santa clara university Google Read More News on trump silicon valley zuckerbergs white house trump and musk santa clara university Google Prime Exclusives Investment Ideas Stock Report Plus ePaper Wealth Edition Asian Paints is trading at P/E lower than pandemic levels.

Valuation correction: If the round goes through, the Kunal Shah-led Cred may become one of the first major fintechs to raise venture funding at a markdown from its 2022 peak. Despite steady revenue growth and positive cash flow, sources said Cred\u2019s decision to pursue a down round reflects broader market realities. Between 2021 and 2022, the startup\u2019s valuation jumped from $3.4 billion to $6.4 billion in a year\u2019s time. Global fintech reset: Silicon Valley-based payments giant Stripe slashed its valuation from a 2021 peak of $95 billion to $50 billion last year . Earlier this year, Stripe disclosed that investors purchased employee shares through a tender offer at a $91.5 billion valuation. Swedish fintech firm Klarna saw its valuation plunge from $46 billion to $6.7 billion. Having delayed its IPO, Klarna now aims for a valuation above $15 billion when it eventually lists . Pushing growth: The fresh capital would help Cred accelerate growth across its business lines spanning lending, insurance, ecommerce and digital payments. Part of the funding may also bolster its lending arm, Newtap Finance, which aims to play a larger role in Cred's expanding financial services portfolio.

Funding woes: The company's monthly cash burn exceeds Rs 20 crore, prompting the decision to wind down its core operations. Earlier this year, a $50 million fundraising effort collapsed after existing investors refused to inject fresh capital. Financial troubles have deepened due to a debt crisis at Gensol Engineering, a firm backed by BluSmart founders Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. This has further constrained access to funds for the ride-hailing business. What else: Once BluSmart\u2019s vehicles are listed on Uber, the startup will receive a share of fare revenues while Uber retains its standard commission\u2014just as it does with other fleet operators or individual driver partners. Leadership exodus: Several senior BluSmart executives have recently stepped down, including fleet CEO Anirudh Arun, chief technology officer Rishabh Sood, and chief business officer Tushar Garg, formerly of Uber India.

Driving the news: Bumrah\u2019s move reflects a broader trend of celebrities looking beyond traditional brand endorsements to make business investments. In recent years, cricketers such as Sachin Tendulkar, MS Dhoni, and Hardik Pandya have increasingly invested in businesses or launched their own ventures. Investment details: Sudip Ghose, founder of Uppercase, revealed that the company will collaborate with Bumrah to develop a new line of products, including luggage, backpacks, and gym bags, designed primarily for athletes. Bumrah will receive a share of the profits from these items.

Trump\u2019s Commerce Secretary: Electronics tariff exemptions are temporary, chip tariffs coming soon The goods will soon fall under a new semiconductor-specific tariff policy, likely within two months By AP- PTI Updated - April 14, 2025 at 07:33 AM. | Nashville US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. The ongoing ambiguity has rattled markets, especially Big Tech firms like Apple and Nvidia, with experts warning of severe disruption to supply chains and investor confidence. | Photo Credit: NATHAN HOWARD/Reuters Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey're exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they're included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. President Donald Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no \u201cexception\u201d at all because the goods are \u201cjust moving to a different\" bucket and will still face a 20 per cent tariff as part of his administration's move to punish China for its role in fentanyl trafficking. Also read Apple India produces $22 billion of iPhones in shift from China The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren't usually made in the US The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. US Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won't be subject to most of the tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. Also read Apple airlifts 600 tonnes of iPhones from India to beat Trump tariffs, sources say It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was \u201ctaking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d Some had assumed the exemption filed Friday night reflected the president's realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the US any time soon, if ever. The administration has predicted that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. Also read Semiconductors from China under US scrutiny as Trump warns of fresh tariffs What's more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the US, and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. The turmoil has battered the stocks of tech's \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven's combined market value had plunged by USD2.1 trillion, or 14 per cent, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to USD 644 billion, or a 4 per cent decline. An electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech's hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden's administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump's first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. Comments Published on April 14, 2025 READ MORE THIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM. SUBSCRIBE FOR MINIMAL ADS. THIS AD SUPPORTS OUR JOURNALISM. SUBSCRIBE FOR MINIMAL ADS.

New Yorkers revolt against \u2018toxic\u2019 new neighborhood battery storage facilities as backlash grows to green energy law NY Post ^ | April 13, 2025, 5:22 p.m. ET | y Dorian Geiger, Hannah Fierick and Carl Campanile Posted on 04/13/2025 4:25:43 PM PDT by BenLurkin New Yorkers are lining up in opposition to dozens of new lithium-ion battery storage facilities planned across the Big Apple and beyond, over fears they could spark toxic infernos in residential neighborhoods. Queens Councilman Robert Holden said he doesn\u2019t want his neighborhood to turn into a potential \u201cmini-Chernobyl\u201d The site, which is now vacant at 64-30 69th Place, stands next to a daycare and preschool (Books & Rattles, Inc.), the Juniper Valley Animal Hospital and also lies across the street from PS 128. NineDot Energy spokesperson Karen Alter, when contacted by The Post, said the Brooklyn-based firm had not made a \u201cfinal decision on moving forward.\u201d In a copy of emails with community officials obtained by The Post, NineDot rep Sam Brill defended the safety of such battery sites, including a NineDot battery facility in the Bronx, that for years has \u201csafely operated\u201d 40 feet from a public school. \u201cFDNY wouldn\u2019t let us build these if they weren\u2019t safe,\u201d Brill said.

Archive Magazine Save this story Save Save this story Save The wealthiest man in the world, Elon Musk , celebrated on his social media site X late Friday, writing that the \u201cpronoun bs is finally going away.\u201d \u201cThat was silly,\u201d Musk, who heads up the Department of Government Efficiency and has been slashing crucial federal funding for months, wrote after reposting a pronoun knock-knock joke. \u201cThank god Trump won,\u201d a user named TheDogeGlory replied below Musk\u2019s post, to which he responded with a bullseye emoji. Musk\u2019s post comes days after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that administration officials would refrain from responding to inquiries from journalists who include their preferred pronouns in email signatures or bios. \u201cAs a matter of policy,\u201d Leavitt wrote in an email from a reporter asking about the closure of a research observatory , \u201cwe do not respond to reporters with pronouns in their bios.\u201d SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk arrives on stage at an America PAC town hall on October 26, 2024 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Samuel Corum/Getty Images President Donald Trump \u2019s administration, in January, instructed federal employees to remove any reference to their identifying pronouns from their email signatures and other forms as a part of the broad effort to roll back any and all evidence of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Or, as a Texas state employee found out , get fired. Leavitt\u2019s admission this week confirms that the press office is following suit. \u201cAny reporter who chooses to put their preferred pronouns in their bio clearly does not care about biological reality or truth and therefore cannot be trusted to write an honest story,\u201d the press secretary, who in just a few short months since Trump has taken office has gained a reputation as combative toward both individual journalists and legacy media in general, said in a separate statement to other news outlets. Axios also confirmed on Wednesday that officials will continue to skirt these reporters, asking Trump spokesperson Harrison Fields if that was now their official policy. \u201cFACTS!\u201d he replied. As The New York Times reported this week, \u201cOn at least three recent occasions, senior Trump press aides have refused to engage with reporters\u2019 questions because the journalists listed identifying pronouns in their email signatures.\u201d A spokesperson for the Times said, \u201cEvading tough questions certainly runs counter to transparent engagement with free and independent press reporting.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d they continued, \u201crefusing to answer a straightforward request to explain the administration\u2019s policies because of the formatting of an email signature is both a concerning and baffling choice, especially from the highest press office in the U.S. government.\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks during the daily briefing in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 25, 2025. JIM WATSON/Getty Images In one instance, Matt Berg , a reporter at Crooked Media, the network that runs the \u201cPod Save America\u201d family of podcasts, decided to experiment with the new administration\u2019s handling of journalists who include their pronouns. Berg doesn\u2019t usually include pronouns in his email signature. But, when he included \u201che/him\u201d in an email to Katie Miller , a senior adviser at DOGE, he too was met with a response claiming that the use of pronouns is detrimental to science, that it was her policy to refuse to respond to journalists with listed pronouns, and that he was ignoring facts. \u201cI find it baffling that they care more about pronouns than giving journalists accurate information, but here we are,\u201d Berg said in an email to the Times . The press office has previously been harsh on reporters who do not use the language they prefer. In February, Leavitt and the administration blocked The Associated Press from covering multiple White House events because it refused to change its editorial style from \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d to \u201cGulf of America.\u201d The AP sued Leavitt and two other White House officials on First Amendment grounds and won\u2014though the White House said it would be appealing. Dozens of protesters gather in Times Square near a military recruitment center to show their anger at President Donald Trump's decision to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals from serving in the military on July 26, 2017 in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images The White House\u2019s handling of pronouns aligns with the president\u2019s coordinated rollback of protections for transgender and nonbinary Americans and those who support them. Trump has signed several executive orders targeting transgender people. In his first moments in office, the president signed an order declaring that the United States would only recognize two sexes, \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale,\u201d as defined at conception\u2014a move that required government agencies to use an outdated and scientifically inaccurate gender binary on documents like passports, visas, and employee records. He also signed others aimed at barring transgender student athletes from playing on girls\u2019 sports teams, restricting funding for gender-affirming care for people under 19, and removing transgender service members from the military. Multiple of Trump\u2019s orders against transgender people are being challenged in the courts. For Musk, this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s discussed preferred pronouns on X, formerly Twitter. In 2022, he wrote , \u201cMy pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci.\u201d And in June of 2023, on the first day of Pride Month, Musk said he would allow users to intentionally misgender someone without consequence. He also claimed that he personally would use the pronouns that someone prefers for manners\u2019 sake\u2014something he has repeatedly chosen not to do with his own daughter .

Agencies Confidential internal documents leaked following a cyberattack on NetJets, the private aviation firm owned by Berkshire Hathaway. They have reportedly exposed a detailed in-flight service guide tailored exclusively for Elon Musk on private jets, offering rare insight into the billionaire\u2019s airborne lifestyle, as per a report by Bloomberg. The document, first reported by Bloomberg, provides flight attendants with precise instructions on how to cater to the personal and professional preferences of the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, reflecting the meticulous attention given to his comfort and routine while in transit. Speed, Silence and Solitude: Inside the Jet Cabin According to the hacked manual, Elon Musk prefers direct and rapid routes regardless of fuel efficiency, a somewhat paradoxical position for the head of an electric vehicle empire known for sustainability. \u201cMr. Musk isn\u2019t interested in conserving fuel,\u201d the memo states, noting that his priority is to \u201cfly as quickly and as direct as possible.\u201d Live Events Onboard, the environment is kept controlled to Musk\u2019s liking: a cool cabin temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit, dimmed lighting, and passenger vents turned off due to his aversion to background noise. Unexpected Wi-Fi dropouts are to be avoided at all costs, and staff are advised not to offer unsolicited help with technology, as Musk considers himself \u201cself-sufficient.\u201d Gaming in the Sky: Musk\u2019s Late-Night Livestreams Beyond the logistics of luxury travel, Musk has been using his time in the air to test Starlink\u2019s airborne connectivity, streaming video games from his private jet to millions of viewers. In a recent livestream that attracted over 16 million views, Musk played for 44 minutes, occasionally commenting on topics ranging from turbulence and artificial intelligence to the upcoming season of \"Diablo IV.\" Speaking into the camera in the early hours of April 10, he reflected on personal challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of a stressful week, frankly. But today was a good day,\u201d Musk said, moments before resuming gameplay. These livestreams, often broadcast under his alias @cyb3rgam3r420, have become a regular feature of his travel routine, even showing glimpses of his son or spontaneous thoughts about Roman military history or Tesla\u2019s future tech ventures. Gaming Under Scrutiny Despite the casual tone of these videos, Musk has faced criticism within the gaming community. A previous exchange with a YouTuber, NikoWrex, suggested Musk may have considered \"account boosting\" \u2014 a controversial practice where gamers pay others to improve their rankings. The allegation drew ire from gamers and even prompted snark from official game accounts. Musk, while never officially commenting on the claims, did amplify the video in question. However, critics argue that his recent \u201chardcore mode\u201d failures during livestreams \u2014 including multiple in-game deaths and connection issues \u2014 cast doubt on his self-professed gaming prowess. FAQs What was leaked in the NetJets cyberattack? Internal documents from NetJets, a private aviation company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, were leaked following a cyberattack. These include a confidential service guide specifically tailored for Elon Musk, offering detailed insight into his travel preferences and routines aboard private jets. What does the guide reveal about Elon Musk\u2019s travel preferences? Musk prefers fast, direct flights regardless of fuel efficiency. He also requires a cabin temperature of 65\u00b0F, dim lighting, and no use of passenger air vents to reduce background noise. Flight attendants are instructed not to offer tech assistance unless asked.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other AI stocks catching Wall Street\u2019s attention. In the latest development in the feud between OpenAI and Elon Musk, the ChatGPT maker has countersued billionaire Musk, citing a pattern of harassment. The company also asked a federal judge to stop Musk from any \u201cfurther unlawful and unfair action\u201d against OpenAI in a court case over the company\u2019s future structure that has fueled the AI revolution. OpenAI claims that Musk has tried \u201cnonstop\u201d to slow down its business for his benefit, accusing him of using \u201cbad-faith tactics\u201d against it to help him control AI technology. Musk has been actively seeking to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a \u201cfor-profit\u201d company, claiming that the transition will be a bad idea, which prioritizes commercial interests and compromises its mission of benefiting humanity. OpenAI, however, denies these allegations. The company must complete its transition by the end of the year if it seeks to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round. If the transition fails to complete by year-end, the funding will likely be reduced to US$20 billion.

This bid was rejected by OpenAI. \u201cHad OpenAI\u2019s Board genuinely considered the bid as they were obligated to do they would have seen how serious it was. It\u2019s telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI\u2019s assets allegedly \u2018interferes\u2019 with their business plans.\u201d For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Tesla, Inc. (TSLA): AI Vision Versus EV Weakness - Goldman Balances Long-Term Hopes with Near-Term Risks Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA ) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126 Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that leverages advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On April 10, Goldman Sachs reiterated the stock as \u201cNeutral\u201d and cut its price target on the stock to $260 per share from $275. \u201cFor Tesla , we believe that weaker auto demand/consumer sentiment, tariff costs (including in Energy), and US EV policy risk are offset by longer-term potential from its AI related efforts;\u201d Overall, TSLA ranks 8th on our list of AI stocks catching Wall Street\u2019s attention. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16. Review the configuration of all devices.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Recommended Videos The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broadly. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. The electronics exemption is the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies \u2014 including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \u2014 who are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

Elon Musk. Elon Musk has been steadily losing popularity among Americans, according to claims made by pollster Nate Silver in his latest tracker. However, Silver's assessment has drawn sharp retort from Tesla CEO Musk who blasted the ratings as \"political propaganda war\". \"We just launched an Elon Musk popularity tracker to accompany our Trump approval tracker. Currently, he's at a \u221214 as compared with Trump's \u22125,\" Silver posted on Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter). Replying to Silver's tweet, Musk wrote, \"The inevitable outcome of having a political propaganda war waged against me while I have almost no countervailing campaign and, at times, digging my own grave way better than my enemies do.\" Silver \"Do Americans have a favorable or unfavorable view of Elon Musk\" tracker shows statistics from January 1, 2024 till April 1, 2025. The timeline comprises Musk's endorsement for then Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump, US President elections, and Donald Trump's inauguration and subsequent decisions that Trump administration has taken. Earlier on Thursday, two U.S. House of Representatives lawmakers on Thursday asked the Transportation Department's top ethics official to detail how the agency is addressing Elon Musk's potential conflicts of interest given ongoing investigations of SpaceX and Tesla, companies run by the close ally of President Donald Trump. Live Events Meanwhile, Ireland's data privacy watchdog said on Friday it's investigating Elon Musk's social media platform X over its use of personal data to train his artificial intelligence chatbot Grok. The Data Protection Commission said it has opened an inquiry into \"the processing of personal data comprised in publicly-accessible posts\" that European users posted on X. FAQs Q1.

In a bold interview with EFN, Gardell called Tesla\u2019s valuation \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and pointed to slowing sales, Elon Musk\u2019s political drama, and Cybertruck struggles as red flags. While Tesla leads in EV innovation, Gardell warns the bubble could soon burst. Swedish billionaire Christer Gardell warns Tesla stock may crash 95%. He says the valuation is unrealistic and linked to Elon Musk\u2019s controversies, falling sales, and Cybertruck struggles Swedish billionaire and hedge fund manager Christer Gardell has issued a stark warning that\u2019s now catching the attention of Tesla investors worldwide. According to Gardell, Tesla\u2019s market valuation is \u201cincomprehensible\u201d and could plummet by up to 95% \u2014 and possibly sooner than many might expect. In a recent interview with Swedish finance channel EFN, Gardell didn\u2019t hold back. He pointed to a mix of slowing sales, rising controversy around CEO Elon Musk, and what he sees as wildly overinflated stock value. Why is Christer Gardell calling Tesla\u2019s valuation a ticking time bomb? Tesla's current market value sits in the hundreds of billions of dollars. But Gardell, who runs activist hedge fund Cevian Capital, says that figure doesn\u2019t align with Tesla\u2019s core business. \u201cTesla, especially now with the whole Musk circus going on everywhere, is probably the most expensive stock on the global stock exchanges right now,\u201d Gardell said in the EFN interview, as reported by Teslarati . \u201cIt could go down 95% \u2013 and maybe it should go down 95%.\u201d He clarified that it\u2019s hard to predict an exact timeline \u2014 \u201cIt could happen in a month, six months, a year, three years, or five years,\u201d he said. But in his eyes, a drop is coming. And when it hits, it could be steep. Live Events What\u2019s driving fears of a Tesla stock crash? Tesla has moved beyond just being an electric carmaker. The company now deals in robotics and AI, which are both major growth areas. But Gardell emphasized that, at its core, Tesla is still an automaker \u2014 and compared to its peers, its stock is way out of proportion. According to Companies Market Cap , Tesla\u2019s valuation is more than triple that of major auto giants like Toyota and Volkswagen. Yet, Tesla\u2019s recent sales trends are not keeping up. Sales have dipped in key markets, and the controversial public presence of Elon Musk hasn\u2019t helped. As political tensions around Musk grow \u2014 especially in the U.S. \u2014 some analysts worry that Tesla\u2019s reputation could be taking a long-term hit. That\u2019s not just bad PR; it could mean real consequences for investor confidence. On top of that, Tesla\u2019s highly anticipated Cybertruck is underperforming. While Musk once projected annual sales of 500,000 units, current figures suggest it\u2019s not even hitting 10% of that. To move the product, Tesla has been forced to adjust financing options and offer more attractive interest rates to buyers. Could a Tesla crash ripple through the EV market? Despite Tesla's struggles, the broader EV market continues to thrive. In fact, Q4 2024 saw a new record for EV sales in the U.S., according to Cox Automotive . People are still switching to electric vehicles in large numbers, attracted by long-term savings and environmental benefits. But here\u2019s the concern: If Tesla's valuation tanks, will it scare investors away from other EV companies too? It's a real risk. Gardell's worry is that an overvalued company like Tesla might damage broader investor trust in green tech if it falls too hard and too fast. Still, it's not all bad news for EV buyers. As Tesla trims prices and tweaks financing to maintain demand, competitors may follow suit. That could lead to better deals for consumers, not just from Tesla but across the EV landscape. Should investors start looking beyond U.S. tech stocks? Gardell believes the stock market imbalance between the U.S. and Europe is reaching historic levels. \u201cThe difference between American stocks and European stocks has never been greater,\u201d he told EFN. For cautious investors, this may be a moment to reconsider their strategy. European equities, in his view, are offering more realistic valuations. And with companies in Europe also expanding into the EV and clean energy space, there may be opportunities to invest in future-forward industries without the same bubble risk. FAQs: Why did Christer Gardell warn about a Tesla stock crash ? He said Tesla\u2019s value is too high and could drop by 95%. How could Tesla\u2019s stock affect the electric vehicle market? A crash could shake investor trust in EV companies.

In his spare time, James is a long-suffering Rochdale fan and loves reading, running and music. Contact him via [email protected] X @ JimmyMoorhouse Advert Advert Advert Love him or hate him, Elon Musk has been part of some pretty wild projects over the years. Having one of his own cars up in space is perhaps one of the most random. While the Space X founder has lost plenty on Tesla stock in recent months, with Donald Trump 's tariffs only leaving more holes in his pocket , he remains the world's richest man and probably doesn't blink twice when a couple of million evaporates from his bank account. The businessman has taken on more of a political role since Trump's return to the Oval Office. This has hardly done much for the 53-year-old's controversial image, and it seems as though the South African's best work has been beyond Earth's orbit, given the success of various space projects over the years. Running a space company and a car business simultaneously, if you've got a mind like Musk, it's likely you'd put two and two together and send a Tesla up to the stars - and that's exactly what he did in 2018. Advert The Tesla Roadster was ejected into space as a dummy payload for a Falcon Heavy test flight. It's fitted with a mannequin in a space suit called Starman - a tongue-in-cheek nod to the David Bowie classic. The Bowie song Space Oddity was also set up to play on repeat through the vehicle's sound system. The SpaceX team also chucked a Hot Wheels car and a copy of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy inside for good measure. Elon Musk (Graeme Sloan for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Musk previously revealed exactly why he sent the Tesla Roadster skyward, saying that he hoped that humanity would end up living on other planets and that his 'descendants will be able to drag it [the car] back to a museum'. The chances of that may seem pretty low, but the more kids Musk has, the more those chances improve. Musk has also said that he wanted to put the 'silliest' thing he and his SpaceX team could think of out of Earth's orbit, and apparently they settled on a car. Gosh, Elon, your imagination knows no bounds! Anyway, after seven years in space travelling at speeds well above 10,000 mph, you might think that it's tricky to keep track of the Roadster, but fortunately, like nearly everything these days, there's a website for that. Advert The \u2018Where is Roadster?\u2019 site keeps track of the Tesla as it zooms through space. At the time of writing, it is currently 228,647,460 miles from Earth. However, it's travelling back towards its home planet at the lightning-fast speed of 16,106 mph. A real space oddity... (SpaceX via Getty Images) That means that its speed has increased by 5,000 mph in the last week alone. Maybe it's homesick and wants to get back in time for Christmas, learning an important lesson from the NASA astronauts who end up spending far too long away from Earth. So what happens when the space car does finally come back home? Well, Musk could land himself in real trouble if the Tesla does crash land back to Earth. As long as it steers clear of any humans or man-made objects and doesn't cause any damage, it seems as if the billionaire will get away with it. Hopefully it avoids the likes of Mount Kilimanjaro and Niagara Falls, too.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they\u2019re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,\u201d Lutnick told ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. Recommended Videos The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer devices that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. The move was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an expected tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broadly. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. The electronics exemption is the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House \u201cis dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.\u201d In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies \u2014 including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \u2014 who are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broadly. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. The electronics exemption is the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note.

But in many ways, the deal made sense. xAI\u2019s chatbot, Grok, was already deeply integrated with X, X was floundering financially , and Musk needed a way to make his $44 billion Twitter acquisition look less like an impulsive takeover and more like a strategic play for AGI dominance. It also pointed to something deeper about how Musk\u2019s empire works: investing in any one of his companies isn\u2019t about a quick return on investment. It\u2019s about buying into the mysticism around Musk and swallowing whole a narrative of success that outpaces the actual numbers. Some call it a grift , pointing to Musk\u2019s history of overpromising and underdelivering . But the market is increasingly more tolerant \u2013 welcoming, even \u2013 of narrative-led investments, particularly when the thread that ties the tale together is one of the president\u2019s right-hand men. \u201cAll of Elon\u2019s companies today are basically one company,\u201d Yoni Rechtman, a principal at Slow Ventures, told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s all already Elon, Inc. There are people who work across multiple companies simultaneously. They share a web of capital connections. They do business with one another, and he treats them all effectively as one company. So [the xAI-X merger] just ends some of the fiction that the two businesses were separate.\u201d The thinking among Musk bulls like Ron Baron, the founder of investment management firm Baron Capital, is that \u201cevery single thing [Musk] does is helping everything else he does,\u201d as Baron phrased it . Other businesses under Musk\u2019s control include Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink \u2013 some of which reportedly share resources . \u201cWhen [Musk] bought Twitter, did he have in his mind that there\u2019s an opportunity to have this data, a tremendous value for licensing? When he decided he wanted to go to Mars with SpaceX, did he really think initially that there\u2019s a real opportunity here for the internet around the world, and there\u2019s gonna be hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue opportunity? When he started off with EVs for Tesla, did he really think that this is gonna merge into self-driving, where you can make hundreds of billions of dollars a year of extra profits, and Grok [\u2026] and you\u2019re gonna have connected cars all around the world? [\u2026] All these businesses link up. It\u2019s the ecosystem. It\u2019s the Elon ecosystem, and I think it\u2019s really interesting when you look at it that way.\u201d Baron Capital has invested across Musk\u2019s ecosystem, an example of the investor crossover between the billionaire\u2019s various companies. Firms like 8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, DFJ Growth, Fidelity Investments, Manhattan Venture Partners, Saudi Arabia\u2019s PIF, Sequoia Capital, Vy Capital, and others also hold positions throughout Musk\u2019s corporate web. That brings us back to the xAI-X deal. Pundits questioned how the acquisition could value X at $33 billion, more than triple its valuation just a few months ago, and how it could value xAI at $80 billion considering the AI company reportedly has little in the way of revenue. But valuations aren\u2019t always based on what exists today. Rather, they take into account what investors are hoping for \u2013 and that\u2019s particularly true when it comes to Musk\u2019s ventures. Just look at Tesla. The electric vehicle maker has been treated like a tech stock for years despite the fact that it has automaker margins , based largely on the belief that Tesla will one day unlock groundbreaking autonomy in the form of self-driving cars and humanoid robots. \u201cThe reason why [Tesla\u2019s] stock trades at 80 times earnings and the comp group trades at 25 times earnings is that people are making a bet on the long term, and it\u2019s not about what happens to numbers this year,\u201d Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told TechCrunch. \u201cThat\u2019s one of Elon\u2019s superpowers, this ability to keep investors engaged for the long term.\u201d Munster\u2019s firm has invested in X, xAI, and Tesla. It\u2019s exactly the type of all-in Musk backer that stands to benefit the most from a deal like xAI buying X, assuming Musk can indeed deliver on his pledge of marrying X\u2019s real-time data trove and distribution platform with xAI\u2019s infrastructure and AI expertise. Of course, consolidated value also comes with increased risk. Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School whose research lies at the intersection of business and society, told TechCrunch that the biggest immediate risk factor for investors is the ongoing lawsuit that X is facing from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The suit accuses Musk of misleading investors by delaying the disclosure of his previous investments in Twitter. The SEC has argued that this allowed Musk to buy more Twitter shares at artificially low prices. Wang listed a few other risk considerations, such as anticompetition and user privacy concerns, particularly regarding how X quietly opted all users into data collection for AI model training. The opt-in change has already raised the ire of one regulator, Ireland\u2019s DPC , which recently began investigating it as a potential breach of Europe\u2019s GDPR law. \u201cAnother kind of risk here is that there isn\u2019t a consensus framework for how the AI market is going to be regulated, but you\u2019re already seeing traces of this in Europe and, up until recently, in California,\u201d Wang said. \u201cA lot of these frameworks have to do with how AI models are deployed in terms of distributing information [\u2026] They ascribe responsibility to the companies that are creating AI models, as well as providing access to those models.\u201d Musk might also simply lose interest in a project, Rechtman said. \u201cI think that is what a lot of Tesla shareholders are feeling right now,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere for the last several months, Elon\u2019s number one company has been the Trump campaign, and his other projects have languished.\u201d When asked about some of these risk factors, Munster appeared nonplussed. He suggested they\u2019re inconsequential given the enormity of, for example, xAI\u2019s value proposition and potential to become a dominant player in AI. \u201cWe\u2019re betting the firm on the belief that AI is going to be more transformative than what people think,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the value [\u2026] of one of the four brains that the world is going to run on?\u201d Rechtman said that Musk bulls aren\u2019t blindly loyal, per se, but simply trust in Musk\u2019s superpower to \u201cbend capital markets to his will\u201d in a way that allows him to do things and build businesses that nobody else can. \u201cThe people who are in these businesses have just gone long Elon, and they will continue to go long Elon,\u201d Rechtman said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising to me that they will just continue to tell you that the emperor is wearing clothes.\u201d Not for nothing, buying into Musk\u2019s more speculative bets, like X, is one way to potentially unlock more investment opportunities in the Muskverse, Rechtman said. \u201cSpaceX is a real thing, and it will never go public,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the only way to invest in SpaceX is to get access to the tenders. And the only way to get access to the tenders is to be in Elon\u2019s good graces.\u201d Topics AI , Elon Musk , Grok , Social , X , xAI Rebecca Bellan Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch, where she covers Tesla and Elon Musk\u2019s broader empire, autonomy, AI, electrification, gig work platforms, Big Tech regulatory scrutiny, and more.
