Sign up for the Surge , the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday. Welcome to this week\u2019s edition of the Surge, a newsletter about all things politics in the United States, a place that can now be considered an emerging market country. Hey, here\u2019s some news: Your money is gone, forever. It\u2019s called the \u201cArt of the Deal.\u201d At least we\u2019ve still got Medicaid for bare-bones health ca\u2014oops, maybe not? What a week for the American pocketbook. Democrats\u2019 crippling addiction to nuance, meanwhile, is preventing some of them from saying the very easy sentence \u201cTrump killed the economy.\u201d And for ulcer-related reasons, we\u2019re not even touching the court cases involving the Trump administration\u2019s arbitrary kidnappings\u2014read the Slate legal people for that. Much is going on. Can anyone\u2014or any \u2026 thing\u2014stop it? 1. The bond market If there\u2019s anything that can get through to Trump \u2026 Last week, Donald Trump set in place a tariff plan that, if carried through, would at least cause a recession and at most put an end to our American-led economic and international order. He then played golf four days in a row. (Respect.) He and his team didn\u2019t necessarily mind the stock market going down 10 or 15 percent\u2014supposedly that would be the temporary pain. The more worrisome sign came when the bond market began to careen off the edge. One particular red alert was how the yield on 10-year Treasurys was shooting directly up, when typically, they should be a safe haven for investors in bear markets. That\u2019s one of those existential signs that the rest of the world is thinking about moving on from you. Trump\u2019s advisers publicly denied that the bond market had anything to do with the Wednesday decision to issue a 90-day \u201cpause\u201d on reciprocal tariffs. Privately, though, they said that was exactly the reason for the climb-down, and Trump himself conceded that markets were getting a little too \u201cyippy\u201d for his taste. Unfortunately, we\u2019re afraid Trump needs to take another look at the bond market. Despite a one-day stock market rally after Trump\u2019s \u201cpause\u201d\u2014which still left tariffs at their highest levels in 100 years\u2014everything resumed crashing by Thursday, with stocks and the dollar down and Treasury yields skyrocketing back up. This is the financial equivalent of someone (in this case, all other countries) breaking up with you via text. We know what we did. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement 2. Scott Bessent This goes well beyond positive reinforcement. We\u2019re still shocked by the spin that Bessent and these other dorks have been issuing since the \u201cpause\u201d to claim that everything is going according to plan. What really happened here is that Trump, who thinks that tariffs are a direct tax that the U.S. puts on other countries, did something impossibly reckless, because he could, and then had to begin walking it back. But his deputies have been tasked with conveying these actions as if he had just played the world. \u201cNo one creates leverage for himself like POTUS,\u201d Bessent posted. Commerce Secretary Howard \u201cGood Times\u201d Lutnick, sharing a screenshot of Trump\u2019s Truth Social post announcing the pause, wrote about how he and Bessent sat beside Trump as he drafted \u201cone of the most extraordinary Truth posts of his Presidency.\u201d White House policy chief Stephen Miller wrote that \u201cyou have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history.\u201d The only thing more head-spinning than some of these lines is that there\u2019s an audience that will believe it. 3. Mike Johnson Never a doubt. It was the House\u2019s turn this week to pass the compromise budget blueprint that the Senate passed last week, providing the skeletal structure for\u2014and finally allowing them to start real work on\u2014Trump\u2019s \u201cone big, beautiful bill.\u201d To recap, the \u201ccompromise\u201d that GOP leaders of both chambers struck was that they will make the difficult decisions later: The House would write a bill with bigger spending cuts, the Senate would write a bill with fewer, and they\u2019d come to some icky agreement irritating everyone in the end. (This could take several more months.) House conservatives, though, didn\u2019t like this. They wanted to straitjacket the Senate into big spending cuts now. And so we had another situation this week in which 10 or 20 House conservatives said they would never, ever, ever vote for this blueprint. The ins and outs weren\u2019t really worth paying attention to, because the holdouts\u2019 posture presented three options: First, they could\u2019ve voted to kill the blueprint, and with it, Trump\u2019s agenda (they didn\u2019t). Second, they could\u2019ve tried to negotiate again with the Senate on the blueprint, reopening talks on this never-ending first step just before both chambers went into a two-week recess (they would never). Third, the House conservatives could claim they got some \u201cassurances\u201d\u2014say, the speaker putting his job on the line \u2014about how spending cuts would definitely come later, vote to move the process along, and avoid Trump\u2019s wrath. That last option was always the only plausible one. The House passed the blueprint Thursday morning. Now it\u2019s time for them to write the bill. Plus vulnerable House Republicans have locked themselves into voting for a bill with hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts! Wishing everyone a good time.

That\u2019s partially because of how in the previous week, he made a Wisconsin judicial election a referendum on himself and biffed it. The day after that election, though, was \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d and the silence of Musk\u2014the richest businessman in history, whose companies do a lot of international commerce\u2014was revealing. It also didn\u2019t last. Before long, Musk was sniping on social media at Peter Navarro, Trump\u2019s top trade adviser and the devil on Trump\u2019s shoulder urging on aggressive tariffs. He posted early last Saturday that Navarro\u2019s Ph.D. from Harvard was \u201ca bad thing, not a good thing,\u201d and that Navarro \u201cain\u2019t built shit.\u201d Navarro responded in an interview a couple of days later that Musk was merely a \u201ccar assembler,\u201d not a manufacturer, who imported Tesla parts from around the world. That really set Musk off. He called Navarro a \u201cmoron\u201d and \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks.\u201d In the latter post, he tagged the account \u201c@IfindRetards,\u201d and ultimately, he referred to Navarro as \u201cPeter Retarrdo.\u201d All very interesting stuff. It\u2019s worth emphasizing that these are two of the closest advisers to the president of the United States. Advertisement 5. Ken Paxton A big, expensive, stupid primary. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a MAGA showman who led a lawsuit to overturn the 2020 election and had also been impeached, though not convicted, by the state Legislature after nearly a decade of criminal investigations, announced a long-awaited primary challenge to Sen. John Cornyn this week. The dynamic is simple enough to understand: Paxton sees an opening to outflank Cornyn on craziness, as Cornyn is a normal human being who occasionally works to pass bipartisan legislation or expresses disapproval of some of Trump\u2019s actions. The two don\u2019t hide their despair of each other. Cornyn this week described Paxton as \u201ca con man and a fraud,\u201d and added that \u201cI am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him.\u201d The only thing motivating Paxton, Cornyn said, is \u201cvanity and personal ambition.\u201d This primary is going to be expensive and nasty at every turn. Regrettably, it\u2019s also going to force Cornyn, the sort of GOP senator you\u2019d like to have as even a modest check on Trump here or there, to behave like a caveman for the next year. Exhibit A: In March, Cornyn posted a photo of himself pretending to read The Art of the Deal in the kitchen with the caption \u201cRecommended.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement 6. Gretchen Whitmer A big, expensive, stupid primary. The adorable Democrats who still think there\u2019s going to be a presidential election in 2028 for them to run in were circling each other this week as they responded to Trump\u2019s tariffs. The skirmish began on Wednesday, when Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer offered a nuanced criticism of the trade war. She said she understood \u201cthe motivation behind the tariffs,\u201d but that \u201cyou can\u2019t just pull out the tariff hammer and swing at every problem without a clear, defined end goal.\u201d When asked how she would have enacted them differently, though, she said \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about that.\u201d Now, sure: The politics of trade are sensitive in a state like Michigan. But since she is a prospective 2028 candidate, potential Democratic primary opponents took the opportunity to differentiate themselves. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2014who also represents a state hit hard by free trade agreements\u2014 gave a much more blunt critique of the tariffs, accusing Trump of \u201cthreatening economic calamity,\u201d \u201cupending world markets,\u201d \u201charming seniors\u201d and \u201cisolating America in the world.\u201d Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker called the tariffs \u201cTrump\u2019s Tax on Working Families.\u201d And Colorado Gov. Jared Polis responded directly to Whitmer, posting that \u201cthe \u2018tariff hammer\u2019 winds up hitting your own hand rather than the nail.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the only punishment Whitmer endured this week, though. She also met Trump in D.C. and was roped into an Oval Office press conference where Trump said she\u2019d \u201creally done an excellent job.\u201d Then Trump proceeded to sign a few authoritarian executive orders, forcing Whitmer to issue a clarifying statement saying that she had no idea that was going to happen. About those executive orders \u2026 Advertisement 7. Chris Krebs Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The executive orders are not getting more sane!

Except, Maybe, for the Most Unlikely One of All. This Content is Available for Slate Plus members only Trump\u2019s Tariff Chaos Could Give Him a Surprising Problem at the Supreme Court We\u2019re going to start with a very low bar here. At least President Trump\u2019s most egregious, strongman-like executive orders seeking retribution have been targeting institutions. You know, universities, Big Law, what have you. Not anymore! Now he\u2019s now going directly after individuals. On Wednesday, he released two executive orders \u201caddressing risks\u201d against Trump 1\u2013era officials who disobeyed him. The first is against Chris Krebs, the former head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, whom Trump fired following the 2020 election for assuring the public that it was conducted securely. \u201cKrebs, through CISA, falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen,\u201d this actual memorandum from the president reads. The order doesn\u2019t just strip Krebs of any security clearances (child\u2019s play). It calls on the attorney general and homeland security secretaries to investigate him and report their findings to the president. A similar order was issued against Miles Taylor, the former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff who wrote a much-discussed anonymous column for the New York Times in 2018 titled \u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.\u201d On the law-firm front, even those decrees are getting more baseless\u2014and why not? It\u2019s working! \u2014as Trump issued new sanctions on the firm that represented Dominion Voting Systems in its successful legal action against the muppets who defamed them. He also signed another order \u201cMaintaining Acceptable Water Pressure in Showerheads,\u201d which is probably a lot better. Or it\u2019s bad. We don\u2019t know\u2014he signed a lot of executive orders this week to distract from how he had collapsed the economy. Get the best of news and politics Sign up for Slate\u2019s evening newsletter.
