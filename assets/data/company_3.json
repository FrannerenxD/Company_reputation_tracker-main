Reuters reports that the company, which makes phone cases, power banks, adapters, cables, and more, raised prices on a fifth of its products since Thursday. The move comes as the company passes the cost of US tariffs onto its US-based customers. Some 127 Anker products have seen an average increase of 18% since Thursday last week, with the majority of those occurring after Monday, April 7, when U.S. President Donald Trump added an extra 50% import duty on Chinese goods, according to data from e-commerce services provider SmartScout. Reuters notes that, on an investor call earlier in the week, Anker had said that it was able to raise prices \u201cas it had bargaining power and because its rivals were mainly Chinese and under similar tariff pressure, but did not provide specifics.\u201d Ultimately, more companies could well choose to follow suit. Tariffs make it more costly for companies to bring goods from specific countries into the United States. One way that those companies can negate the additional costs while protecting their profits is to increase prices, effectively passing the cost of the tariffs onto customers. The result is that US-based customers pay more for products as a result of the tariffs that were imposed by its leaders.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16. Review the configuration of all devices.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

Discover SCENE Jianwei Xun, the supposed Hong Kong philosopher whose book \"Hypnocracy\" claims Elon Musk and President Donald Trump use utopian promises and empty language, never really existed, at least not physically. Instead, the acclaimed author was a \"collaborative\" creation between Andrea Colamedici, an Italian publisher, and two AI tools \u2013 Claude from Anthropic and ChatGPT from OpenAI. \"I wanted to write a book that would help people better understand the new ways power manifests itself,\" Colamedici told Decrypt . But it wasn't until after an investigative report from L'Espresso that Xun's website was updated to acknowledge the experiment, snapshots from Wayback Machine reviewed by Decrypt show. Still, the book received critical acclaim. L\u2019Espresso reports that L\u2019Opinion , a French daily, had detailed how President Emmanuel Macron had \u201cappreciated\u201d Xun\u2019s writings. Earlier in February, a roundtable at the World AI Cannes Festival extensively discussed Xun\u2019s ideas. \u00c9ditions Gallimard, a leading French publisher, has committed to a new translation from the Italian original, after the first edition in French from Philosophie Magazine. A Spanish translation from Editorial Rosamer\u00f3n is slated for release on April 20. Vibe philosophy? Xun was \"an exercise in ontological engineering,\" Colamedici explained in a post-revelation interview with Le Grand Continent . While this experiment with AI looked novel, critics point out the book could be in trouble. The European Union's AI Act , approved in March 2024, considers failure to label AI-generated content a serious violation \u2013 a requirement critics claim Colamedici's experiment disregarded. In previous versions of its bio, Xun was described as a \"Hong Kong-born cultural analyst and philosopher\" who studied at \u201cDublin University.\u201d That wasn\u2019t true. According to an anonymous source from the University College of Dublin's philosophy department, no person named \"Jianwei Xun\" exists in their database or those of other Dublin-based universities. \"The fact that the author had inverted the Chinese order 'surname-name' was an immediate red flag,\" Laura Ruggieri, a Hong Kong-based researcher, told Decrypt , explaining how she spotted inconsistencies as early as February. Ruggieri previously taught semiotics\u2014the study of symbols and signs\u2014at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. She asked her colleagues about Xun. Nobody knew who that was. \u201cNot a single one of them has ever met Xun or heard his name,\u201d Ruggieri said. \u201cIf Colamedici had used his real name and admitted that AI had written the book, no one would have bought it.\u201d Responding to those allegations to Decrypt , Colamedici claimed these were deliberate clues \"left for those willing to question and investigate,\u201d claiming the revelation was \"predetermined.\" \u201cWe actually did everything possible to make Xun\u2019s non-existence evident to anyone with even minimally inquisitive eyes,\u201d Colamedici said. Colamedici insists that AI did not write the book. Instead, Claude and ChatGPT \"served as interlocutors.\" In the words of Xun The book describes itself as a \"journey into the fractured mirror of modern reality,\" and discusses how Musk and Trump have constructed an alternate reality through obsessive repetition. It was written \"for those who suspect that the world they see is only a shadow of something far more complex,\" its Amazon blurb claims. Xun's thoughts center on \"hypnocracy,\" describing a regime that exerts control through \"algorithmic modulation\" of collective consciousness instead of censorship. In English: fake news. Xun claims that Trump's speeches and social media posts create conditions of uncertainty. Trump \"empties language: his words, repeated endlessly, become empty signifiers, devoid of meaning yet charged with hypnotic power,\" Xun wrote. Xun claims Musk makes promises \u201cdestined not to materialize,\u201d by \u201cflooding our imagination\u201d with ventures such as space colonization and neural interfaces. \"Together they modulate desires, rewrite expectations, colonize the unconscious,\" the AI philosopher wrote. Spokepeople for Musk and Trump did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.

A flexible drain snake that'll get out all those clumps of hair and gunk so the bathtub stops filling up past your ankles every time you shower. Just stick it down the drain, twist it, and the ridges at the end will catch all the goop, making sure it all comes out. Amazon, www.amazon.com This pack contains a reusable handle and five single-use heads that you just remove and dispose of after handling your clogged pipes. Promising review: \"Wow. Best thing ever. Seriously. I have had tweezers and sticks and plumbers and chemicals trying to get my master sink to drain. Plumber even said I need an entirely new faucet to get the drain plug part because they don't sell those separately. Well, I have two sinks, a tub, and shower that all match so that was not a valid solution. Doubt I can find the same model. So I bought this thing, stuffed it down, and pulled up hair and black muck. Did it about eight times quickly, ran the water, went right down the drain. Seriously. This is the best tool ever and the best $20 I have ever spent. Everyone with a sink needs this tool. Seriously.\" \u2014 juliejules Get a five-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in other sets and styles). 2.

I am currently waiting for a new Invisalign set. My old Invisalign needed to be cleaned. I read the reviews and decided to purchase. OMG, it worked! They had a fresh taste and were clean. I wish I had found this product sooner. I did let them soak overnight only because I had been wearing them for the last four months. Nothing happened to Invisalign; there was no weakness or anything. Just very clean and fresh. If I could have given the product 10 stars, I would have. \" \u2014 Lisa R. Get 120 tablets from Amazon for $18.81 (available in five pack sizes). 3.

Promising review: \"I never usually write reviews but this is an exception. I've had my AirPods for over a year and when the sound quality was diminishing, I was afraid they had a short life expectancy and I would need to get a new pair! Even after using cotton buds to clean the AirPods out, I thought that was enough until my friend said there's stuff built up and hard to see, but there was nothing able to get it out! Enter this product. It literally took five minutes to clean each ear bud effectively and instantly the sound quality was as good as new! Loud, clear, less trouble connecting to my phone, etc. You don't need a full square to clean them, so you can pull a piece off or reuse a square with a side you haven't used!

This has dual-layered bristles: regular ones and ultra-long, thin flossing bristles that get *deep* in between your teeth and gums. Reviewers are saying it feels like they got their teeth cleaned at the dentist, but nope! \u2014 just this very innovative toothbrush. Emma Lord / BuzzFeed Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, specializing in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed for deeper cleans. Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord has to say: \"I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.\" Promising review: \"I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth \u2014 it definitely gets between the teeth and also, more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck, and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!\" \u2014 Jason A. Get a pair from Amazon for $9.99 . 7.

Promising review: \"Perfect! Exactly what I needed to organize my mop, broom, scoop, etc. Efficient and easy to use. A little hard to get my scoop into it, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s thicker than the rest of the items. Love that there are hooks.

I absolutely hate taking the shower curtains off because of the whole open and close for several shower curtains. I know you\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s just shower curtain hooks.\u2019 And it is. But when you have to change out the creepy shower liner that likes to attack you, and you dread doing so, this just adds seconds to your life. No more unsnapping. Simply take out the liner, place the liner on the appropriate hook, and presto.\" \u2014 Nardsbaby Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in 18 colors). 10.

I have tried muscle relaxers, stretching, and many other things, but a couple of muscles in my upper back would just knot up with any stress, physical or emotional, and the pain was nearly constant. I used this for about a half hour on all of my muscles with the first use, and the effects were immediate and profound. Pain relief was instant , and occasional use for a couple of minutes to the affected areas has been able to maintain that relief. I loved it so much that I bought one for my brother, who says it is helping him tremendously, as well. I have charged my massager twice in the last two months, battery life is excellent!\" \u2014 Patty S. Get it from Amazon for $89.99 (available in seven colors). 11.

Pan is dropped, and greasy meat juice is all over our patio brick. In freezing temps. I use a putty knife to get some out, but there the stain remains six months later. Even muriatic acid didn\u2019t cut it. Ordered this. Tried a spot. Let it dry overnight. Swept it. Stain is almost gone. I apply it to the rest of the stain and let it set. But this time it rains and turns it gooey. Fortunately, new power washer and I join forces with Chomp, and within a half hour, it\u2019s totally gone. Amazing product. 1,000% satisfied. \" \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (available in two sizes). 17.

A dishwasher magnet so everyone in the house knows NOT to put their dirty spoon in with the freshly cleaned silverware. Sometimes it's too hard to tell whether the dishwasher needs to be run or unloaded, and this just clears up all the confusion. Sally Elshorafa / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"What took them so long?? Every household should have one of these. Does your partner point to the dishwasher and ask you, 'Hey, are these good?' Mine did, almost daily. Not anymore, though! A breeze to install (our dishwasher is magnetic, but I'm really glad it came with adhesive pads \u2014 someday when we move, if we need them we have them!), and even though I bought it (mostly) as a joke, I use the heck out of it. Slides easily when it needs to.\" \u2014 Andrea Braun Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in six styles). 19. A bestselling ChomChom pet hair remover if you want to see what your clothes, furniture, and other fabric surfaces look like *not* covered in fur. It's reusable and works its magic without using anything sticky (so no residue)! This gadget went super viral based on its results \u2014 and that's when you know a product is good. Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed See the ChomChom roller in action on TikTok ! BuzzFeed Shopping editor Jenae Sitzes swears by this: \"The tens of thousands of 5-star Amazon reviews are reason enough to add the ChomChom to your cart immediately \u2014 but let me add my own personal review to the stack. I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, and I took the photos above to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller \u2014 at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair. It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside , which does require you to apply a bit of pressure. Afterward, you'll just dump out the hair that's been trapped inside. The ChomChom is best for large flat surfaces like couches and beds.\" Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in three colors). 20. And a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator \u2014 I know you're busy, but you simply cannot sit any longer in a house that smells like cat urine.

That one spot behind the couch that your cat won't stop peeing on doesn't stand a chance. \ud83d\udcaa www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This product is amazing!!!! We have a Rottweiler pup and a bichon pup, and our house was feeling the PAIN! I tried everything and used to tell my wife, 'With all the science and technology in the world, we still can\u2019t come up with something that gets rid of the dog mark smell!' This product does everything and more. Just ordered another round. We were about to throw away some furniture due to the smell and now after use we can keep it. Saved me hundreds. Well worth the money. \" \u2014 clayton s tonkin Get it from Amazon for $17.96 (available in two sizes and packs of two or three). 21. A standing weeder that uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. It has a bamboo handle and four steel claws to really dig into those roots and pull them OUT. Your back deserves a break from playing tug of war with stubborn weeds. Amazon Grampa's Gardenware Co. is an Oregon-based, family-owned small business. Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 22. Some foaming garbage disposal cleaning packets to clean out all the gunk from your roommates who just don't understand the concept of throwing food in the garbage instead of down the sink. Just insert a packet into the disposal with hot water trickling to the side, then turn on the disposal and watch it fizz up \u2014 soon, those gag-worthy smells will be a thing of the past. Amazon Promising review: \"Saw on TikTok (don\u2019t judge) and automatically added to cart. So easy to use, takes probably a minute to fully bubble up and clean, and you\u2019re left with a clean sink! I use with other drain cleaning products, but would 100% recommend for weekly maintenance.\" \u2014 Jessica Hamilton Get a four-pack from Amazon for $7.90 (available in a pack of two). 23. And while you're at it, some dishwasher tablets that break down lime and mineral buildup to properly clean your dishwasher (you know, the machine that cleans your dishes ) without *any* effort on your part. Just pop in a tablet and run the dishwasher as normal \u2014 it sure beats having to climb in there yourself and scrub. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and dishes just not getting clean. Then, I became aware that the water softener was no longer doing its job so I had the rental company replace it. Dishwasher performance improved somewhat. I decided to do two more loads before deciding to purchase a new one. Then I saw a product test review for Affresh. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway so I added that to my order. When it came, I tossed one of the tablets into the bottom of the full machine per the instructions and ran the regular cycle. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I will use this faithfully every month, as recommended. \" \u2014 Sheila Get a pack of six tablets from Amazon for $7.49 . 24.

Been using them since high school! The amount of junk and buildup that comes off is so satisfying to see! It can be irritating when removing, especially if you have sensitive skin. Don\u2019t put any moisturizers or oils on afterward; otherwise, you\u2019ll get a pimple or two! \ud83d\ude2c\" \u2014 Christina S.

I prefer to apply my makeup with brushes and when they would get caked with product I would throw them away and buy new. Well that got expensive-quickly. I tried this product on a whim\u2026and boy am I glad!! I wash, rinse and dry in the morning and they are dry and ready for use by lunch if I need a touch up. It does take a few minutes but SO WORTH it!! They more I use it, the faster I am getting. My brushes look new after and feel so much better on my skin. My makeup even goes on nicer.

Plus, keeping your stacks of clothes organized and separate makes it easier to find what you need faster! Say goodbye to digging through messy piles. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Love these acrylic shelf dividers! They make my closet look so neat and organized. I used them to divide shelves that hold my folded workout tops. I used a folding helper tool like the ones retail stores use, which gives my folded clothes a uniform width/look, and by using two dividers on each shelf, I can fit three stacks perfectly on my 30-inch wide shelves. I am ordering more to add to my shelves with sweaters! \" \u2014 Aimee Lonergan Get them from Amazon for $22.99+ (available in two sizes and in various pack sizes). 28.

There are also ties on the inside to keep your duvet in place. I absolutely LOVE everything about this cover. Can\u2019t wait to get home in my bed after a long, exhausting work shift on my feet.

Just attach the clips to both straps in the back, and voila! \u2014 no one can see your bra straps from the front. Amazon Promising review: \"My bra straps spent more time off my shoulders than on them. I have bras that fit perfectly, but the straps are too wide-set or something. I'm so glad I bought these little bra strap clip holders because they've solved the problem. I've used them for three days now, and my straps have not fallen off of my shoulders even once in that time. Amazing! I love them! I put a clip holder on my bra and then put the bra on like a T-shirt \u2014 over my head, put my arms in, then fasten it as usual in the back \u2014 pretty easy. The length of the clip holders are adjustable. I have fully extended them to fit across the back of my 38DD bras.

All the grime, rolled up skin, flakes and chucks \u2014 shudder, that was on me???

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

EPCOT The HOKA Bondi 8s are undeniably comfy \u2014 we\u2019re talking marshmallow soles, maximum cushion, all the foot-hugging support you could want. But the truth is that we don\u2019t always wear them in Disney World\u2026 and yeah, we\u2019ve got our reasons. DISCLOSURE: This post may contain affiliate links, which means when you click a link and make a purchase, we receive a commission. First, let\u2019s give credit where it\u2019s due: HOKA Bondi 8s are built for comfort. If you\u2019ve ever worn them, you know that soft landing and pillowy feel underfoot. \u00a9Amazon It\u2019s like walking on memory foam. They\u2019ve got great arch support, a wider base for stability, and that oversized midsole is a lifesaver on long walking days. We totally get why so many people swear by them. In fact, most of our AllEars team lives in their HOKAs when they\u2019re in the parks. Grab them here But here\u2019s the painfully honest truth: they\u2019re chunky. Like, really chunky. And while that\u2019s part of the design (and part of what makes them so comfortable), we can\u2019t help but feel a little\u2026 clunky in them. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker, but when you\u2019re already sweating through your tank top and trying to get a cute castle photo? Yeah, it matters. \u00a9Amazon We own the Bondi 8s and do wear them \u2014 just not all the time. Especially not when we\u2019re trying to put together a cuter park look. We know, we know, style shouldn\u2019t come before comfort when it comes to Disney shoes, but sometimes we reach for other shoes instead. They\u2019re sleeker, they pair better with our outfits, and even if they don\u2019t treat our feet quite as nicely by hour eight\u2026 we do it anyway. We suffer a little for the \u2018fit. And we\u2019re not proud of it, but we\u2019re being honest here. So let\u2019s weigh the pros and cons: HOKA Bondi 8 Pros: Extreme comfort and support \u2014 seriously, A+ Great for people who need extra cushioning or have foot pain Durable and reliable even after long days in the parks Fit for actual running (or chasing Lightning Lanes) HOKA Bondi 8 Cons: Bulky, heavy look that doesn\u2019t always go with every outfit Can feel a little stiff at first and take up a lot of space in your suitcase Expensive \u2014 if you\u2019re only wearing them for Disney, they\u2019re an investment Let\u2019s talk about the alternative sneakers we\u2019re reaching for: First, we\u2019ve got these New Balance Men\u2019s/Women\u2019s Oxford Sneakers : \u00a9Amazon They\u2019re still cushy but way more streamlined. Plus, they have a fun retro vibe that works with most of my park outfits. Grab them here Next up, we\u2019ve got these Brooks Women\u2019s Adrenaline GTS 23 Supportive Running Shoes : \u00a9Amazon These are solid running shoes with real support. They\u2019re not quite as chunky as the HOKAS but still have that plush, reliable feel. If you want all-day comfort in a slightly more streamlined silhouette, this is a great option. Grab them here Lastly, we\u2019ve got these adidas Women\u2019s Cloudfoam Pure Sportswear Sneakers : \u00a9Amazon If your Disney style leans sporty-chic, these are a great pick. The foam is soft, the fit is flexible, and the design is cute enough to blend with pretty much any park outfit. Grab them here At the end of the day, wear what works for you. If you\u2019re prioritizing function over fashion, HOKAs are probably your best bet. And if you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019s fully committed to comfort (you should be!), don\u2019t let the look stop you. \u00a9Amazon But if you\u2019re like us \u2014 balancing comfort with aesthetics, especially when you\u2019ve planned a whole Disney look \u2014 we totally get reaching for a sleeker sneaker even if you know your feet will hate you by dinnertime. And yes, we know this is a hot take. But someone had to say it. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for the best Disney essentials, so make sure you stay tuned to AllEars for more!

Amazon has new price cuts for iPhones which take select models right back to their Spring Sale lows. The discounts apply to the the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, and the iPhone 16 Pro versions, too. In fact, all the phones in the iPhone 16 series are represented apart from the newest of all, the iPhone 16e, which is the most affordable of the range. What\u2019s more, there are bargains to be had if you\u2019d like the iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Plus, as well. Apple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus prices are down at Amazon. Getty Images Amazon U.K. has discounted the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max by \u00a3100 or more. The deals highlighted in this post were independently selected by the Contributor and do not contain affiliate links. Forbes Apple Intelligence For iPhone To Add Google Gemini In Weeks, Report Claims By David Phelan Let\u2019s start with the iPhone 16. The entry-level model has 128GB storage and comes in four colors, of which three are discounted in this storage level. Choose between pink, teal and white to find the iPhone with 13% off. That takes the price down by \u00a3101, from \u00a3799 ($1,019) to \u00a3698 ($890). Here\u2019s the link for the iPhone 16. MORE FOR YOU Microsoft\u2019s Free Upgrade Offer For 500 Million Windows Users Top Fed Official Confirms The Bank Is Ready To Bail Out Trump \u2018God Of Chaos\u2019 Asteroid: It\u2019s Exactly Four Years Until The Rarest Space Event Of Our Lives If you\u2019re mad about the Ultramarine color, and I couldn\u2019t blame you, there are savings available if you choose the 512GB version. The regular price for this is \u00a31,099 ($1,402) but it has a 9% discount, which also works out at \u00a3101 off, making it \u00a3998 ($1,273). The same price applies for the pink, teal and white finishes. The fifth color, black, is not worth having at the current Amazon price of \u00a31,202.79 for the 128GB storage model. The iPhone 16 with 256GB storage is also not available. Fancy a bigger screen? The iPhone 16 Plus is discounted by 11%, taking its regular \u00a3899 ($1,147) sticker down by \u00a3101 (spotting a pattern here?) to \u00a3798 ($1,018). You only get to choose the white finish at this price, please note. Here\u2019s the iPhone 16 Plus link . There\u2019s more choice for the 256GB storage option, a 10% discount of \u00a3101 brings the \u00a3999 ($1,275) price down to \u00a3898 ($1,146). All colors except black available. The full range of colors is discounted on the largest storage of 512GB. Down from \u00a31,199 ($1,530) by 8% or, you guessed it, \u00a3101, the new price is \u00a31,098 ($1,401) and you can choose between black, pink, teal, ultramarine and white. If you can\u2019t resist the three cameras and titanium frame of the iPhone 16 Pro, these are discounted, too. Here\u2019s the link. All four colors are available for the 128GB storage models. That means Desert Titanium, Black Titanium, Natural Titanium and White Titanium are all 10% off, that means the regular \u00a3999 ($1,308) price is knocked down by \u00a3100 ($131) to \u00a3899 ($1,178). And you\u2019ll notice the magic spell of \u00a3101 off has been broken on this model, though only just. Forbes Apple\u2019s Stealthy New Music Upgrade For Windows PCs Beats Microsoft By David Phelan Same for the 256GB model, which also sees \u00a3100 ($131) off, across the board. Here it\u2019s a 9% discount, taking the \u00a31,099 ($1,439) sticker down to \u00a3999 ($1,308). All four colors available. Step up to 512GB storage and something eerily predictable happens: all four colors available with \u00a3100 ($131) off. This means an 8% price cut, so the regular \u00a31,299 ($1,701) price drops to \u00a31,199 ($1,570). The same \u00a3100 ($131) cut means the regular \u00a31,499 ($1,963) price for the 1TB storage option is \u00a31,399 ($1,832). The biggest phone of all is the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a 6.9-inch display. Check this link and you\u2019ll see a wholly unsurprising discount in place. That\u2019s right, there\u2019s \u00a3100 ($131) off the 256GB model \u2014 the lowest-capacity storage option for the Max \u2014 which reduces the price from \u00a31,199 ($1,570) to \u00a31,099 ($1,439), with all colors ready to ship. The 512GB version also (can you believe it?) shows a \u00a3100 ($131) price cut. That\u2019s a 7% discount and brings the regular \u00a31,399 ($1,832) sticker to \u00a31,299 ($1,701. All colors available. The 1TB option, regularly \u00a31,599 ($2,094) down by \u00a3100 ($131), as you may have guessed. This 6% price cut means you\u2019ll pay \u00a31,499 ($1,963). Lastly, there\u2019s the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. Last year\u2019s standard iPhones may not have all the love expended on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, which arguably took the regular phones closer to the Pro models than before, but they\u2019re still worth considering, especially when the prices are reduced as here. Apple will sell you the iPhone 15 with 128GB storage for \u00a3699. On Amazon ( here\u2019s the link ), all five colors are available for \u00a3598. That\u2019s 14% off and our old friend the $101 discount reappears. The five colors, by the way, are yellow, green, pink, blue and black. Trade up to 256GB and instead of the regular \u00a3799 price you can find all five for \u00a3698. The larger-display iPhone 15 Plus, usually selling for \u00a3799 with 128GB storage, has dropped to \u00a3698, that\u2019s 13% off but only in green and pink. The 256GB storage has dropped from \u00a3899 to, yes, that\u2019s right, \u00a3798, which is an 11% discount. You can choose between blue and black for this deal. The 512GB storage option is available for this larger phone, wih the same \u00a3101 discount, taking the price from \u00a31,099 to \u00a3998. Choose between black and, no, that\u2019s it, just black. Incidentally, if U.S. readers see the price translations and feel the Brits are paying well over the odds compared to prices in the States, remember that U.S. prices are quoted pre-tax and U.K. ones have all sales taxes included, so the disparity isn\u2019t as steep as it looks. And if price rises cut in Stateside because of tariffs, then iPhones could even be cheaper on the other side of the pond one day.

BuzzFeed editor Jenae Sitzes wishes she had bought it sooner: \"After seeing this coffee warmer all over BuzzFeed Shopping and even gifting my dad one for Christmas, I finally decided to buy one for myself.

I was kind of worried it'd be too small for some of my larger mugs, but the center plate is bigger than expected and accommodated every mug in my (very eclectic) collection perfectly.

Getting the chance to finally own the Dragonlance Chronicles in a single hardback is a dream come true. Truth be told, I still have my original mass market paperback releases from 1984. I even bought the Annotated Chronicles way back in the day just for more backstory. This is the core of all those old TSR books that really flooded the market in the 1980s and 1990s (and many more years after that). Or, as my kids say, the late 20th century. But, for those who missed those days due to being born too late, here is the chance to grab an amazing trilogy in a single edition! This particular edition has a new foreword from Joe Manganiello , a known fan of all things Dungeons & Dragons related. I loved the intro as it spoke to the concept of a Dragonlance feature film and all of the work he put in to get one funded and produced. The short preface from co-author Tracy Hickman also gives the reader a bit of personal history from his life and a glimpse of the past from co-author Margaret Weis , as well. Those additions are a nice add-on to the fact that this hardcover has the entire first trilogy packed into it ( Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Dragons of Winter Night, and Dragons of Spring Dawning ). Over a thousand pages of love, loss, tragedy, humor, and so much more. Having all three books in one tome creates a convenience that I am happy to embrace. There are some concerns I have with the quality of the paper and the binding itself, but the longer I live with this new release, the less that matters to me. I do miss the beautiful artwork on those original editions, but the gold and black exterior of this one hearkens back to my high school years. Oddly enough, our mascot was the Golden Dragons, so maybe fate was working its magic over the decades. Regardless of the reason, I am quite ecstatic that I get this, but also that new readers can experience what was for me, the beginning of my deep dive into the world of D&D novels and not just the game itself. The tale itself is a woven tapestry of lives once bound together through friendship, but one that diverged as the companions sought the truths of their time. Sadly, not everyone followed the paths expected. In fact, some were changed in terrible, painful ways while others suffered loss and shame. Our heroes are diverse, coming from not just different backgrounds, but also different races and species. Set in the world of Krynn, this is a time after a horrific change hundreds of years prior, called the Cataclysm. The once peaceful continent of Ansalon is seemingly at war with itself as it comes to terms with a multitude of changes. The gods have abandoned this world, leaving a rift that seems to grow with each passing year. Our heroes split up to find out as much as they could, returning after five years to their hometown of Solace. Even this quiet town has become darker and less friendly, something none among them would have expected. But their meeting will be less celebratory and more of a jumping off point for one of the greatest adventures ever conceived. Tanis the half-elf, the elder dwarf Flint, honorable Sturm Brightblade, mischievous Tasslehoff, and the twins Caramon and Raistlin find themselves in ever-growing trouble almost from the start. But the world hangs in the balance after a chance meeting with a barbarian couple and we bear witness as our motley crew traverses the expansive land seeking artifacts and power to help them defeat that which was thought of as fanciful legends: fear-inspiring dragons. More companions will join them, while still others will seek to eventually go their own way. But this tale is far-reaching and while it begins with these three novels, it blossoms and gives forth a series of books that I have cherished for decades. If I recall correctly, there are more than 150 books that came out over the last 40 years. I cannot swear I have read them all, but I am hard pressed to see a title in there that I do not own or remember reading at some point. So much beauty and fun flow through this long-running franchise. I even have the playable D&D modules of this original series. To say I am a fan is to sell it far short of the truth. This world has long been a fan favorite, and it started with this trilogy. These are not an afterthought, but the real brainchild of a highly successful saga. I refuse to ruin the plot, but even if you think I am exaggerating about this series, the sheer number of releases should speak volumes. Literally! And while the original characters will always hold a special place in millions of hearts, we all have a favorite from one book or another. I will only say that mine is a certain dark elf that bears no resemblance to the Drow elf Drizz\u2019t, even if you forget that it is an entirely different world and book series. I hope this encourages you to check this out if you are new to the world of Dragonlance . But I know that if you are a lifelong fan, you probably already own this and several other books related to it. Amazon has this at more than a third off cover price, as of the writing of this article. But do not be afraid to shop your local independent bookshop like I often do here in central Texas. I am looking at you Fabled in Waco, Texas! Fare ye well, friends. Happy reading! Rediscover the world of Dragonlance with the first three novels in one of the most popular fantasy series of all time\u2014now featuring a new foreword by Joe Manganiello! Dragons. Creatures of legend. Stories told to children. But now dragons have returned to Krynn. The darkness of war and destruction threatens to engulf the land. Then hope appears\u2014a blue crystal staff in the hands of a beautiful barbarian woman.
