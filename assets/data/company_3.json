Yes, there is a smell when you apply the product, but it dissipates almost instantly. In my opinion, it is worth it for the results.

I also had calcium stains on the drain of my bathtub and sink that were a pain to get out. This product erased all of these stains with ease and made it look like they were never there!

I was definitely skeptical and a little nervous when it didn\u2019t seem to be getting noticeably smaller after a week, but then the second week, it started totally disappearing, so make sure to give it some time to work if your bump is on the larger side. If you remain patient and apply it twice a day, it should do the trick!

Consequently, I wore acrylic nails for several years until I got tired of leaving so much money at the nail salon.

I searched for years for a home product to use to save money and time. This is the closest I have been able to get to professional dermaplaning in the convenience of my home, on my time/schedule, and at a fraction of the price.

When my mom mentioned this product to me, I didn\u2019t take her seriously because of the simple fact that we have two completely different hair textures. I never would have thought this brand would work on my hair ... I have never in my 22 years felt my hair like this. I feel like I have a completely different head of hair.

It'll help extend the life of your machine and improve the taste of your coffee. Besides, your most-used kitchen appliance deserves some R-E-S-P-E-C-T. amazon.com Promising review: \"I had never even thought of descaling my 2-year-old Keurig before Amazon suggested it, but this stuff was cheap, I knew I was supposed to descale regularly, and I knew this kind of descaler wouldn't be as hard to rinse out as the smell of vinegar. I honestly wasn't expecting much, but the next morning, it took much less time for the water to heat up, and my coffee tasted twice as strong and rich as it did before descaling, which means the brewing temperature is higher now that the heating element isn't caked with mineral deposits. Now I feel a little silly for drinking mediocre coffee for so long.\" \u2014 Lenore Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a two-pack). 20.

A bottle brush, different kinds of soap, vinegar, EVERYTHING, and there was still a seemingly impenetrable layer of black sludge inside. I let a tablet sit in each of my mugs for an hour or two, and the black sludge rinsed out COMPLETELY without even scrubbing. They look brand new. What a magical product. No weird smell or taste afterward, either. I liked it so much that I used it on another HydroFlask I use primarily to hold my Bloody Mary mix in the fridge.

My dog Molly is a 9-pound mini dachshund whose little chest makes contact with the grass all the time, so her skin gets itchy and irritated. I\u2019ve been bathing her regularly with this shampoo, and it is giving her some relief. No more greasy, flaky skin.

Prepare to be simultaneously disgusted and satisfied because yes, your tongue really is pink underneath all that brownish-yellow gunk! amazon.com Promising review: \"Unfortunately, I, like many, suffer from bad breath and have tried so many things to stop it. I read that sometimes it's the germs on your tongue that can cause it, so I went crazy trying to brush my tongue. Of course, we all know how that ends \u2014 gagging, watery eyes, and it still looks like that gross film is on your tongue. I finally decided that maybe it was time to get a tongue cleaner, and it had to be a stainless steel one because they are easier to clean and sterilize. This product is really easy to use, and I can get very far back on my tongue without activating my gag reflex. Also, it doesn't have the feeling that brushing with a toothbrush does. This cleaner just glides across my tongue, taking all the icky germs and bad breath with it. I love my nice new fresh breath and bolster of confidence!\" \u2014 jordanb Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in packs of two or 12). 32. A jetted tub cleaner so you can get the junk out of your tub and actually be able to have a nice, relaxing bubble bath. There might be plenty of dirt and dead skin cells hiding in those jets, and it has no business sticking around. Simply run your water, pour in some cleaner, and start your jets. amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought a walk-in tub 18 months ago. I was just looking for something to clean it with. I found this product and watched the video reviews. This product is just as advertised! Even better! When you use your air and water jets, you are recycling the tub water you are sitting in. Soap scum, skin cells, and mold buildup in the pipes. This stuff cleans it all out on the first application. 4 oz is all it takes. The first time I used this product, the tub water looked like I had thrown up in my tub. All this gunk was floating in the water. Great product. I will use this every week.\" \u2014 THOMAS O. MCCUTCHEON Get it from Amazon for $18.73 . 33. A carpet cleaner to once and for all make that huge spaghetti stain in the middle of your living room carpet ~disappear~. Just spritz some on the stain, wait a few seconds, and blot it up. It's like magic! amazon.com Promising review: \"It\u2019s a miracle in a bottle. My German shepherd mix decided to pull a black fountain pen out of my purse and chew it to pieces on my beige carpet while I was sleeping \u2014 this cleaner lifted the stain, and now it\u2019s like the devastation my dog caused never happened! As soon as I saw it lifting the ink, I got back on Amazon and bought more bottles. I will never let myself run out of this. I use it in my Bissell carpet cleaner for some crazy good cleaning power. I\u2019ve become that weird lady who goes around singing the praises of a cleaning product. No regrets.\" \u2014 L. Logan Get it from Amazon for $6.88 (also available in multipacks). 34. A shower door cleaner so you can finally get rid of the soap scum and hard water stains and make it so that the place where you clean yourself is, well, clean. It's super quick, easy, and effective and you wanna know the best part? It also leaves behind a coating that helps protect the glass from collecting more grossness over the next few weeks! Less cleaning is ALWAYS a win. amazon.com Promising review: \"This product works beautifully. I tried a lot of products to remove the hard water from my glass shower. I have to admit the first time I used it with a cloth, it was not very effective. The second time I used a nonabrasive sponge for glass, it turned out beautiful just like the first day the glass was installed.\" \u2014 EJP Get it from Amazon for $11.65 . 35. Plus! A grout paint marker to turn that icky brown color between your bathroom (or kitchen) tiles into a bright, clean white. Your floors will look brand-new again \u2014 without a bunch of tedious scrubbing (because who has time for that??). amazon.com This won't clean your grout, but it'll make it look brand-new. Promising review: \"I was pleasantly surprised by how far these went. I did the entire floor of my large master bathroom, plus a little of the shower, with one pen. It is pretty forgiving,g and you have quite a bit of working time before it dries completely. This was not a quick task, but it went faster than I thought it would. I was worried the white would look too bright, but it just makes everything look so much cleaner. Very happy with this product!\" \u2014 Jenelle Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in wide tip). 36. Heavy-duty cleaning wipes that'll help you quickly and easily clean up grease, oil, dirt, ink, makeup, food, and more on pretty much any surface. No need to take a chunk of time out of what you're doing to hunt down the mop, broom, cleaning sprays, etc. amazon.com Promising review: \"I think these wipes are made out of magic because they can clean just about anything with very little effort! One wipe cleaned my ENTIRE BATHTUB, including the hard water buildup and some residual soap scum. The wipe stayed wet for the entire use, and there was absolutely no sweating involved. I hate cleaning, but I was so pumped about the tub, I took wipe #2 to my hood vent, and good golly, it's like it's brand-new. I've told everyone I know to buy these.\" \u2014 JenM Get a 90-pack from Amazon for $14.98 . 37. A Clorox ToiletWand cleaning kit , which includes a wand, caddy, and six disposable refills, so you can eliminate the germs and stains in your toilet without having to reach down in there or touch anything gross. The scrub pads are preloaded with cleaner, so it's both convenient and effective. amazon.com Promising review: \"So, we have a toilet that belongs to the cats. We don't use it, we don't look at it, we like to pretend it does not exist. Even with semi-regular flushing, cat waste is pretty nasty stuff and builds up quickly in the bowl. One of these wands cleaned it up in a single session! Before-and-after pic attached (above).\" \u2014 Whitney Get it from Amazon for $11.98 . 38. A gas range cleaning spray that'll cut through grease with just a simple spray and wipe. Now you don't have to dread when your partner cooks, knowing that they never clean up the grease splatters. This will make it extra easy! amazon.com Here's why BuzzFeed Shopping editor Daniel Boan loves this stuff: \"This stuff is THE TRUTH. My roommate is the best, but let's just say wiping down the stove after cooking is not one of her favorite activities. I'm not particularly fond of doing the dishes, so I guess we're even. Anyway, I spray this on a few times a week, let it sit for about five minutes, then wipe it with a cloth, and it removes EVERYTHING. Like, every little spot of caked-on grease and burnt crumbs come off with just one wipe.\" Get a two-pack from Amazon for $17.98 . 39. A jewelry cleaning stick to restore your bling and have it looking like it did when it was first purchased. This convenient stick is preloaded with a formula that helps to remove dirt and oils, reduces fine scratches, repels grime, and provides shine! If your engagement ring has seen better days, but you don't want to spend the money on professional cleaning, this will help it get its sparkle back. amazon.com Promising review: \"This little pen brush is incredible! I wasn't sure if it would work well on my emerald engagement ring since it's mostly advertised for diamonds, but I thought I'd give it a try. I have been wearing the ring since getting engaged in October, and even though I had it cleaned at the jeweler's in April, it just didn't seem as bright as it was when it was new, and I thought it would just always be a little cloudy. But after cleaning it once with the Dazzle Stik, I was blown away by the difference \u2014 it looks as bright and sparkly as when I first got it! I'm so glad I didn't buy an ultrasonic cleaner, since this is so much less expensive and easier and gentler. It took me less than a minute to clean, and I can do it whenever I want! And it's honestly better than when the jeweler cleaned it. So thrilled!\" \u2014 KFray Get it from Amazon for $9.48 . 40. A bestselling and surprisingly inexpensive Arvazallia argan oil hair mask that'll strengthen and restore weak and damaged hair. It'll make your locks look shiner and feel healthier (and who doesn't want shiny, healthy hair??). Sure, there are a lot of hair masks out there, but more than 300 reviewers claim this is one of the BEST. amazon.com Reviewers with 4C hair , curly hair , and straight, dyed hair rave about this! Promising review: \"My hair is very thin and curly. The ends are damaged from heat and color, causing my hair to look even more unruly. I do oil treatments once a week and only wash my hair two to three times a week, but NOTHING has made my hair feel like this product does. There is an immediate difference as soon as this product touches my hair. It leaves my hair feeling so silky, even after I rinse it out and dry my hair.\" \u2014 Melissa Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . 41. A rubber broom basically guaranteed to make all of your floors look brand-spanking new. The 100% natural rubber brush picks up hair (both pet and human) like a magnet and easily gathers it from carpets, rugs , hardwood, and linoleum. Plus, it has a built-in squeegee on the other side to assist you with liquid spills! Emma Lord/BuzzFeed Promising review: \"I have two dogs \u2014 a terrier mix and a short-hair dachshund mix. I have a navy woven couch that LOVES my dachshund's fur. I have tried pretty much everything to get the fur out \u2014 traditional lint roller, those blue fuzzy lint rollers, special vacuum attachments, etc. The terrier's fur comes out great with all of those options. The dachshund's fur, much like the dachshund herself, remains stubbornly on my couch. I got this product as the new 'let's see if it works' item of the month with low expectations. THE FUR ACTUALLY CAME OUT GUYS. It acts like a broom for my couch \u2014 sweeping the fur (with some elbow grease) basically onto the floor where I vacuum it up! Give this a try if my story sounds pretty similar to yours!\" \u2014 Janielle Get it from Amazon for $19.76 . 42. A wrinkle releaser and fabric freshening spray for mornings when you really don't have time to iron, but you also really need to wear THAT specific shirt for your work presentation. amazon.com Promising review: \"This is literally like an iron in a bottle. It's fantastic. This morning, my shirt had a crease from being folded, but I didn't have time to change, so I misted just one spray on the shirt, shook it out while I was wearing it, and the crease was gone. I cannot express how much I love this! I spray it over my shirts and shake them out a couple of times, then hang them u,p and they are completely wrinkle-free, and it smells like everything just came right out of the laundry, which is also a plus.\" \u2014 Kayla Get a two-pack, plus a travel-size from Amazon for $16.99 (available in five scents and various packs and sizes). 43. An all-purpose scrubber kit \u2014 it comes with three different brushes you can attach to your drill and use to remove any of that hard-to-clean grossness that's caked up on your stove, grill, shower, or floor. What would have taken you hours to scrub can now be accomplished in minutes! You're welcome. amazon.com And if you don't have a drill, here's one on Amazon for $39.59 \u2014 it has over 16,000 5-star ratings! Promising review: \"I bought this on a whim because my walk-in shower is just a pain to clean. I'm 51, and I guess I've just been old school with how I clean, hand scrubbing for years. T he FIRST time I used this to clean my shower, it took five minutes, AND it scrubbed my shower more clean than it has been in years. In the corners, the floor, the glass door...everything came out squeaky clean. I'm NEVER cleaning my shower by hand again.\" \u2014 Terry Get it from Amazon for $18.95 (available in six bristle stiffnesses).

Emporium Make it easier on yourself, by getting these cheaper versions of pricey Disney souvenirs that we found. DISCLOSURE: This post may contain affiliate links, which means when you click a link and make a purchase, we receive a commission. One thing you\u2019re guaranteed to see at Disney World, are little ones launching bubbles everywhere out of their bubble wands. Join the fun with a cheaper option, with this Disney Mickey Bubble Wand ! \u00a9Amazon Bubble wands are extremely popular at the Parks, they\u2019re one of the most sold items. This bubble wand isn\u2019t much different. The Mickey head shaped wand features sound and lighting effects \u2014 it will blink blue, green, and red. The wand also comes with solution. We think this is a great alternative for kids! You can order these before your trip and already have them ready to go for the parks! View on Amazon This Mickey and Friends Autograph Book is a great deal for those who love to get signatures from their favorite Disney characters! Don\u2019t worry about getting a more expensive autograph book, when you can get one like this. \u00a9Amazon It comes with a Mickey pen and some alphabet stickers, so you can personalize you\u2019re book. We love the cover featuring Mickey and his pals (and sweetheart). The fireworks and castle give it a nice pop as well. Best of all, the item is 46% off at the moment! This one is under $10. The ones in the parks will run you over $20. View on Amazon You\u2019ve probably seen a lot of Disney goers rocking this portable charger. The FuelRod Portable Charger Kit is a must-have! The kit comes with two chargers, and includes all cables and adapters needed for you phone. We LOVE using portable chargers! The kit does come with a rechargeable backup power bank as well. The cool thing about these is you can swap dead one\u2019s for new recharged ones. Just find a kiosk located at different spots around Disney World, and swap out. These are about half the price if you buy them before your trip! View on Amazon Here\u2019s a little shopping hack for you Disney lovers. If you look at the Disney Store online, you can sometimes find Disney ears for a little bit of a discount. We especially love these Minnie Mouse Polka Dot Ears ! \u00a9DisneyStore The reason they can be cheaper online than in person, is because they are often a part of sales. Whereas they almost never go on sale at a Disney Park! These ones are currently $10 off. View Online Like we mentioned with the ears, the same can be said for Spirit Jersey esc tops. It\u2019s always smart to look online first before shopping at the park, because you never know if the one you like could be on sale. Take a look at this Disney World Logo Pullover Sweater ! \u00a9DisneyStore Although it isn\u2019t a typical Disney iconic Spirit Jersey, this is pretty close to. This sweater has the Disney World logo at the front, and has the classic full name print on the back. It\u2019s available at an amazing price right now! View Online The same thing can also be said about designer items \u2014 crazy online shopping hack right! Designer items are very rarely ever marked down at the Parks, but online that\u2019s a different story. We love the style of this Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck Backpack ! \u00a9DisneyStore This bag is designed by Lily Pulitzer ! We love the Hawaiin type theme to the backpack. The colors really pop and mesh well together, and the subtle add of Minnie and Daisy is a chefs kiss. You won\u2019t believe the price it\u2019s going for right now! You\u2019re going to want this for your next Disney trip. View Online You\u2019ve probably caught onto the trend. If you buy Disney souvenirs online, you have a good chance of running into a sale. Whereas in the parks, you most likely won\u2019t find a sale. This applies even to ornaments, like this Cinderella Sketchbook Ornament ! \u00a9DisneyStore We love this ornament capturing the moment Cinderella leaves the ball. She\u2019s got her glass slipper in hand, and the clock has struck midnight. Even Jaq and Gus are featured on the ornament. It\u2019s available online for UNDER $10!

A female jogger is firing back after being criticized for carrying a gun while working out in public. Mikaela Dieppa made her open carry admission in a TikTok clip posted earlier this week, which has clocked up more than 4.2 million views. The mother-of-one, who lives in South Carolina, initially showed off her gun holster as she detailed what she wears while jogging. \u201c[This is my] run outfit of the day. I\u2019m open carrying,\u201d Dieppa declared, flaunting her fashionable fit ahead of her workout. \u201cMy holster is from Amazon, my sports bra and shorts are from Lululemon\u2026 and my favorite running shoes, I\u2019m wearing my Hokas.\u201d 3 Mikaela Dieppa rocks a gun holster as part of her fashionable workout fit. tiktok/@mikaeladieppa Explore More Travelers reveal their most bizarre culture shocks when visiting other countries: 'Never get used to it' Hotel guest who paid extra to see the ocean appalled by 'inner city' view \u2014 staff told her to 'lean over the balcony' Tourist couple caught having sex in the middle of the street @mikaeladieppa Protect yourself ladies \ud83d\udc9b #opencarry #womanrunner #gunsafety #runningtips \u266c original sound \u2013 Mikaela Dieppa She defended her decision to be openly armed while exercising, saying: \u201cFor all the people who say I should be concealed carrying when I am on my run, you\u2019re probably not a female who has men slow down and stop to watch them running.\u201d Dieppa claimed that leering men quickly leave her alone when they realize she\u2019s carrying a gun. \u201cProtect yourself ladies,\u201d the locked and loaded brunette captioned the clip. Dieppa told The Post on Saturday: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m scared or paranoid, it\u2019s a fact that women get assaulted in broad daylight all the time, even when taking precautions.\u201d As for the gun, the runner says: \u201cI\u2019d rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.\u201d The mom revealed that other women have asked whether they should take similar safety measures, and Dieppa advises: \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll need it [the gun], but chances aren\u2019t zero.\u201d 3 The gun-toting mama defended her decision to open carry after being criticized by TikTok trolls. tiktok/@mikaeladieppa Dieppa\u2019s exercise accessory divided viewers, with some cheering her decision to flaunt the firearm. \u201cEverybody should open carry \u2026.I think everybody should have a gun on them in public,\u201d one defender declared. \u201cCrime would go away.\u201d \u201cOpen carry every time,\u201d another proponent proclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t start nothing, there won\u2019t be nothing.\u201d However, others said Dieppa\u2019s desire to arm herself while exercising was a sad indictment of the American way of life. 3 Dieppa encouraged other women to protect themselves while working out in public.

A cordless grass trimmer that'll help you tackle hard-to-reach areas in your garden bed or simply get the job done if you are the proud owner of a tiny patch of grass. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This tool is awesome and it lasts a long time for trimming around your plants. I love it and recommend for any one who needs to trim around their plants and/or vegetable tree. Mine is a banana tree and was not kept trimmed around it but after getting this tool I'm able to trim around without damaging or making a mess around it.\" \u2014 IC Get it from Amazon for $31.99 (available in three colors). 2. A variety of sunflower seeds to transform that boring patch of dirt in your yard into a photo shoot\u2013worthy garden without the stress of hand selecting which flowers to plant. Alexa, play \"Sunflower\" by Harry Styles. www.amazon.com Created by Nature is a small business! Promising review: \"Planted a handful of the seeds in our front lawn area. Few months later, and we had a spectacular color array. Great flowers!\" \u2014 Shane Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . 3. A standing weeder (without the chemicals!) in case you've found your dream home, but, unfortunately, it came with a grass full of dandelions. Unwind after a busy day at the office with some therapeutic weeding that won't hurt your back. \ud83d\udc4d www.amazon.com Made with a bamboo handle and powder-coated steel, it uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. Grampa's Weeder is a small business! Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy, has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard, and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun, but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 4. A programmable timer to work some Fairy Godmother-like magic on your hose and transform it into a sprinkler. Bibbidi, Bobbidi, Boo-tiful lawn! Amazon Reviewers mention it's worth using this product with a water hammer arrester . Promising review: \"These timers have been around for a long time. My dad used them for his garden for years without any issue. The batteries last a long time in these things as well. I\u2019m able to program what days of the weeks to water, how frequently (every 12 hours for twice a day), and how long to water each time. Then just leave the faucet on and you\u2019re good to go. If you want to do another watering on hot days or use the hose for another purpose just click the manual button to trigger a manual watering no need to disconnect.\" \u2014 Taylor Get it from Amazon for $35.81 . 5. A row of colorful flower pots with draining holes and hooks that'll brighten up your deck with very minimal effort. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These are adorable. I love the colors.

A fast-acting lawn repair formula made up of grass seeds, mulch, and soil amendment will undo all the damage your beloved doggo (who, obviously, can't help but pee all over your grass) has done to the yard. Now, back to trying to teach Fido *not* to dig up the new grass... www.amazon.com Promising review : \"I used this in the spring to fill out our lawn more, and it worked great! I was worried because I feel like you always hear grass seed horror stories, but I just raked our lawn good, spread seeds all over, and watered it once (sometimes twice) per day and it filled the lawn in beautifully! \" \u2014 Mariah Get it from Amazon for $16.44+ (available in five sizes). 7. A hedge trimmer that'll ensure your neighbors will be peeking over your fence to get a glimpse at how fabulous those bushes look. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have hesitated for years to buy a hedge trimmer but took the plunge on this one. I am pleasantly surprised; lightweight, easy to handle, cuts my shrubs back easily, and trims my 10-foot tall Cyprus cedar with ease!! I'm 76, wish I had bought one years ago!!\" \u2014 George Goddling Get it from Amazon for $39 . 8. Pruning shears , for anyone who has successfully created their own magical rose garden in their yard. Better get yourself a glass jar too to display it like in Beauty and the Beast . Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I purchased these as a gift for my mother who gardens extensively. She thanked me again for them today, declaring that these were the best pruners she has ever owned (she has been at it over 50 years). She cuts the branches off her trees and shrubs, then further trims them into small sections to fit in the recycle trash bags. It is her great joy to work in the yard made even my pleasant through the use of these pruners.\" \u2014 A. Kelly Get it from Amazon for $18.95. 9. And a long-handled lopper to help you can trim any overgrown bushes or trees in your yard, a must-have for anyone who isn't Edward Scissorhands. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Light, easy to use for pruning my trees, but sturdy. Pruning is effortless. So well-engineered. I can't recommend these enough. And they're affordable. My favorite garden tool now. I don't like heavy tools that I can't maneuver or hurt my hands. This is perfect.\" \u2014 Patsy Get them from Amazon for $28.05+ (available in five styles). 10. A galvanized steel planter bed to bring a bit of organization to your yearly garden of veggies and herbs \u2014 this will keep 'em all housed in one easy-to-tend-to spot instead of plopping them directly into the ground. www.amazon.com I have similar garden beds in my yard! I like how it showcases the vegetable garden itself instead of just digging out a spot in our lawn. We had success with our veggies last year, so my husband and I invested in a third planter for this year. Promising review : \"This raised bed is very affordable. The bed looks thin and flimsy at first, but once it is set up, it is very sturdy even though it is very light to carry around empty. I also appreciate that this is a foot tall and not too shallow like some other raised beds being sold . This is an excellent product and I would recommend it highly for what you are paying for.\" \u2014 JT Get it from Amazon for $49.99 . 11. A Scotts seed spreader you'll adore because 1. it comes fully assembled (thankfully) and 2. it'll ensure your grass seed and fertilizer are spread nice and evenly without an extra effort required. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This model is definitely a cut above the other spreaders made by Scott. It is quite well constructed and has lots of nice features like a large hopper, four drop holes, and dual spreader mechanisms. The wheels on this are very nice as well and the edge guard feature works well. Very easy and effective to use and should provide years of use if maintained properly. Beats the pants off of every other spreader I have used. And it's attractive to boot!\" \u2014 Gila Monster Get it from Amazon for $44.97+ (available in four styles). 12. And a seeding square kit , so planting your lil' sprouts won't turn into a game of guess and check.

The holes are color coded to let you know exactly where to plant seeds of different varieties. Promising review: \"Love this thing! I have been gardening for a while and this takes all of the guess work out of spacing . I used this for the first time this spring using the planting chart/guide and it has worked out perfectly. I have had little to no weeds (I mean come on, you're gonna get some weeds). Planting per the Seed Square will for the most part choke out the weeds, while promoting growth for the plants. I even used this to plant growing plants and not just seeds. Just put the square on the ground used the stick to mark the spot and dug a hole where it was marked. Simple enough. Would highly recommend. Super easy!\" \u2014 Jennifer Geisel Get it from Amazon for $29.95 . 13. And vegetable, fruit, and herb markers to help you *actually* keep track of what you planted where \u2014 each stick is individually sold and with over 40 options to choose from you should have no problem finding exactly what you need to keep your garden in check.

My Little Belleville / Etsy My Little Belleville is a small business based in Salt Lake City, Utah that sells kitchenware, stationery, and other home goods. Promising review: \"Such a fun way to add more of a thrill into our gardening skills. One set was for my daughter and one for a friend who shares the green thumb phenomena. Adorable designs.\" \u2014 Barbara Get them from My Little Belleville on Etsy for $17.25 (available in seven styles). 16. Or garden gloves with claws that'll make you feel like the Lady Gaga of gardening and make digging in the dirt both easier and more fashionable. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"If you're like me, I typically ditch the gloves when I'm weeding because I can't get a good hold on the smaller weeds. Not with these gloves! They help me dig up those small weeds quickly. I thought I'd have a hard time picking things up because of the claws, but no. They make weeding so much quicker, and save my nails and hands in the process.\" \u2014 MomOfR&D Get them from Amazon for $6.37 (available in four colors). 17. A scent-free mosquito repellent to keep those lil' bloodsucking buggers at bay while you're trying to plant your daisies or pick your cherry tomatoes. Amazon This device uses scent-free repellent mats using naturally occurring repellents found in plants to rid of mosquitoes. Promising review: \"It doesn't smell. It doesn't make noise. It doesn't get hot. It just clears the mosquitos and only mosquitoes! I am the person a mosquito will find from miles away even in my house. The only one they find in a room full of people. I live in a tropical climate and never have a moment's peace in my garden. I've used sprays, foggers, candles, torches, the list goes on. This is the first time I've been able to sit on my patio in peace, even the cat was safe. Already ordered another for a friend and put the refills on subscribe and save.\" \u2014 J&J Get it from Amazon for $17.99+ (available in 13 colors). 18. A soaker hose you can attach to the hose you already own to provide your bushes, plants, and trees with the shower they've always dreamt of (especially during those too-hot summer days). Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought a couple of different soaker hoses and this is the best by far. Unlike the rubbery ones that are heavier and more difficult to intertwine and stay where you place them within your plantings, these are easy to curve around, reposition, or remove . They have clamps to securely connect the hose at the hose ends, which helps avoid leaks or breaks. By comparison, the other kind that has the texture of recycled tires, without clamps, leaked at the connection points and disconnected/failed, resulting in the separation of the hose from the hose ends. Any leaking tends to negate the whole function of the soaker hose. In contrast, this style and brand provides a steady, consistent drip along the hose exactly what I want. So far, durability has been good, and the hose will fold up nicely for storage during the winter months.\" \u2014 Gail Get it from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in seven sizes). 19. A soil test kit to relay the moisture in your plant's soil as well as its pH and light levels so you'll know once and for when it needs to be watered. www.amazon.com This device has two needles to ensure accuracy and doesn't require batteries. Just push it 2\u20134 inches into the ground and select what you want to test for. Promising review: \"I have A LOT of plants, with varied water and light exposure requirements. They would probably all be dead from drought or overwatering if not for this little gadget. So simple to use. I recommend it to my fellow plant-lovers in our social media group.\" \u2014 M. Brooks Get it from Amazon for $7.99 . 20. Knee pads you can count on to make the many hours you typically spend gardening on a Saturday morning a bit more comfortable \u2014 a must-have for anyone whose knees simply aren't what they used to be. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These are the best knee pads I have ever used. They allow me to stay on my knees for an extended period of time without getting uncomfortable. I have worn them for 9-hour working days without any issues with fit, adjustment, or comfort. They have great cushioning and are very comfortable, but in my opinion what really makes them better than most other knee pads on the market is the fact that they have two adjustable straps with slip buckles instead of one of the straps being Velcro . \u2014 Shannon Huett Get them from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in two styles). 21. An expandable garden hose to help you water your grass, the vegetables you planted and prayed will actually grow, and your flower bed without worrying about any kinks getting in the way. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Have used this for about three weeks, watering flowers, grass and washing cars. Have used it almost every day in some way or another. It's very light, easy to maneuver, and doesn't kink. However, I think that's because I followed the directions on the box for how to unwind it for the first time. When I was first unraveling, it kinked in multiple places, so I had to carefully unravel and lay it out fully extended before I even hooked it up to the water source. Has been kink-free ever since.\" \u2014 Sean Cotter Get it from Amazon for $10.06+ (available in seven sizes). 22. An adjustable gardening bench complete with padding for your knees and handles on the sides to assist you in getting up from the crouched position you've likely been in for a *tad* too long while tending to your veggies. It can even be turned into a seat so you can take a true break! www.amazon.com Promising reviews: \"This is great for the garden. It keeps my knees out of the stickers, and the padding is very comfortable, it helps me get up and down \u2014 it is easy to maneuver around the garden and in between the rows. I haven't tried sitting on it, but I'm heavy, and it feels very sturdy under me. Pockets deep enough for tools and seed packets, easy to remove and wash if necessary.\" \u2014 Cpt Dragon \"I bought this for my mother as she had knee surgery, and now she can sit on it while working in her flower and vegetable boxes. Definitely will purchase it again.\" \u2014 Johnnette Murray Get it from Amazon for $23.99 . 23. A plant supporter that'll give your tomato plants and bushes a bit more support so they can grow big and tall \u2014 since they're powder-coated in green they wont' ruin your garden's *~aesthetic~*. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These plant supports each consist of two semi circles that fit together to encircle the plant. I have two snake plants that are getting taller and needed support. These plant stakes are working perfectly . They can easily be inserted into the soil to the desired height, and the green color obscures their appearance. My plants look prettier and stronger now that they are standing tall.\" \u2014 A.Consumer Get a pack of four from Amazon for $14.99+ (also available in an eight-pack). 24. A garden colander to fill up with all of the fruits and veggies you've worked so hard to grow from little seedlings \u2014 wash 'em off outside with the hose to prevent getting dirt all over your kitchen. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I got this for my elderly parents. They always put out a small garden. I thought this would be perfect for them to gather and carry their vegetables in. Another good part is you can rinse them in it, too! My mom said it was too pretty to use for that, but she uses it. It\u2019s convenient!\" \u2014 Samantha Bastin Get it from Amazon for $19.29+ (available in two colors). 25. A pack of seeds that contain, basically, any kind of vegetable you'd want to grow in your garden \u2014 beets, cucumbers, cabbage, butternut squash, and more.

Organo Republic is a small business! Promising review : \"I purchased it for my mother as a gift and I absolutely love the product. Huge variety and very affordable price! The package looks great and each seed bag is individually labeled along with a QR that takes you directly to all the information you need pertaining to that type of vegetables. Love it.\" \u2014 V. G Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (also available in a a variety of 15 and 25 veggie seeds). 26.

Each tool has a nonslip ergonomic handle to make long hours of planting easier!

All my plants look full and healthy with little to no effort on my part! I am so amazed that for teacher gifts this year, I am giving terrariums and will include a shaker of Joyful Dirt to go with each. If you have any trouble keeping plants alive, this is the solution.\" \u2014 KB13 Get a bottle from Amazon for $19.95 . 28. A pack of bamboo garden stakes available in an array of thickness levels that'll support your plants and veggies as they grow. Reach for the sky, babies! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Highly recommend buying these bamboo sticks. I used them to make tomato cages and also to provide support for my climbing vines. They are long enough and quite sturdy. They also look natural. I do not like the sight of metal or plastic tomato cages in a garden. So these blend in harmoniously with all the other plants in my garden\" \u2014 S R Get a 25-pack from Amazon for $21.11 . 29. A weather-resistant cedar pathway you can roll out alongside your prettiest garden bed or just anywhere you tend to walk so often the grass tends to get a bit torn up.

Promising review: \"We are using outdoors at an animal sanctuary. The cats love to sleep on them and they do keep the wetter pathways dry under your feet. They are lasting quite well and although not cheap by any means, they are standing up to cats and people walking on them all day long. They are surviving both rain and sun and wind. We will be purchasing more.\" \u2014 susan osako Get an 8-foot path from Amazon for $69.99 . 30.

It was specifically a Mother's Day gift, but it really would be such a wonderful and thoughtful gift for anyone who likes to plant, garden, and accessorize with vintage charm . Its size is about to my knee (I'm 5-foot-6) and VERY sturdy. My mother has it outside on our porch for her herbs. It doesn't take up much space but can easily be indoors or outdoors. It's currently part of her outdoor patio furniture grouping and looks charming. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to bring a little smile to any planter or gardener in your life.\" \u2014 Jennifer J. Get it from Amazon for $51.99+ (available in black or bronze). 31.

The previous owners already had a very impressive garden. Me being new to the scene, I wanted to learn as much as possible to keep up my garden beautiful, fresh, and healthy. This book has everything a first timer like myself could need. From plans, designs, sowing, pruning etc. I was also excited about the fruit and vegetable section, as I plan to grow my own. I definitely recommend the Complete Gardener\u2019s Guide book. It just arrived today and I\u2019ve been flipping through bunny earring pages all night.

Shuls, Real Clear Wire Skip to content The \u2018learn to code\u2019 fad is done: Why schools should educate for citizenship By James V. Shuls, Real Clear Wire April 12, 2025 Within the past decade or so we have witnessed something remarkable in education \u2013 the rise and fall of a fad we were promised would revolutionize K-12 education. In the 2010s, tech moguls and others began pushing schools to teach students coding skills, often at the expense of other topics. In 2013, Code.org launched with the claim that every student should learn to code. States began promoting computer science as a core subject. By 2016, President Obama put his weight behind the movement with the Computer Science for All initiative. Fast forward to today, and the experts now tell us students may no longer need those once-prized coding skills. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has said the rise of artificial intelligence is making programming skills less relevant. In a leaked memo, Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman reportedly stated that AI would likely replace most software engineers. Most recently, entrepreneur and former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya echoed these claims: \u201cThe engineer\u2019s role will be supervisory, at best, within 18 months.\u201d What does Palihapitiya suggest students study instead? \u201cPhilosophy, psychology, history, physics, and English writing.\u201d Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! The coding fad follows a well-established pattern. A movement is launched with great fanfare, grows rapidly, pushes for widespread reforms, and then fades into irrelevance. Before coding, there was the 21st century \u201cskills\u201d craze, in which schools were told they needed to prepare students for jobs that didn\u2019t yet exist. The recurring theme of many fads in education is their departure from the timeless purposes of education. Rather than cultivating the intellectual and moral virtues necessary for self-government, they focus on workforce readiness. But to sustain a constitutional republic, the public must have both skills. This lesson is clear if we turn to the women of the Founding era. On August 14, 1776 \u2013 barely a month after the Declaration of Independence was signed \u2013 Abigail Adams wrote to her husband John, responding to his complaints about the poor education of young men: \u201cIf you complain of neglect of Education in sons, what shall I say with regard to daughters, who every day experience the want of it?\u201d Most women at the time were not given a proper classical education. They did not read the Greek and Roman poets or moral philosophers. They were unfamiliar with Virgil, Ovid, or leading English thinkers like John Milton and John Locke. Instead, they were taught what we might call \u201c18th-century skills\u201d \u2013 needlework, music, drawing, and etiquette. Abigail Adams knew that an education that focused on domestic tasks or job preparation was insufficient for a free and self-governing society. \u201cIf we mean to have Heroes, Statesmen and Philosophers,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwe should have learned women.\u201d It was exactly that kind of education, rooted in the classics, that propelled several leading women of the time to prominence. Mercy Otis Warren, tutored in classical literature alongside her brothers, authored poetry and satirical plays that supported the Revolution and stirred the affections of the colonists. A similar story can be told of the enslaved poet Phillis Wheatley, who inspired the young nation through her verse. Influenced by the evangelical minister George Whitefield, Wheatley\u2019s enslavers provided her with a classical education alongside their own children. Upon receiving a poem from Wheatley, George Washington wrote, \u201cThe style and manner exhibit a striking proof of your great poetical talents.\u201d Adams, Warren, and Wheatley stood out because they were educated for citizenship . That\u2019s what an education grounded in the classics \u2013 the best that has been written and thought in human history \u2013 can do. It produces people equipped to think deeply, to reason morally, and to lead wisely. Americans intuitively yearn for this type of education. In a recent poll of more than 2,400 people conducted by the Institute for Governance and Civics at Florida State University, participants were asked what would make U.S. education better. The most popular responses \u2013 selected by roughly 85% of respondents \u2013 included requiring schools to teach the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and mandating an approach to civics that focuses on the Constitution. Seventy-eight percent supported requiring students to demonstrate competence in American history to graduate high school. And 67% favored an education focused on the great texts of Western Civilization \u2013 the very texts Adams, Warren, and Wheatley read. It may be time to move on from coding, but the danger is that we\u2019ll simply replace it with yet another skill set that will soon become obsolete. That would be short-sighted. Today\u2019s students must be trained for the job market \u2013 and also prepared for the responsibilities of self-government. Job skills change. Technologies fade. But an education grounded in civic understanding is timeless and can provide long-term stability to our republic. James V. Shuls, Ph.D., is the Head of K-12 Education Reform at the Institute for Governance and Civics at Florida State University.

Reuters reports that the company, which makes phone cases, power banks, adapters, cables, and more, raised prices on a fifth of its products since Thursday. The move comes as the company passes the cost of US tariffs onto its US-based customers. Some 127 Anker products have seen an average increase of 18% since Thursday last week, with the majority of those occurring after Monday, April 7, when U.S. President Donald Trump added an extra 50% import duty on Chinese goods, according to data from e-commerce services provider SmartScout. Reuters notes that, on an investor call earlier in the week, Anker had said that it was able to raise prices \u201cas it had bargaining power and because its rivals were mainly Chinese and under similar tariff pressure, but did not provide specifics.\u201d Ultimately, more companies could well choose to follow suit. Tariffs make it more costly for companies to bring goods from specific countries into the United States. One way that those companies can negate the additional costs while protecting their profits is to increase prices, effectively passing the cost of the tariffs onto customers. The result is that US-based customers pay more for products as a result of the tariffs that were imposed by its leaders.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16. Review the configuration of all devices.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

Discover SCENE Jianwei Xun, the supposed Hong Kong philosopher whose book \"Hypnocracy\" claims Elon Musk and President Donald Trump use utopian promises and empty language, never really existed, at least not physically. Instead, the acclaimed author was a \"collaborative\" creation between Andrea Colamedici, an Italian publisher, and two AI tools \u2013 Claude from Anthropic and ChatGPT from OpenAI. \"I wanted to write a book that would help people better understand the new ways power manifests itself,\" Colamedici told Decrypt . But it wasn't until after an investigative report from L'Espresso that Xun's website was updated to acknowledge the experiment, snapshots from Wayback Machine reviewed by Decrypt show. Still, the book received critical acclaim. L\u2019Espresso reports that L\u2019Opinion , a French daily, had detailed how President Emmanuel Macron had \u201cappreciated\u201d Xun\u2019s writings. Earlier in February, a roundtable at the World AI Cannes Festival extensively discussed Xun\u2019s ideas. \u00c9ditions Gallimard, a leading French publisher, has committed to a new translation from the Italian original, after the first edition in French from Philosophie Magazine. A Spanish translation from Editorial Rosamer\u00f3n is slated for release on April 20. Vibe philosophy? Xun was \"an exercise in ontological engineering,\" Colamedici explained in a post-revelation interview with Le Grand Continent . While this experiment with AI looked novel, critics point out the book could be in trouble. The European Union's AI Act , approved in March 2024, considers failure to label AI-generated content a serious violation \u2013 a requirement critics claim Colamedici's experiment disregarded. In previous versions of its bio, Xun was described as a \"Hong Kong-born cultural analyst and philosopher\" who studied at \u201cDublin University.\u201d That wasn\u2019t true. According to an anonymous source from the University College of Dublin's philosophy department, no person named \"Jianwei Xun\" exists in their database or those of other Dublin-based universities. \"The fact that the author had inverted the Chinese order 'surname-name' was an immediate red flag,\" Laura Ruggieri, a Hong Kong-based researcher, told Decrypt , explaining how she spotted inconsistencies as early as February. Ruggieri previously taught semiotics\u2014the study of symbols and signs\u2014at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. She asked her colleagues about Xun. Nobody knew who that was. \u201cNot a single one of them has ever met Xun or heard his name,\u201d Ruggieri said. \u201cIf Colamedici had used his real name and admitted that AI had written the book, no one would have bought it.\u201d Responding to those allegations to Decrypt , Colamedici claimed these were deliberate clues \"left for those willing to question and investigate,\u201d claiming the revelation was \"predetermined.\" \u201cWe actually did everything possible to make Xun\u2019s non-existence evident to anyone with even minimally inquisitive eyes,\u201d Colamedici said. Colamedici insists that AI did not write the book. Instead, Claude and ChatGPT \"served as interlocutors.\" In the words of Xun The book describes itself as a \"journey into the fractured mirror of modern reality,\" and discusses how Musk and Trump have constructed an alternate reality through obsessive repetition. It was written \"for those who suspect that the world they see is only a shadow of something far more complex,\" its Amazon blurb claims. Xun's thoughts center on \"hypnocracy,\" describing a regime that exerts control through \"algorithmic modulation\" of collective consciousness instead of censorship. In English: fake news. Xun claims that Trump's speeches and social media posts create conditions of uncertainty. Trump \"empties language: his words, repeated endlessly, become empty signifiers, devoid of meaning yet charged with hypnotic power,\" Xun wrote. Xun claims Musk makes promises \u201cdestined not to materialize,\u201d by \u201cflooding our imagination\u201d with ventures such as space colonization and neural interfaces. \"Together they modulate desires, rewrite expectations, colonize the unconscious,\" the AI philosopher wrote. Spokepeople for Musk and Trump did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.

A flexible drain snake that'll get out all those clumps of hair and gunk so the bathtub stops filling up past your ankles every time you shower. Just stick it down the drain, twist it, and the ridges at the end will catch all the goop, making sure it all comes out. Amazon, www.amazon.com This pack contains a reusable handle and five single-use heads that you just remove and dispose of after handling your clogged pipes. Promising review: \"Wow. Best thing ever. Seriously. I have had tweezers and sticks and plumbers and chemicals trying to get my master sink to drain. Plumber even said I need an entirely new faucet to get the drain plug part because they don't sell those separately. Well, I have two sinks, a tub, and shower that all match so that was not a valid solution. Doubt I can find the same model. So I bought this thing, stuffed it down, and pulled up hair and black muck. Did it about eight times quickly, ran the water, went right down the drain. Seriously. This is the best tool ever and the best $20 I have ever spent. Everyone with a sink needs this tool. Seriously.\" \u2014 juliejules Get a five-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in other sets and styles). 2. A pack of 120 retainer cleaner tablets because it turns out your Invisalign is supposed to be ~clear~ (it also works on mouthguards and dentures!). All you do is drop a tablet into warm tap water, let your dental device soak for a few minutes, and voila! \u2014 it'll kill bacteria and remove the buildup that's causing discoloration and unpleasant odors. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I really loved this product. I am currently waiting for a new Invisalign set. My old Invisalign needed to be cleaned. I read the reviews and decided to purchase. OMG, it worked! They had a fresh taste and were clean. I wish I had found this product sooner. I did let them soak overnight only because I had been wearing them for the last four months. Nothing happened to Invisalign; there was no weakness or anything. Just very clean and fresh. If I could have given the product 10 stars, I would have. \" \u2014 Lisa R. Get 120 tablets from Amazon for $18.81 (available in five pack sizes). 3. A new pair of workout leggings to replace the super pilled ones you wear three times a week. They're made with a thick, buttery soft fabric (no one is seeing those hot pink undies) and have ~pockets~ so you don't have to carry your phone around the gym. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"THESE...are the best leggings I have ever worn in my entire life! They are so smooth and comfortable. Soft as butter. They fit perfectly. It almost feels like you're naked but they feel somehow insulated and cozy. Stretchy and made of amazingly durable quality. I need to get more colors!\" \u2014 Alexandra Shick Get them from Amazon for $24.98 (available in women's sizes XS\u2013XXL, in three inseam lengths, and 45 colors). 4. A pack of AirPods cleaning putty because it's so embarrassing when you want to share earbuds with someone, but yours are coated in wax and dust. Plus, it's soooo satisfying to squish the lil' square into your speaker and see all the gunk it pulls out \u2014 and then you get to enjoy clearer, louder-sounding music! www.amazon.com Before you toss your tech in the trash, at least give this a try. Promising review: \"I never usually write reviews but this is an exception. I've had my AirPods for over a year and when the sound quality was diminishing, I was afraid they had a short life expectancy and I would need to get a new pair! Even after using cotton buds to clean the AirPods out, I thought that was enough until my friend said there's stuff built up and hard to see, but there was nothing able to get it out! Enter this product. It literally took five minutes to clean each ear bud effectively and instantly the sound quality was as good as new! Loud, clear, less trouble connecting to my phone, etc. You don't need a full square to clean them, so you can pull a piece off or reuse a square with a side you haven't used! SO happy I found a solution!\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get 24 squares from Amazon for $15.99 (available in two pack sizes). 5. A veggie chopper for keeping your counter tidy while speeding up your prep time. If you love to cook but hate chopping (who doesn\u2019t, right?), this thing is a lifesaver. It chops just about everything \u2014 onions, peppers, zucchinis, potatoes, you name it! Plus, it comes with different blades for slicing, dicing, and even spiraling your favorite veggies. www.amazon.com , Amazon Check out a TikTok of the veggie chopper in action. Promising review: \"If you cook, you need this product! I have had this chopper since 2018 and it is by far my favorite kitchen purchase. I have used it hundreds of times over the years and it has held up great. I just bought my MIL one for Christmas and she already loves how much easier it has made meal prep . It is well made and I like that there are different attachments and sizes. I would recommend this chopper!\" \u2014 Steph Get it from Amazon for $23.99+ (available in five colors and five sets). 6. A pack of two antimicrobial \"flossing toothbrushes\" because your current one looks like it was used to scrub the bathroom floor (no offense). This has dual-layered bristles: regular ones and ultra-long, thin flossing bristles that get *deep* in between your teeth and gums. Reviewers are saying it feels like they got their teeth cleaned at the dentist, but nope! \u2014 just this very innovative toothbrush. Emma Lord / BuzzFeed Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, specializing in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed for deeper cleans. Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord has to say: \"I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.\" Promising review: \"I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth \u2014 it definitely gets between the teeth and also, more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck, and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!\" \u2014 Jason A. Get a pair from Amazon for $9.99 . 7.

I spray on shovels to keep dirt or snow from sticking, spray around windows and thresholds to deter bugs, clean Sharpies off wood and walls, and, of course, stop squeaky doors. These small direct-point application pens are great. Keep one in the glove box, my kitchen 'junk' drawer, and the house toolbox.\" \u2014 BBP623 Get a three-pack from Amazon for $12.99 . 8.

Promising review: \"Perfect! Exactly what I needed to organize my mop, broom, scoop, etc. Efficient and easy to use. A little hard to get my scoop into it, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s thicker than the rest of the items. Love that there are hooks. Spray bottles and cleaning product bottles hang perfectly on there too.\" \u2014 Kavita Chandanie Get it from Amazon for $13.99 (available in two sizes and two colors). 9.

I absolutely hate taking the shower curtains off because of the whole open and close for several shower curtains. I know you\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s just shower curtain hooks.\u2019 And it is. But when you have to change out the creepy shower liner that likes to attack you, and you dread doing so, this just adds seconds to your life. No more unsnapping. Simply take out the liner, place the liner on the appropriate hook, and presto.\" \u2014 Nardsbaby Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in 18 colors). 10.

I have tried muscle relaxers, stretching, and many other things, but a couple of muscles in my upper back would just knot up with any stress, physical or emotional, and the pain was nearly constant. I used this for about a half hour on all of my muscles with the first use, and the effects were immediate and profound. Pain relief was instant , and occasional use for a couple of minutes to the affected areas has been able to maintain that relief. I loved it so much that I bought one for my brother, who says it is helping him tremendously, as well. I have charged my massager twice in the last two months, battery life is excellent!\" \u2014 Patty S. Get it from Amazon for $89.99 (available in seven colors). 11. A Squatty Potty that elevates your feet to help mimic a natural squatting position for easier, more complete bowel movements. Just because it helps your trips to the bathroom be quicker doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still enjoy some quality TikTok scrolling time while you\u2019re in there! Amazon, www.amazon.com I have one and it has truly made that aspect of life (\ud83d\udebd) soooo much easier!

It's basically like skincare for your driveway! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"The scene: me with a hot glove carrying a drip pan full of au jus. Thumb goes into hot liquid. Pan is dropped, and greasy meat juice is all over our patio brick. In freezing temps. I use a putty knife to get some out, but there the stain remains six months later. Even muriatic acid didn\u2019t cut it. Ordered this. Tried a spot. Let it dry overnight. Swept it. Stain is almost gone. I apply it to the rest of the stain and let it set. But this time it rains and turns it gooey. Fortunately, new power washer and I join forces with Chomp, and within a half hour, it\u2019s totally gone. Amazing product. 1,000% satisfied. \" \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (available in two sizes). 17.

A dishwasher magnet so everyone in the house knows NOT to put their dirty spoon in with the freshly cleaned silverware. Sometimes it's too hard to tell whether the dishwasher needs to be run or unloaded, and this just clears up all the confusion. Sally Elshorafa / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"What took them so long?? Every household should have one of these. Does your partner point to the dishwasher and ask you, 'Hey, are these good?' Mine did, almost daily. Not anymore, though! A breeze to install (our dishwasher is magnetic, but I'm really glad it came with adhesive pads \u2014 someday when we move, if we need them we have them!), and even though I bought it (mostly) as a joke, I use the heck out of it. Slides easily when it needs to.\" \u2014 Andrea Braun Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in six styles). 19. A bestselling ChomChom pet hair remover if you want to see what your clothes, furniture, and other fabric surfaces look like *not* covered in fur.

Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed See the ChomChom roller in action on TikTok ! BuzzFeed Shopping editor Jenae Sitzes swears by this: \"The tens of thousands of 5-star Amazon reviews are reason enough to add the ChomChom to your cart immediately \u2014 but let me add my own personal review to the stack. I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, and I took the photos above to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller \u2014 at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair. It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside , which does require you to apply a bit of pressure. Afterward, you'll just dump out the hair that's been trapped inside. The ChomChom is best for large flat surfaces like couches and beds.\" Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in three colors). 20. And a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator \u2014 I know you're busy, but you simply cannot sit any longer in a house that smells like cat urine.

We have a Rottweiler pup and a bichon pup, and our house was feeling the PAIN! I tried everything and used to tell my wife, 'With all the science and technology in the world, we still can\u2019t come up with something that gets rid of the dog mark smell!' This product does everything and more. Just ordered another round. We were about to throw away some furniture due to the smell and now after use we can keep it. Saved me hundreds. Well worth the money. \" \u2014 clayton s tonkin Get it from Amazon for $17.96 (available in two sizes and packs of two or three). 21. A standing weeder that uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. It has a bamboo handle and four steel claws to really dig into those roots and pull them OUT. Your back deserves a break from playing tug of war with stubborn weeds. Amazon Grampa's Gardenware Co. is an Oregon-based, family-owned small business. Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 22.

Amazon Promising review: \"Saw on TikTok (don\u2019t judge) and automatically added to cart. So easy to use, takes probably a minute to fully bubble up and clean, and you\u2019re left with a clean sink!

And while you're at it, some dishwasher tablets that break down lime and mineral buildup to properly clean your dishwasher (you know, the machine that cleans your dishes ) without *any* effort on your part. Just pop in a tablet and run the dishwasher as normal \u2014 it sure beats having to climb in there yourself and scrub. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and dishes just not getting clean. Then, I became aware that the water softener was no longer doing its job so I had the rental company replace it. Dishwasher performance improved somewhat. I decided to do two more loads before deciding to purchase a new one. Then I saw a product test review for Affresh. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway so I added that to my order. When it came, I tossed one of the tablets into the bottom of the full machine per the instructions and ran the regular cycle. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I will use this faithfully every month, as recommended. \" \u2014 Sheila Get a pack of six tablets from Amazon for $7.49 . 24.

Been using them since high school! The amount of junk and buildup that comes off is so satisfying to see! It can be irritating when removing, especially if you have sensitive skin.

I tried this product on a whim\u2026and boy am I glad!! I wash, rinse and dry in the morning and they are dry and ready for use by lunch if I need a touch up. It does take a few minutes but SO WORTH it!! They more I use it, the faster I am getting. My brushes look new after and feel so much better on my skin. My makeup even goes on nicer.

Say goodbye to digging through messy piles. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Love these acrylic shelf dividers! They make my closet look so neat and organized. I used them to divide shelves that hold my folded workout tops.

There are also ties on the inside to keep your duvet in place. I absolutely LOVE everything about this cover. Can\u2019t wait to get home in my bed after a long, exhausting work shift on my feet.

Amazon Promising review: \"My bra straps spent more time off my shoulders than on them. I have bras that fit perfectly, but the straps are too wide-set or something. I'm so glad I bought these little bra strap clip holders because they've solved the problem. I've used them for three days now, and my straps have not fallen off of my shoulders even once in that time. Amazing! I love them! I put a clip holder on my bra and then put the bra on like a T-shirt \u2014 over my head, put my arms in, then fasten it as usual in the back \u2014 pretty easy. The length of the clip holders are adjustable. I have fully extended them to fit across the back of my 38DD bras.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

EPCOT The HOKA Bondi 8s are undeniably comfy \u2014 we\u2019re talking marshmallow soles, maximum cushion, all the foot-hugging support you could want. But the truth is that we don\u2019t always wear them in Disney World\u2026 and yeah, we\u2019ve got our reasons. DISCLOSURE: This post may contain affiliate links, which means when you click a link and make a purchase, we receive a commission. First, let\u2019s give credit where it\u2019s due: HOKA Bondi 8s are built for comfort. If you\u2019ve ever worn them, you know that soft landing and pillowy feel underfoot. \u00a9Amazon It\u2019s like walking on memory foam. They\u2019ve got great arch support, a wider base for stability, and that oversized midsole is a lifesaver on long walking days. We totally get why so many people swear by them. In fact, most of our AllEars team lives in their HOKAs when they\u2019re in the parks. Grab them here But here\u2019s the painfully honest truth: they\u2019re chunky. Like, really chunky. And while that\u2019s part of the design (and part of what makes them so comfortable), we can\u2019t help but feel a little\u2026 clunky in them. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker, but when you\u2019re already sweating through your tank top and trying to get a cute castle photo? Yeah, it matters. \u00a9Amazon We own the Bondi 8s and do wear them \u2014 just not all the time. Especially not when we\u2019re trying to put together a cuter park look. We know, we know, style shouldn\u2019t come before comfort when it comes to Disney shoes, but sometimes we reach for other shoes instead. They\u2019re sleeker, they pair better with our outfits, and even if they don\u2019t treat our feet quite as nicely by hour eight\u2026 we do it anyway. We suffer a little for the \u2018fit. And we\u2019re not proud of it, but we\u2019re being honest here. So let\u2019s weigh the pros and cons: HOKA Bondi 8 Pros: Extreme comfort and support \u2014 seriously, A+ Great for people who need extra cushioning or have foot pain Durable and reliable even after long days in the parks Fit for actual running (or chasing Lightning Lanes) HOKA Bondi 8 Cons: Bulky, heavy look that doesn\u2019t always go with every outfit Can feel a little stiff at first and take up a lot of space in your suitcase Expensive \u2014 if you\u2019re only wearing them for Disney, they\u2019re an investment Let\u2019s talk about the alternative sneakers we\u2019re reaching for: First, we\u2019ve got these New Balance Men\u2019s/Women\u2019s Oxford Sneakers : \u00a9Amazon They\u2019re still cushy but way more streamlined. Plus, they have a fun retro vibe that works with most of my park outfits. Grab them here Next up, we\u2019ve got these Brooks Women\u2019s Adrenaline GTS 23 Supportive Running Shoes : \u00a9Amazon These are solid running shoes with real support. They\u2019re not quite as chunky as the HOKAS but still have that plush, reliable feel. If you want all-day comfort in a slightly more streamlined silhouette, this is a great option. Grab them here Lastly, we\u2019ve got these adidas Women\u2019s Cloudfoam Pure Sportswear Sneakers : \u00a9Amazon If your Disney style leans sporty-chic, these are a great pick. The foam is soft, the fit is flexible, and the design is cute enough to blend with pretty much any park outfit. Grab them here At the end of the day, wear what works for you. If you\u2019re prioritizing function over fashion, HOKAs are probably your best bet. And if you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019s fully committed to comfort (you should be!), don\u2019t let the look stop you. \u00a9Amazon But if you\u2019re like us \u2014 balancing comfort with aesthetics, especially when you\u2019ve planned a whole Disney look \u2014 we totally get reaching for a sleeker sneaker even if you know your feet will hate you by dinnertime. And yes, we know this is a hot take. But someone had to say it. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for the best Disney essentials, so make sure you stay tuned to AllEars for more!

I write about lifestyle tech Follow Author Apr 12, 2025, 12:45pm EDT Share Save Comment Updated April 12 with more details of offers and deals. Amazon has new price cuts for iPhones which take select models right back to their Spring Sale lows. The discounts apply to the the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, and the iPhone 16 Pro versions, too. In fact, all the phones in the iPhone 16 series are represented apart from the newest of all, the iPhone 16e, which is the most affordable of the range. What\u2019s more, there are bargains to be had if you\u2019d like the iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Plus, as well. Apple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus prices are down at Amazon. Getty Images Amazon U.K. has discounted the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max by \u00a3100 or more. The deals highlighted in this post were independently selected by the Contributor and do not contain affiliate links. Forbes Apple Intelligence For iPhone To Add Google Gemini In Weeks, Report Claims By David Phelan Let\u2019s start with the iPhone 16. The entry-level model has 128GB storage and comes in four colors, of which three are discounted in this storage level. Choose between pink, teal and white to find the iPhone with 13% off. That takes the price down by \u00a3101, from \u00a3799 ($1,019) to \u00a3698 ($890). Here\u2019s the link for the iPhone 16. MORE FOR YOU Microsoft\u2019s Free Upgrade Offer For 500 Million Windows Users \u2018Worse Than 1971\u2019\u2014U.S. Dollar Price \u2018Collapse\u2019 Predicted To Ignite $22 Trillion Bitcoin Challenge To Gold Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Saturday, April 12th If you\u2019re mad about the Ultramarine color, and I couldn\u2019t blame you, there are savings available if you choose the 512GB version. The regular price for this is \u00a31,099 ($1,402) but it has a 9% discount, which also works out at \u00a3101 off, making it \u00a3998 ($1,273). The same price applies for the pink, teal and white finishes. The fifth color, black, is not worth having at the current Amazon price of \u00a31,202.79 for the 128GB storage model. The iPhone 16 with 256GB storage is also not available. Fancy a bigger screen? The iPhone 16 Plus is discounted by 11%, taking its regular \u00a3899 ($1,147) sticker down by \u00a3101 (spotting a pattern here?) to \u00a3798 ($1,018). You only get to choose the white finish at this price, please note. Here\u2019s the iPhone 16 Plus link . There\u2019s more choice for the 256GB storage option, a 10% discount of \u00a3101 brings the \u00a3999 ($1,275) price down to \u00a3898 ($1,146). All colors except black available. The full range of colors is discounted on the largest storage of 512GB. Down from \u00a31,199 ($1,530) by 8% or, you guessed it, \u00a3101, the new price is \u00a31,098 ($1,401) and you can choose between black, pink, teal, ultramarine and white. If you can\u2019t resist the three cameras and titanium frame of the iPhone 16 Pro, these are discounted, too. Here\u2019s the link. All four colors are available for the 128GB storage models. That means Desert Titanium, Black Titanium, Natural Titanium and White Titanium are all 10% off, that means the regular \u00a3999 ($1,308) price is knocked down by \u00a3100 ($131) to \u00a3899 ($1,178). And you\u2019ll notice the magic spell of \u00a3101 off has been broken on this model, though only just. Forbes Apple\u2019s Stealthy New Music Upgrade For Windows PCs Beats Microsoft By David Phelan Same for the 256GB model, which also sees \u00a3100 ($131) off, across the board. Here it\u2019s a 9% discount, taking the \u00a31,099 ($1,439) sticker down to \u00a3999 ($1,308). All four colors available. Step up to 512GB storage and something eerily predictable happens: all four colors available with \u00a3100 ($131) off. This means an 8% price cut, so the regular \u00a31,299 ($1,701) price drops to \u00a31,199 ($1,570). The same \u00a3100 ($131) cut means the regular \u00a31,499 ($1,963) price for the 1TB storage option is \u00a31,399 ($1,832). The biggest phone of all is the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a 6.9-inch display. Check this link and you\u2019ll see a wholly unsurprising discount in place. That\u2019s right, there\u2019s \u00a3100 ($131) off the 256GB model \u2014 the lowest-capacity storage option for the Max \u2014 which reduces the price from \u00a31,199 ($1,570) to \u00a31,099 ($1,439), with all colors ready to ship. The 512GB version also (can you believe it?) shows a \u00a3100 ($131) price cut. That\u2019s a 7% discount and brings the regular \u00a31,399 ($1,832) sticker to \u00a31,299 ($1,701. All colors available. The 1TB option, regularly \u00a31,599 ($2,094) down by \u00a3100 ($131), as you may have guessed. This 6% price cut means you\u2019ll pay \u00a31,499 ($1,963). Lastly, there\u2019s the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. Last year\u2019s standard iPhones may not have all the love expended on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, which arguably took the regular phones closer to the Pro models than before, but they\u2019re still worth considering, especially when the prices are reduced as here. Apple will sell you the iPhone 15 with 128GB storage for \u00a3699. On Amazon ( here\u2019s the link ), all five colors are available for \u00a3598. That\u2019s 14% off and our old friend the $101 discount reappears. The five colors, by the way, are yellow, green, pink, blue and black. Trade up to 256GB and instead of the regular \u00a3799 price you can find all five for \u00a3698. The larger-display iPhone 15 Plus, usually selling for \u00a3799 with 128GB storage, has dropped to \u00a3698, that\u2019s 13% off but only in green and pink. The 256GB storage has dropped from \u00a3899 to, yes, that\u2019s right, \u00a3798, which is an 11% discount. You can choose between blue and black for this deal. The 512GB storage option is available for this larger phone, wih the same \u00a3101 discount, taking the price from \u00a31,099 to \u00a3998. Choose between black and, no, that\u2019s it, just black. Incidentally, if U.S. readers see the price translations and feel the Brits are paying well over the odds compared to prices in the States, remember that U.S. prices are quoted pre-tax and U.K. ones have all sales taxes included, so the disparity isn\u2019t as steep as it looks. And if price rises cut in Stateside because of tariffs, then iPhones could even be cheaper on the other side of the pond one day.

The adhesion is as strong as it was on day one, and this product continues to meet and exceed expectations. I have noticed significantly less eye strain. If I were needing computer monitor backlighting again, I wouldn't hesitate to repurchase. \" \u2014 college_engineer Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in two sizes). 7. A cooling memory foam seat cushion that's unassuming enough to blend in with most any desk chair and will make you feel ~supported~ even on your longest days. www.amazon.com The velour cover zips off for easy cleaning in the washing machine.

It definitely stands out, and the older ladies at my work love it! It works well as a seat cushion, as my office chair is so thin I can feel the metal and plastic bits when sitting. With the cushion, it's super soft and comfortable!\" \u2014 Jane Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in two sizes and six colors). 9. An electric mug warmer because nothing ruins your cozy desk vibes quite like reaching for your coffee only to find it's gone cold. With this chic little warmer, you can join the slow sippers club without having to make a bazillion trips to the microwave. If this seems like one big fire hazard to you \u2014 fear not \u2014 there's a built-in auto shutoff! Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Reviewers suggest turning the heat down from high to medium once the drink gets down to about the halfway point so it stays a comfortable temperature! Check it out on TikTok (where one reviewer even has the genius idea to use it as a candle warmer at their desk, too)! BuzzFeed editor Jenae Sitzes wishes she had bought it sooner: \"After seeing this coffee warmer all over BuzzFeed Shopping and even gifting my dad one for Christmas, I finally decided to buy one for myself. Based on all the reviews, I was pretty confident I'd soon be kicking myself for not getting it sooner, and that proved to be true: This thing not only looks good but works great for keeping my coffee warm all day long. (Because yes, I'm one of those people who'll sip on coffee until 5 p.m., all right!!) I was kind of worried it'd be too small for some of my larger mugs, but the center plate is bigger than expected and accommodated every mug in my (very eclectic) collection perfectly. I can confirm that flat-bottomed mugs are the best option for this warmer as they do stay hotter, but it still keeps my concave-bottom mugs warm enough for my taste. Also, I looove how sleek the white version looks on my white desk, and the auto-shutoff function is a nice safety feature for an absent-minded person.\" Get it from Amazon for $21.99+ (available in nine styles). 10. A slim desktop whiteboard if your desk is littered with distracting sticky notes that always seem to get lost anyway.

Promising review: \"Never thought something analog would be SO useful in my daily routine. I work from home and am constantly project managing a number of complex strategic projects. Having pertinent information directly in front of me and top of mind has done incredible things for my productivity . Never would have imagined it would make such a difference. For a nominal investment, I highly recommend it if you have trouble keeping up with things.\" \u2014 Captainflapjax Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in four styles). 11. Or a wall-mounted acrylic dry-erase board for a major aesthetic upgrade to standard dry erase boards with all the same schedule-tracking, note-taking, and organizing prowess. 1801 & Co. / Etsy 1801 & Co. is a Minnesota-based Etsy shop established in 2016 that specializes in family wall calendars, chore charts, wedding signs, and more. Promising review : \"I love it! I got it so fast after ordering, and it\u2019s perfect . I love the sleek design for my small home office space. I can\u2019t function at work without a dry erase board but couldn\u2019t find any that would look nice in my office space, which is in the corner of my master bedroom! Having functional office space without LOOKING like an office in the bedroom is challenging, but this acrylic board is PERFECT. The black pen that comes with it is very nice fine tip and erases without a trace.\" \u2014 Dawn Powell Get it from 1801 & Co. on Etsy for $32.73+ (available in 19 sizes and three hardware styles/finishes). 12.

Makes my basic office cubicle desk a little prettier and does the job I really needed it for \u2014 to soften the surface of my desk because I hate the way my mouse sounds without a mousepad. Several coworkers have complimented the design and asked for the link! \" \u2014 AliB_Art Get it from Amazon for $18.99 (available in 24 colors/prints). 13. Super pretty rainbow prism sun catchers so you can bask in sunny rainbows even if you're stuck inside working. Who can't help but smile at a rainbow?! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I put two of these in my home office window, where the sun shines in the morning. Every morning, it's an explosion of cheerful rainbows and sunshine, and it just makes me happy to be alive! The quality is excellent. Even though they aren't crystal, I honestly don't think you would ever see a difference if they were, other than being a few hundred dollars poorer. They are heavy, remarkably clear, smooth, crisp facets, and appear flawless.\" \u2014 Dr Hall Get a set of two from Amazon for $9.98 . 14. A capybara desk companion that'll just about force a smile out of you whenever it catches your eye, even when Jake from IT is getting on your last nerve.

I got the light bamboo.\" \u2014 Stephanie Get it from Amazon for $48 (available in four other styles). 17.
