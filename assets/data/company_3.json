It\u2019s affordable, deeply customizable, and very analog. It has manual windows and it doesn\u2019t come with a main infotainment screen. Heck, it isn\u2019t even painted. It can also transform from a two-seater pickup to a five-seater SUV. The three-year-old startup revealed its vehicle during an event Thursday night in Long Beach, California, and promised the first trucks would be available to customers for under $20,000 with the federal EV tax credit by the end of 2026. The event comes just a few weeks since TechCrunch revealed details of Slate Auto\u2019s plans to enter the U.S. EV market, build its trucks in Indiana, and that the enterprise is financially backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The auto industry \u201chas been so focused on autonomy and technology in the vehicle, it\u2019s driven prices to a place that most Americans simply can\u2019t afford,\u201d chief commercial officer Jeremy Snyder said during the event, which Inside EVs livestreamed. \u201cBut we\u2019re here to change that.\u201d \u201cWe are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never been delivered,\u201d CEO Chris Barman added. Image Credits: Slate Auto The Specs Slate isn\u2019t saying exactly how much its truck will cost \u2014 multiple sources have told TechCrunch over the last few weeks the company has gone back and forth on the number. And so much can change between now and a late 2026 release date. The company is saying it will start under $20,000 after the federal tax credit (providing that still exists next year). Interested buyers can place a $50 refundable reservation on the company\u2019s website. The base version of Slate\u2019s truck will squeeze 150 miles out of a 52.7kWh battery pack, which will power a single 150kW motor on the rear axle. For folks who get a little spooked at that number, Slate is offering a larger battery pack that it says will have about 240 miles of range. It will charge using a North American Charging Standard port, the standard Tesla established that almost all major automakers now use. The truck comes with 17-inch wheels and a five-foot bed, and has a projected 1,400-pound payload capacity with a 1,000-pound towing capacity. Since it\u2019s an EV, there\u2019s no engine up front. In its place there\u2019s a front trunk (or frunk) with 7 cubic feet of storage space, which happens to have a drain in case the owner wants to fill it with ice for that tailgate party. That towing capacity is lower than a more capable Ford F-150, and is even less than the smaller Ford Maverick, which can tow around 1,500 pounds. Speaking of the Ford Maverick, Slate\u2019s truck is smaller. The Slate EV has a wheelbase of 108.9 inches, and an overall length of 174.6 inches. The Maverick has a 121.1-inch wheelbase and overall length of 199.7 inches. Everything else about the base version of the truck is awfully spare \u2014 and that\u2019s the point. Slate is really maximizing the idea of a base model, and setting customers up for paying to customize the EV to their liking. Custom\u2026 everything Screenshot Image Credits: Slate Auto Slate is deeply committed to the idea of customization, which sets it apart from any other EV startup (or traditional automaker). The company said Thursday it will launch with more than 100 different accessories that buyers can use to personalize the truck to their liking. If that\u2019s overwhelming, Slate has curated a number of different \u201cstarter packs\u201d that interested buyers can choose from. The truck doesn\u2019t even come painted. Slate is instead playing up the idea of wrapping its vehicles, something executives said they will sell in kits. Buyers can either have Slate do that work for them, or put the wraps on themselves. This not only adds to the idea of a buyer being able to personalize their vehicle, but it also cuts out a huge cost center for the company. It means Slate won\u2019t need a paint shop at its factory, allowing it to spend less to get to market, while also avoiding one of the most heavily regulated parts of vehicle manufacturing. Slate is telling customers that they can name the car whatever they want, offering the ability to purchase an embossed wrap for the tailgate. Otherwise, the truck is just referred to as the \u201cBlank Slate.\u201d As TechCrunch previously reported, the customization piece is central to how the company hopes to make up margin on what is otherwise a relatively dirt-cheap vehicle. But it\u2019s also part of the friendly pitch Slate is making to customers. Barman said Thursday that people can \u201cmake the Blank Slate yours at the time of purchase, or as your needs and finances change over time.\u201d It\u2019s billing the add-ons as \u201ceasy DIY\u201d that \u201cnon-gearheads\u201d can tackle, and says it will launch a suite of how-to resources under the billing of Slate University. \u201cBuy your accessories, get them delivered fast, and install them yourself with the easy how-to videos in Slate U, our content hub,\u201d the website reads. \u201cDon\u2019t want to go the DIY route? A Slate authorized partner can come and do it for you.\u201d The early library of customizations on Slate\u2019s website range from functional to cosmetic. Buyers can add infotainment screens, speakers, roof racks, light covers, and much more. The most significant are the options that let buyers \u201ctransform\u201d the truck into roomier SUV form factors. But these aren\u2019t permanent decisions. Slate says people will be able to change their vehicle into, and back from, an SUV if they like \u2014 \u201cno mechanics certification required.\u201d All that said, Slate\u2019s truck comes standard with some federally mandated safety features such as automatic emergency braking, airbags, and a backup camera. Buckle up The road to making a successful American automotive startup is littered with failures. In the last few years, Canoo, Fisker, and Lordstown Motors have all filed for bankruptcy. And that\u2019s just to name a few. Those companies that are still around, like Rivian and Lucid Motors, are hemorrhaging money in an attempt to get high-volume, more affordable models to market. Slate is a total inversion of that approach. It\u2019s going after a low-cost EV first and foremost, and hopes to make that business viable by supplementing it with money from this deep customization play. But, much like Rivian and Lucid Motors, it also has deep-pocketed backers. It has raised more than $111 million so far (the exact figure is still not public). And, aside from Bezos, has taken money from Mark Walter, Guggenheim Partners CEO and controlling owner of the LA Dodgers, as TechCrunch reported this month. The company has hired nearly 400 employees in service of accomplishing all of its ambitious goals, and is currently trying to hire more. Slate arguably could not have picked a more volatile time to make its debut, but it\u2019s also focused on domestic manufacturing, and may be insulated from some of the turmoil facing other startups and established automakers. \u201cWe believe vehicles should be affordable and desirable,\u201d Barman said Thursday, adding that Slate\u2019s truck \u201cis a vehicle people are actually going to love and be proud to own.\u201d Topics electric vehicles , EVs , jeff bezos , slate auto , Startups , Transportation Sean O'Kane Sr. Reporter, Transportation Sean O\u2019Kane is a reporter who has spent a decade covering the rapidly-evolving business and technology of the transportation industry, including Tesla and the many startups chasing Elon Musk.

Four days ago I responded to a friend and commenter who wished me well on my health, but many readers missed it, no doubt, my reply being only in the comment section. So I'm paraphrasing it here for all. I wrote: \" Full disclosure is warranted. I've been slammed by a paralyzing depression, not the first in my life. But a medicine review is imminent. I'll be back on my feet once I regain my wits.\" Thus my absence. I'm now being treated for this lovely gift from nature: major depression, accompanied by all the usual, and really ugly, symptoms. If you have ever had this condition youself, you are well aware of how arduous it is to pull oneself out of it, or I should say, for medications to overcome it. A few years ago I read novelist William Styron's observations about depression \u2014 his own \u2014 titled \"Darkness Visible: A Memior of Madness.\" This microcosmic volume is both universal in scope \u2014 centering, as it does, on an all too commom illness among us humans \u2014 and perfectly titled. One sees the darkness. The aothor's brilliantly insightful work is synopsized (I have, of course, misplaced my copy) as \" Styron's true account of his experience of crippling depression. Styron is perhaps the first writer to convey the full terror of depression's psychic landscape, as well as the illuminating path to recovery.\" Crippling \u2014 spot on. I provide this disclosure only as an update on where I'm at \u2014 as a reader of, and perhaps a contributor to, this site, you deserve it \u2014 and in hopes of your understanding.

Pretty much, when it comes to protein bars anyway. Essentially a candy bars with protein. Even then I still will probably jump on this, I'm a fan of the mint, and PB flavors. 2 3 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link sumosha 2d ago Apr 24, 2025 11:45 PM 114 Posts Joined Apr 2014 2d ago Apr 24, 2025 11:45 PM sumosha 2d ago Apr 24, 2025 11:45 PM 114 Posts Quote from Slickfriendly : Natural ingredients with 0 added sugars or sweeteners is the best.

Electrical & Electronics Bose Headphones Unknown Related Stores Amazon AU Marketplace Comments jamesorion on 25/04/2025 - 14:53 +2 I bought a pair for my partner around 8 months ago. She uses them probably around 5 hrs a week, and already the stitching on both ear cups have come apart. Looking online, this seems to be a common issue. bakery on 25/04/2025 - 14:58 +4 yep its happened to me as well and i used it for over a year, the replacements are around $40 if you want BOSE ones but there are cheaper ones on aliexpress worker on 25/04/2025 - 17:40 It sucks that happens, get the Bose ones the ones on AliExpress are terrible and flake a lot quicker jamesorion on 25/04/2025 - 17:57 I plan on getting them replaced for free, given that they are not even a year old. Definitely won't be buying Bose headphones again. 4slime on 25/04/2025 - 18:10 +1 Seems to be a common occurence with headphones nowadays. Even my more premium headphones have the earpads fall apart every couple of years despite taking care of them. giventofly on 25/04/2025 - 18:46 Wow, that's really poor My Audio Technica M50x did that. Replacement pads already doing it again after barely a year. My 1st gen Sony MDR-1000x are faded, but still going strong. They look flaked, but nothing ever peeled - they just cracked after 8 years. FarKen on 25/04/2025 - 18:46 Not sure if helpful but still rocking the QC 35 ii Got a set of Wicked Cushions replacement pads from ebay in June 2021 which are still going strong. https://amzn.asia/d/4eF5PXz I'd buy them again. conza on 25/04/2025 - 20:10 +2 Just on the earcups, I've had the original QC35s, now the NC700s, I've found both of these get 2-3 years from a set of cups, worn every day for 12 hours approximately. I haven't got this headphone, yet, but it does seem like a significant upgrade on the NC700s, what I suggest is, use the case that comes with them, if you place the headphones down on rougher surfaces, that will wear them. The replacements are very cheap, from my experience, and non-OEM models are fine, they're all over Amazon looks for this model's yeah a set by Tersely for example, I think I have them now on my NC700s, they're probably 2 years old and seem brand new still, but I look after them. YMMV. FujinShu on 25/04/2025 - 23:40 This, Airpods Max USB-C, or Beats Studio Pro? cosmicle on 26/04/2025 - 08:23 Airpods Max aren't even in the same league.

But the search for alternatives hasn\u2019t stopped", "content": "Why the search for third-party cookie alternatives hasn't stopped Life Beyond the Cookie Privacy fatigue is setting in after Google\u2019s cookie U-turn. But the search for alternatives hasn\u2019t stopped By Seb Joseph \u2022 April 25, 2025 \u2022 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Ivy Liu For years, privacy was treated as advertising\u2019s great reckoning. The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation in 2018, Apple\u2019s crackdown on mobile identifiers and the slow death march of third-party cookies in the largest browser \u2014 it all painted a picture of a future where platforms would be reined in, marketers would be forced to adapt and users would finally gain some measure of control over their data. That future never quite arrived. What followed instead was a slower, stranger drift: enforcement grew spotty. Regulatory efforts stalled and the largest platforms \u2014 Google, Meta, Amazon \u2014 emerged with even more concentrated power than before. Fines dried up. Reforms got diluted or delayed. And cookie deprecation, once symbolic of the new era, came full circle when Google confirmed it wouldn\u2019t eliminate third-party cookies from Chrome after all. Rather than leveling the playing field, the privacy era has mostly reconfigured it \u2014 redrawing the boundaries in ways that preserve, and in some cases expand, the dominance of those who were supposed to be disrupted. To some, that wasn\u2019t a twist. It was the natural outcome of a system where platforms, not regulators, have long dictated the terms of engagement around privacy. The past month only confirmed this dynamic: Apple\u2019s privacy rules were fined by French regulators, Google stepped back from deprecating third-party cookies. It seems as if advertising\u2019s much-vaunted pivot to privacy slammed into a wall \u2014 and bounced off. \u201cEver since Cambridge Analytica, the privacy movement has been moving forward full steam ahead with the ad industry developing different types of PETs, clean rooms and ID solutions,\u201d Shiv Gupta, U of Digital\u2019s founder, said on the ad tech education firm\u2019s podcast earlier this week. \u201cBut for the first time it seems as if the industry\u2019s privacy crusade is starting to lose some of that momentum.\u201d Well to a point, at least. Europe\u2019s regulatory momentum may be flagging \u2014 thanks to stalled efforts to push through reforms to the ePrivacy directive and a quiet softening of the GDPR\u2019s more complex provisions \u2014 but it hasn\u2019t vanished. And in the U.S., enforcement remains inconsistent but it still packs a punch \u2014 just ask American Honda Motor Co. Meanwhile, the industry itself hasn\u2019t hit pause. Chrome\u2019s decision to stick with third-party cookies might have taken the urgency down a notch, but the broader shift away from those cookies hasn\u2019t stopped. In fact, much of the ecosystem has already moved on. Safari and Firefox made cookies obsolete years ago, and mobile, the heart of modern media consumption, was never built around them to begin with. Put another way: Third-party cookies are still widespread but they\u2019re no longer foundational. The shift is already underway, it\u2019s just no longer waiting on Chrome. \u201cA major advertiser reached out to us today [April 23] to tell us that they still want to be testing cookie-less solutions,\u201d said Matt Sattel, chief revenue officer at OpenX. Why? Because they want to measure the performance gap between impressions bought with third-party cookies and those bought without. Whatever Chrome\u2019s stance, this marketer wants alternatives that scale. Third-party cookies may still be available, but they remain a liability \u2014 technically, legally and reputationally. That\u2019s why the search for alternatives never really stopped. As Sattel explained: \u201cThe fact that this came from a senior marketer when it did shows that privacy is still top of mind for a lot of buyers in spite of what is or isn\u2019t happening to third-party cookies.\u201d For marketers like this, the lesson\u2019s clear: Whatever they\u2019re building to target or measure ads needs to be built to last. It has to withstand platform shakeups, legal curveballs and everything in between. That means treating identity not as a single bullet but as a portfolio \u2014 one that blends authenticated IDs, probabilistic tools, contextual signals, cohort-based strategies and tight data partnerships with publishers. Because when one piece falters, the rest need to hold. \u201cWe now had a major auto client in the U.S. replace deterministic [data] sets with fully contextually indexed sets for the rest of this year, and they put meaningful spend through the product,\u201d Audigent CEO Drew Stein said on a panel at Ad Week Europe earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s not just good from an ecosystem perspective. It\u2019s great from a performance perspective.\u201d Performance, after all, is where much of this experimentation pays off. According to OpenX, Safari display inventory is on average 70% more economical than traditional addressable channels, and video is 45% more so. Moreover, solutions that unlock previously unaddressable environments aren\u2019t just privacy-compliant; they can offer cost savings for marketers and fresh monetization for publishers. Case in point: OpenX and ID5\u2019s partnership has helped increase Safari desktop reach by 58% and mobile traffic by 37% compared to cookie-only strategies. \u201cThe promise of this privacy shift was supposed to be user empowerment and platform accountability,\u201d said Ravi Patel, CEO and co-founder of media platform SWYM.ai \u201cInstead, we\u2019ve ended up with an ecosystem where the largest players can rewrite the rules whenever it suits them \u2014 and everyone else is left scrambling to adjust. It\u2019s a reminder that real change won\u2019t come from platforms self-regulating. It\u2019ll have to come from the buy side demanding better.\u201d That moment may still feel distant, but it\u2019s no longer out of sight. Small shifts are happening. Marketers are asking harder questions. Scrutiny is building. And the sense that privacy must be owned, not outsourced, is finally starting to take hold.

Taco seasoned cream cheese is topped with seasoned ground beef and 5 layers (or more!) of your favorite taco toppings! Simply serve with tortilla chips and watch it disappear! This is one of the easiest of all the dips to pull together. Seven layers of taco goodness, piled on top of each other and enjoyed with crispy tortilla chips. I could make meal out of this easily . My dear friend Heidi first introduced me to this taco dip years ago, in fact I adapted my recipe from hers. In my dip, the base is taco seasoned whipped cream cheese topped with taco meat, finely shredded lettuce, cheddar jack cheese and a plethora of our favorite taco toppings (even some that are optional!). In all reality, there most likely isn\u2019t a wrong way to layer this taco dip, but of course, I have a favorite. If you find your self looking for an appetizer to serve or bring to your next get-together, let this be it. It\u2019s so simple to throw together and once it\u2019s finished all you need to do is grab a bag of your favorite tortilla chips and dip, eat and repeat. To Make This 7-Layer Taco Dip You Will Need: lean ground beef \u2013 I like to use 90/10 for this recipe. taco seasoning \u2013 Use homemade or store-bought. See notes on taco seasoning below. whipped cream cheese \u2013 Can use regular but allow to soften a bit at room temperature. cherry tomatoes \u2013 Can substitue with grape or seeded and diced roma tomatoes. cheddar jack cheese \u2013 Or use a cheese you prefer. iceberg or romaine lettuce \u2013 Very thinly shredded/sliced. avocado \u2013 Lends richness and creaminess to the dip. green onions \u2013 Adds a mild yet bright onion flavor. tortilla chips \u2013 Used for serving. Optional Add-Ons: black olives red onion jalapeno cilantro diced bell peppers A Note About Taco Seasoning: If using my homemade taco seasoning you\u2019ll want to double the recipe but DO NOT double the salt, otherwise this dish will be way too salty. You can make the beef mixture saucy by adding a little cornstarch 1 to 2 teaspoons to your homemade taco seasoning. Then, once your meat mixture is cooked though and seasoned, pour in 1/2 cup of water and stir until thickened \u2013 increasing the heat if needed. If using store-bought, I highly recommend Siete brand as you would only need 1 packet (if you\u2019re using another brand, you may need 2). There\u2019s no need to add cornstarch if using store-bought seasoning, simply follow the package directions. Make The Seasoned Ground Beef: To a 10-inch skillet, add 1 pound of lean ground beef. Use a spatula to break it up into small crumbles, cook until no longer pink. Drain and discard any accumulating fat from the pan. Add in 4 tablespoons taco seasoning. Stirring well until combined. Make The Cream Cheese Layer: In a small bowl add 8 ounces of whipped cream cheese and 3 tablespoons taco seasoning. Use a rubber spatula to scrape the edges of the bowl and stir until combined. Build The Taco Dip: Spread cream cheese mixture into the bottom of your serving dish, then top with the cooked ground beef in an even layer. Next, top with 1 generous cup of finely shredded iceberg lettuce, 1 generous cup of shredded cheddar jack cheese, 1 cup cherry tomato halves and 1/4 cup sliced black olives. Lastly, top with 1/2 of a finely diced avocado, 1 to 2 thinly sliced jalape\u00f1os, 2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion, 2 to 3 green onions that have been sliced and 2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro. That\u2019s it. So simple. And so very, very delicious! I recommend making this right before serving. However if making it in advance, prep the cream cheese layer, seasoned ground beef and individual toppings with the exception of the avocado the day before and store separately. Then build the dip before serving. Enjoy! And if you give this 7-Layer Taco Dip recipe a try, let me know! Snap a photo and tag me on twitter or instagram !

Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine the cream cheese with the remaining 3 tablespoons taco seasoning and set off to the side. Spread the cream cheese mixture on the bottom of a serving platter/dish. Top with the cooled ground beef mixture. Then top with the remaining ingredients in this order - this is the way I like my dip.

Even made with frozen fruit and minimal liquid it\u2019s just a few minutes between soft serve consistency and soupy fruit. discuss this deal Chill Out Simply put: these are bowls lined with gel that can freeze. Clear enough? Great! Now, a big part of the marketing for these things hinges on their use as vessels for ice cream. And, obviously, there\u2019s good reason for that. You want to enjoy a bowl of delicious ice cream on a hot day without having to risk brain freeze before the sun reduces it to cr\u00e8me anglaise? These can help! But there\u2019s so much more you can do with them. Like, let\u2019s say you\u2019re having people over for a little patio party. You want to set out some snacks, right? Maybe a nice creamy spinach dip or some French onion dip. Delicious! As long as they don\u2019t boil in the summer heat. Same goes for veggies to dip in those dips. There\u2019s just something weird about munching on lukewarm carrots. Or, what if you\u2019ve got gazpacho soup on offer? Even if you keep it inside, where it won\u2019t get too hot, it\u2019s still risky. After all, your guests will expect it to be chilled, so even if it only gets up to room temperature, it can burn someone\u2019s mouth, because they won\u2019t be expecting it. Our point is: you can think of dozens of uses for these things. And yet, most of these would not be considered everyday uses. You\u2019re not having several patio parties a week. And while there are some stretches where you get a good tub of ice cream and want to enjoy some every evening after dinner, eventually you\u2019ll run out and decide not to buy more for a little while for your tummy\u2019s sake. Which is what makes them the perfect Meh product. Because you look over at Amazon, and you see that each one runs about 15 bucks, and you think, Sure, I probably would use them occasionally, but not enough to justify spending that much. Whereas, at $20 for 4, the math is less complicated. Even if you and your family use these things five times between when they\u2019re delivered and the last truly warm day in September, that\u2019s money well spent! (Not to mention, there\u2019s always next year.) So get some freezable bowls for a great price, whether you use them a lot or a little. 4-Pack: HOST 18oz Ice Cream Freeze Bowls 26 comments, 40 replies @mediocrebot shared a deal on a 4-pack of HOST 18oz Ice Cream Freeze Bowls available at meh.com.

No comments 1 minute read Up next Published on 24 April 2025 Author Michael Kozlowski Tags Amazon , amazon kindle , amazon kindle software , kindle 15.18.2 , kindle firmware , kindle software update Amazon has just released the 5.18.2 software update for most modern Kindle e-readers. The main change is in the users\u2019 library, where all their e-books are housed. Authors are sorted by default by an author\u2019s first and last name, making it more intuitive to find an author quickly. Previously, by default, it sorted by the author\u2019s last name and first name. The Amazon Kindle Scribe 2024 model also received some love today with Customizable Notebook Summaries: You can now customize the length and tone of summaries in notebooks. You can also save your customization options for quick access. Various Kindle models received new features in the previous software update issued in March (15.18.1). Double Tap for page-turn uses the device\u2019s accelerometer, which allows users to tap on the side or back of the device to turn a page. The other flagship feature was Kindle Recaps. You can access short recaps for thousands of best-selling English language Kindle books in series you have purchased or borrowed. Refresh your memory on what happened in a previously read book before starting a new book in a series. Bugs inevitably occur with any new feature, and also, on the 5.18.2 update, Amazon Kindle has received performance improvements, bug fixes, and other general enhancements. The 15.18.2 update was issued for the 12th and 11th generation Kindle e-readers. Visit the Kindle Software page to read the full patch notes.

Mike Nolan on 25/04/2025 - 17:11 Tbh I\u2019m not sure how good the price is, but I have this exact model (shield 2TB) and can very highly recommend. Exceptional build quality (I\u2019ve not experienced any looseness of the USB-C port) and super fast transfer speeds. m13 on 25/04/2025 - 23:38 I too have this exact model. Purchased it about 1.5 years ago from OW for $188 and also zero issues to date. I like that it works connected direct to my phone as a previous portable drive I tried did not. It also spent 12 months in a drawer of a caravan travelling around Australia and no signs of loose USB-C port at all.

These heather shirts (mix of cotton and polyester) are more durable than just 100% cotton ones and more breathable too. I still have the same heather Covington T-shirt from Sears that I still have that are like 6-7 years old while the 100% cotton shirts are all rags now. 2 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link htp182 Pro Deal Hunter Yesterday Apr 25, 2025 3:48 AM 4,277 Posts Joined Jan 2012 Yesterday Apr 25, 2025 3:48 AM htp182 Pro Deal Hunter Yesterday Apr 25, 2025 3:48 AM 4,277 Posts Amazon [ amazon.com ] has Carhartt Men's Loose Fit Heavyweight Short-Sleeve Pocket T-Shirt (Sizes XS-XL, Oiled Walnut Heather) for $9.99 .

This is also our first indoor camera to support 2.4GHz and 5GHz via WiFi-6 for faster speeds and lower latency.

Affiliate relationships have no impact on editorial ratings and reviews. The Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders have gone live at midnight through most major retailers . As expected, there have been issues reported by those hopeful to get their hands on Nintendo\u2019s upcoming console . With everyone trying to get their pre-orders in, many websites are getting hit with huge amounts of traffic all at once. Some retailers have handled this better than others while some have crashed and burned. Regardless of whether players pre-order through Best Buy, Walmart, Target, or GameStop, demand is high, as seen by Japan pre-orders exceeding expectations . However, the demand has caused the console to sell out almost instantly. Videos by ComicBook.com As pre-orders have gone live, Target has been hit hard and the strain on the website has caused it to crash and disrupt the sales process. This is preventing many from being able to get their pre-orders in and potentially missing out on the Nintendo Switch 2 or the Mario Kart World Nintendo Switch 2 bundle at launch. However, many have had luck using the Target app rather than the website though it appears Target\u2019s stock sold out almost instantly. Best Buy has recognized the high demand for the Nintendo Switch 2 and required an account for pre-orders. Despite logging in, many could not add the Nintendo Switch 2 console or bundle to their cart and check out. This was due to the pre-order start being delayed. After nearly 30 minutes, the pre-order went live and players could join the queue. Some have reported sticking through the lengthy queue and being able to complete the purchase, while others were greeted with a message the Nintendo Switch 2 was sold out. Walmart placed potential buyers into a queue and it seems this is the route to go, as many are reporting getting in. Once in, they have been able to pre-order the Nintendo Switch 2 or the Mario Kart World console bundle. Those pre-ordering through Walmart should stay in the queue, wait for their turn, and they will be able to complete their purchase. mario kart world on nintendo switch 2. RELATED: Nintendo Switch 2 Leak Shows New Hands-On Look at the Console To say the Nintendo Switch 2 hype is high would be an understatement. Nintendo fans have been eager to pre-order the console since the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct aired and revealed the release date. Retailers have been preparing for this event, such as Best Buy\u2019s planned midnight release or GameStop revealing how many consoles will be at some stores and a midnight release . Amazon is notably absent from the Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order list and fans have wondered why. Those who have been able to navigate this pre-order nightmare can look forward to their console arriving on or near launch day. If you missed out on getting a pre-order in, there is the option of going to a store on launch day as soon as they open. Getting there early will probably help, as some dedicated gamers will be waiting in line before the doors open. Those who miss out on these pre-orders can still get a pre-order email from Nintendo later on in May .

More Switch 2 details We knew from the teaser trailer for the Switch 2 that Nintendo's new hardware would be bigger and would have a new approach to the detachable Joy-Cons. The new Joy-Con 2 have a new C button, mouse controls and a built in gyroscope for tilt control. The console has a built-in mic to support a new feature called Game Chat that will let you communicate with friends in-game. The device is indeed a bit larger, with a 7.9-inch LCD screen that supports a 120Hz refresh rate, HDR and a 1080p resolution. When docked, you'll be able to play at up to 4K on your TV, and Nintendo says it improved the consoles internal speakers as well. The new dock also has a built-in fan to keep the console cool and help maintain performance during long play sessions. The Switch 2 has dual USB-C ports for charging, and the base storage amount has increased to 256GB. The Switch 2's storage can be expanded like the previous model, but it will only work with newer microSD Express cards. Tariffs and the Nintendo Switch 2 During its most recent Direct presentation at the start of April, Nintendo showed off more of the Switch 2 than it ever had before. That included the reveal of the April 9 pre-order opening date, in addition to the original $450 starting price. Shortly after, President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on China and other countries, prompting Nintendo to delay pre-orders in the US and Canada. In a reversal, President Trump then announced a 90-day pause on steep \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs affecting 75 countries, but also announced that the tariff imposed on China will go up even further (currently, it's up to 245 percent for that country). We now know that the original $450 price for the Switch 2 will remain the same in the US and Canada, but based on its official statement, it appears Nintendo is leaving the door open for potential future price increases. We also know that Nintendo started moving some of its Switch console manufacturing to Vietnam in 2019. The reciprocal tariff for Vietnam was set to be 46 percent, but that appears to be on hold for now in favor of a 10 percent reciprocal tariff that\u2019s now in effect for the 90-day pause period. It has been speculated that Nintendo will boost production of Switch 2 consoles in Vietnam so it can stay on schedule, even if it sells the console at a loss in the short term. It appears the company will have to seriously ramp up production to keep up with Switch 2 demand : according to Nintendo, 2.2 million people entered the pre-order lottery in Japan alone, which is far more devices than it is expected to deliver in that region on launch day.

What began as a simple video-sharing platform by PayPal colleagues has evolved into a dominant force, poised to surpass US cable TV in paid viewership. The platform now hosts diverse content, attracting over 2.5 billion global viewers and boasting 100 million music and premium subscribers. Agencies YouTube on Wednesday celebrated more than 20 billion videos being uploaded to the platform since the first clip debuted two decades ago. The online video-sharing platform has evolved from a dinner party lark into a modern lifestyle staple poised to overtake US cable television in paid viewership. PayPal colleagues Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim conceived YouTube in 2005, reportedly during a dinner party. The domain YouTube.com launched on Valentine's Day that year. Video uploading capabilities were added on April 23, when Karim posted the first video, titled \"Me at the Zoo.\" The 19-second clip showing Karim at the San Diego Zoo's elephant exhibit has garnered 348 million views. Over the next 20 years, the site expanded beyond what was imagined possible back in 2005. Live Events YouTube says that it now sees an average of some 20 million videos uploaded daily. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories The platform hosts everything from concert clips and podcasts to political ads, tutorials and much more. YouTube has become the world's largest digital video service in terms of time spent by viewers and ad revenue, according to eMarketer analyst Ross Benes. The platform reached more than 2.5 billion viewers globally last year, and hit 100 million subscribers to its music and premium tier, according to market tracker Statista. YouTube is projected to surpass all US cable television services in paid subscribers within two years, according to Benes. Users worldwide watch more than a billion hours of YouTube content daily on television sets alone, Google reported. YouTube said it will upgrade its TV viewing experience this summer with improved features and \"quality tweaks,\" though it did not provide further details. \"If you go back 20 years, it would have seemed laughable that this website with kids making parody videos would become a threat to Disney, ABC, and CBS,\" Benes said. \"That's what they were able to accomplish.\" Analysts consider Google's 2006 purchase of YouTube for $1.65 billion in stock a pivotal moment, combining Google's search and advertising expertise with a video-sharing platform that had passionate users. Google used its advertising know-how to build a successful model, sharing revenue with creators who attracted significant audiences. The company enhanced technology and negotiated with studios to address copyright violations on what was once considered the Wild West of video content. YouTube also worked its way past concerns that disturbing content, like parody videos of popular cartoon characters in violent or risque situations, were being served up to children by its recommendation software. The platform now competes with streaming services like Netflix, Disney, and Amazon Prime, as well as short-form video platforms like TikTok and Instagram's Reels. gc/jgc Read More News on youtube YouTube statistics youtube videos youtube tv google Read More News on youtube YouTube statistics youtube videos youtube tv google Prime Exclusives Investment Ideas Stock Report Plus ePaper Wealth Edition A former Musk associate\u2019s mission: End addictions in Kerala with digital currency How Pahalgam attack may knock the wind out of Kashmir air travel The Ambani, Adani, Tata twist to India\u2019s nuclear energy playbook As SIPs dip a tad, cut the noise and focus on long-term growth Stock Radar: Engineers India stock takes support above 200-EMA, ends 14-week consolidation; check target price & stop loss These mid-cap stocks with \u2018strong buy\u2019 & \u2018buy\u2019 recos can rally over 26%, according to analysts 1 2 3 View all Stories Poll of the Day Will Trump 2.0 mean good news for Indian startups?

Facebook X LinkedIn Copy to Clipboard Copy Transport News Fresh airport security scare shines light on Australian aviation\u2019s uncertain future A security scare at Moorabbin Airport this month is another reminder that privatisation without sufficient obligations to the aviation sector is threatening Australia\u2019s flying future. Michael Sainsbury Apr 24, 2025 2 min read Share 0 Moorabbin Airport (Image: Civil Aviation Safety Authority) On Sunday, April 13, a woman was arrested after scaling a fence and running onto active runways at Melbourne\u2019s busy Moorabbin Airport. This prompted the airport to shut down all active runways and direct aircraft to turn off their engines to prevent any risk of injury before the intruder was tackled, arrested and charged, tenants at the airport told Crikey . The incident, which has not been reported until now, highlights growing concerns over the airport\u2019s security, which, despite its level of activity, does not have Australian Federal Police (AFP) or Department of Infrastructure personnel stationed on-site. It came only five weeks after a 17-year-old, armed with a shotgun and knives, breached Avalon Airport\u2019s perimeter by entering through a hole in the fence and boarded a Jetstar flight with around 160 passengers before being subdued. In response, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke ordered immediate risk assessments at all large regional airports and directed upgrades to intrusion detection and monitoring systems.

Calls to the Goodman-owned airport to confirm the incident were rebuffed with a terse and repeated \u201cfor any information, you will need to contact the police\u201d from a receptionist clearly under strict orders. She would not put our call through to any executive or hand over any of their names. A spokesperson for Victorian Police told Crikey that: \u201cPolice have charged a woman following an incident at an airport in Moorabbin on April 13.\u201d She remains in the court system. Decline in aviation services Tenants say the incident is just the latest result of aviation services being run down and sidelined by Goodman, including an encroachment of commercial premises onto land and businesses formerly part of the airport. These include critical flying schools and engineering businesses \u2014 led by engine repair shops \u2014 leaving the airport in the decades since its privatisation \u2014 part of a mass airport privatisation in 1996 under the Howard government. Under Goodman\u2019s stewardship, an increasing amount of the airport has been developed for non-aviation businesses. Rents have risen, aviation businesses have been pushed out, and aviation infrastructure at the airport has been allowed to run down. Moorabbin Airport did not respond to emailed questions. \u201cBefore privatisation, there were 30 engine shops at Moorabbin. Now if I want my engine repaired, I have to send it to Brisbane,\u201d one businessperson who works out of the airport told Crikey.

Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 1198029 \u2018Laughable\u2019: Qantas pilots mock new chairman\u2019s plea to consumers Michael Sainsbury 26 The combination of privatisation (the airport leases are 49 years plus 50 years) without sufficient obligations to the aviation sector, and the lack of any overarching plan for the future of aviation in Australia to address the local and international shortage of pilots and engineers by successive federal governments is threatening Australia\u2019s aviation future. \u201cIt might sound dramatic but if people are wondering in five or 10 years\u2019 time why they can\u2019t get a flight to Bali or their Amazon parcel delivered, or if flying doctor services are having to send engines offshore for repair, then it\u2019s started here, \u201d an aviation tenant at Moorabbin said. It\u2019s not just Moorrabin, but other secondary city airports including Melbourne\u2019s Essendon, Brisbane\u2019s Archerfield, Adelaide\u2019s Parafield, Perth\u2019s Jandakot and Sydney\u2019s Bankstown. These airports were leased or are operated by property developers and logistics companies \u2014 including Goodman, private interests and various superannuation funds \u2014 which are slowly forcing out aviation-related businesses, tenants and former tenants at a number of the airports told Crikey . The operators of Bankstown and Camden Airports \u2014 who run them on behalf of superannuation fund Aware \u2014 have rebranded them as business parks named Aeria . In the 2023-24 financial year, the six metropolitan \u201cClass D\u201d airports handled more than 1.2 million movements, or one-third of all movements through \u201ctowered airports\u201d in Australia. Questionable master plans These airports are required to submit a \u201cmaster plan\u201d every five years to the federal government to ensure they adhere to the terms in their head leases that stipulate they must continue to maintain and operate the airports. Moorabbin\u2019s last master plan in 2021 was initially rejected by then minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development Barnaby Joyce due to the excess encroachment of development onto airport land, and faced serious objections from the local council before a fresh version was finally approved in 2023. The 2023 masterplan for Archerfield, which is owned by interests associated with the Bird family , was also rejected by the generally hands-off federal department before being approved in March 2025. Archerfield is developing over 50 hectares of land for industrial, warehousing, logistics, and commercial purposes as part of the South West Industrial Gateway initiative. Overall, while capital investment has increased, it has generally been on the property side, and there has been a decline in general aviation activity and training capacity, underscoring systemic tensions between profit motives and the sustainability of the Australian aviation sector. Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 1202615 Qantas fares will soar in a Trump market. It\u2019s the airline\u2019s own fault Michael Sainsbury 19 Still, each airport\u2019s owner has their own priorities. Essendon continues to compete with Tullamarine for corporate traffic, and Aeria was keen to point to its continuing investment in aviation, and fact that it\u2019s ability to service aviation and flying schools is being threatened by the new Western Sydney Airport, despite complaints from tenants to Crikey about rising costs making for a bleak future. \u201cAeria Management Group (AMG) has invested more than $100 million in new and enhanced facilities and infrastructure to support general aviation (GA) at Bankstown Airport and Camden Airport. Looking ahead, our $50 million Aviation Hangar Project Major Development Plan will support up to 10 GA operations, including emergency and aeromedical services, while our Aviation Microsites Program will deliver at least eight new hangars of varying sizes, one of which will start construction this year,\u201d a spokesperson for Aeria told Crikey . While the surge of privatisation in the 1990s has damaged a range of sectors across the country \u2014 most pertinently the lack of any obligations on Qantas to keep up its once world-leading engineering apprenticeship scheme \u2014 the lack of any national plan by successful federal governments lies at the heart of aviation\u2019s troubled future. The federal government paid lip service to the importance of the general aviation sector in its 2024 Aviation White Paper last year, and acknowledged shortages of skilled professionals in the sector. \u201cGeneral aviation businesses provide the skills, innovation and expertise that underpins Australian aviation, and are the training ground for our next generation of aviation professionals. The government is committed to growing general aviation into the future,\u201d the white paper said. Yet, as multiple people from within the sector and at the secondary capital city airports have said, none of this has been backed up by any funding or plan. The engineer shortage has hit even the major airlines, and pilot training is being pushed further into the regions \u2014 away from the people it wants to attract. Without action, including better curbs on commercial expansion of some of the major secondary airports, Australia\u2019s aviation future remains uncertain at best.

Baer Will the Common Good Guys Come to the Shootout in SEC v. Jarkesy? And Why It Matters By Eric W. Orts Climate Disclosure Line-Drawing and Securities Regulation By Virginia Harper Ho Board Committee Charters and ESG Accountability By Lisa M. Fairfax \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we be chilled by this?\u201d a federal judge remarked about President Trump\u2019s imposing extraordinary penalties upon the Perkins Coie law firm. The firm represented Trump rival Hillary Clinton in 2016 and is now suing to challenge the president\u2019s executive order. Meanwhile, the firms of Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps have agreed to $40 million and $100 million respectively in pro bono work favorable to Trump causes in a deal for his dropping a similar order against them. In agreeing to the deal, Paul Weiss\u2019s chairman and Skadden\u2019s executive partner indicated they worried clients would be scared away for fear of becoming White House targets. Since then, several other major law firms have followed suit. When retribution from the Oval Office threatens the nation\u2019s legal system, there is cause for worry in C-Suites across America. It is in companies\u2019 self-interest to seek stability, predictability, and the rule of law, to compete and thrive. Dizzying executive orders, stop-and-start tariffs, stock market turbulence and unprecedented assaults such as the law firm orders instead create a climate of reeling uncertainty and risk. Is there a way for business leaders to help protect their companies? We believe that by developing long-term frameworks for deciding whether, when, and how to spend millions of dollars to influence elections, companies can make a consequential difference in reducing the risks they face and demonstrate they are responsible corporate citizens. If companies exert this leadership, they can install guardrails. Ours is a modest proposal; it will not suspend wholesale upheaval from Washington, but it will help companies cushion themselves against manageable harm in today\u2019s dramatically changed political environment. By their nature, companies are risk-averse, but not necessarily in writing checks to affect elections for national, state, and judicial posts across the country. They may say they\u2019re simply seeking a seat at the policy-making table. But political spending is a kind of speech, and it can associate a company with elected officials and policies that conflict with a company\u2019s public commitments or the beliefs of its shareholders, workers and consumers. It can bring political retaliation. It can associate a company with assaults on American democracy. If a company has no, or loose, policies for its political spending, decisions may be made on an ad hoc basis. This is a formula for enterprise risk. A safer and smarter path forward is to follow a corporate code of conduct , a strategic framework for political spending. It can lead companies to know and publicly disclose where their contributions ultimately end up. In making political spending decisions, companies would consider societal interests and democracy that affect the broader business environment as well as getting a seat at the table. Shareholders overwhelmingly support this idea, with 87 percent of retail shareholders surveyed by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy saying they believe corporations should be required to have a code of conduct to assess and govern their political spending. With more and more companies facing consumer boycotts \u2013 think Target, Amazon, and Walmart facing blowback over rolling back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) measures \u2013 it\u2019s not surprising that shareholders are wary. Following a strong code of conduct builds upon a big corporate governance change by leading U.S. companies: In recent years they\u2019ve made disclosure and accountability of their political spending a mainstream norm. Top S&P 500 companies now strive to earn the best scores for transparency and accountability in an annual scorecard from the nonprofit that one of us heads. This disclosure and board oversight must be a central principle in a broader code of corporate conduct. Moreover, taking voluntary action like this is a workable step, not a giant leap. The chemical industry (where one of us worked in Washington), for example, subscribes to a \u201cResponsible Care\u201d initiative for safe handling of products and to involve the public in its decision-making processes. A new governing era demands strategic responses by companies. They want to stay out of the crosshairs of political or cultural conflict. They want stability, predictability and the rule of law in which to compete and prosper. This change isn\u2019t coming from Washington. It\u2019s up to companies to protect themselves from risk. With a long view and a robust framework for donating political dollars, they can navigate the political landscape, endeavor to protect their reputations, meet stakeholder expectations, and uphold their own values and democratic principles too. This post comes to us from Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability , and Peter Molinaro, former vice president for North American Government Affairs at Dow , Inc.

deal Poop Better The time has come, Meh customers. When we finally say those three magical words, the ones that will take our relationship to another level, not just ecommerce store and consumer anymore, but something more intimate. And of course, the words we\u2019re talking about are: \u201cHow\u2019s your rectum?\u201d But seriously, we want to know. How\u2019s it going down there? You feeling good? Fulfilled? When you sit down on the can to do your business, does it seem like you\u2019re ready to clock out afterwards, are does your work come home with you, so to speak? Because there\u2019s nothing worse than that, right? Getting a chance to finally take a seat on your toilet at home and experiencing incomplete results. That\u2019s what this thing is for. According to Tushy, the shape of modern toilets isn\u2019t spectacular for complete bowel evacuation because the sitting position results in a bent rectum. But, luckily, the Ottoman Go \u201copens your rectal canal from 100 to 120 degrees, improving your bowel health and relieving constipation.\u201d (Those degrees are the angle kind, mind you. If a thermometer tells you your rectum is 120 degrees, go immediately to the hospital.) Sounds good, right? But does it actually work? At first, it was hard to tell. Scrolling through the Amazon reviews (of which there are only about 70) we saw a lot of talk about how sturdy this thing is, how simple it is to assemble (you have to screw on the legs, maybe?), how easy to clean it is, and how it\u2019s helpful if you\u2019ve got kiddos who might need help getting up and situated on the John. But not too many people bragged about the massive shits they were taking with a fully uncoiled route from tummy to toilet bowl. Until, that is, we got to this one from user Brett Combs : Before Ottoman Go, I thought my bathroom experiences were okay, but I was living in a fool\u2019s paradise. This Ottoman doesn\u2019t just create a natural pooping position; it\u2019s like a yoga master for your intestines, ensuring a grand opening every morning. Constipation, hemorrhoids, and bloating are now just myths from the ancient times of pre-Ottoman life. Well done, Brett. Well done. Of course, if you use this or a product like it let us know how you it works in the comments. We want to hear about your poop, is what we\u2019re saying. And if that sounds unappealing, maybe just go straight for the buy button.

I cheap out and buy store brand on everything else that I bake with (oil, flour, sugar, etc.) but Ghiardelli chocolate chips are worth the splurge.

But, for now, Switch 2 preorders are out of stock everywhere. If showing \"not available\" at GameStop, hit the button anyway and it may still be added to the cart. Walmart also seems to be restocking in waves throughout the day, but it's region-dependent, so YMMV.

Preorders went about as well as many expected (badly). The Switch 2 is sold out, at least for now. Preorders have come and gone at Walmart, Target, and Best Buy, while GameStop started its online gambit at 11am EST8 am PST, but also now looks to be out of stock. Still, you could also try your luck with an in-store preorder . Bookmark this page for live Switch 2 preorder updates throughout today and until the console's launch on June 5. Follow @IGNDeals on Twitter/X or Bluesky for instant updates. Those who registered with Nintendo to preorder starting from May 8 should still keep an eye on their inbox in the coming days, but the gaming giant has since issued a warning to U.S. customers , stating that release date delivery is \"not guaranteed\" due to \"very high demand.\" We are also seeing reports of Switch 2 orders being canceled at Target , and Walmart also seems to be delaying some order deliveries as far as June 10 (previously promising 9am delivery on release day, June 5 ). Check your emails to see if you've been affected. Scalper listings have also already appeared on eBay that are selling the console way above retail price, at $600 or more. There's also been a strange immersion of counter-plays, supposedly fighting back against resellers by making fake Switch 2 listings at retail price. Similar cases are happening in other regions like the UK , where Switch 2 preorders have also been temporaily wiped out (follow @IGNUKDeals for updates).

In a recent update, the company confirmed that several Switch 2 peripherals will \u201cexperience price adjustments from those announced on April 2 due to changes in market conditions.\u201d Read: Tariffs mean that pretty much everything is a little more expensive now. Expect to pay an extra $5 for the main accessories, including the new Joy-Con 2 controllers, the Switch 2 Pro Controller, and the much-hyped camera add-on. The Dock Set sees the biggest jump, climbing $10 to $119.99. Still, if you\u2019re planning to pick up the full ecosystem at launch, above is the full list of accessories currently up for preorder , price hike or not, alongside every retailer you can preorder from just below as well.

The side-scrolling carousel above has all the new Amiibo in it, but if any of them are sold out when you click to buy or you want more details, check out our full guide on everything available . Which Retailer Should You Preorder the Switch 2 From? PSA: You should also expect demand to be high across the board. Be ready for virtual queues, sluggish sites, and potential checkout hiccups. When restocks eventually happen between now and launch day, or even beyond that, and you do finally get through to purchase, you\u2019ve got two main options: the Nintendo Switch 2 ($449.99) , or the Nintendo Switch 2: Mario Kart World bundle ($499.99) . Which should you buy? If you\u2019re picking up a Switch 2 at launch, the Mario Kart World Bundle is hands down the best value. You\u2019re getting Mario Kart World for just $50 more, instead of the full $79.99 MSRP , saving you $30 versus buying the standalone game. To improve your odds, log in ahead of time, ideally before navigating to the Switch 2 listings, and make sure your shipping and payment info is saved to your account, or keep a backup card nearby just in case. Here\u2019s an additional breakdown of what each retailer is offering for Switch 2 preorders and what to expect when it comes to launch day delivery and in-store pickup. TL;DR: Switch 2 Preorder - Retailer Guide Walmart : Fastest delivery (by 9am on June 5) if ordered before launch day. GameStop : Midnight launch pickups at select stores. In-store preorders start with store hours; online starts at 11am EST, April 24. Target : Online-only preorders opened at 12am EST, April 24. Best Buy : Midnight launch events also planned for June 5 . Online preorders started April 24. Amazon : No listings yet. Nintendo products have been missing lately; it's uncertain whether this will change before launch. Walmart is currently offering one of the most aggressive delivery promises: Consoles ordered right at launch are expected to arrive by 9am on release day, June 5. It\u2019s a rare guarantee, and one that\u2019s likely to drive a quick sellout (albeit the retailer might be walking this back, so we'll update you further when we hear any updates). Moreover, it's currently the cheapest offering at $499, rather than $499.99 everywhere else. Small savings, but well worth considering. GameStop is also leaning into the midnight release hype, with select locations set to offer in-store pickup as soon as the clock strikes 12 on June 5. In-store preorders are open during regular hours from April 24, while online availability doesn\u2019t kick in until 11am EST . Play Target also flipped the switch at midnight, though it\u2019s sticking to online-only preorders for now. As with most major launches, stock is expected to be tight. But, it does already have every game and accessory up for preorder , which is a nice bonus if you're looking to pick up a few extras. They are also a great place to preorder the new Amiibos . Best Buy, meanwhile, has confirmed April 24 as its preorder date and has also commited to a 12am EST start time for preorders. It's also offering a selection of alternative Switch 2 bundles or \"packages\" that might be worth checking out if you're struggling to buy the console and accessories individually. Like GameStop, it\u2019s also planning midnight launch events at some stores, though the full rollout plan is still being finalized. Which Nintendo Switch 2 Game Are You Most Excited For? The Duskbloods Donkey Kong: Bananza Mario Kart World Hollow Knight: Silksong Answer See Results The biggest question mark, however, is Amazon . As of this writing, the retail giant has no official listings for the Switch 2 \u2014 not the console, not its accessories, and only a few select games. This isn\u2019t an isolated case; over the past year, Nintendo products have quietly disappeared from Amazon\u2019s U.S. storefront , including staples like Switch Online memberships and digital game codes. Whether this signals a behind-the-scenes distribution snag or a strategic shift is unclear, but for now, it leaves would-be buyers without one of the most convenient ordering options. Switch 2 FAQs: Delays, Price, Release Date Preorder Date: April 24, 2025 Start Time: 12am EST at major retailers like Walmart Release Date: June 5, 2025 (still on track) Price: $449.99 for the standard model, $499.99 for the Mario Kart World Bundle (limited stock) Accessories: Prices have crept up by about $5 each compared to initial announcements Nintendo: Can't meet demand, preorders likely to sell out It\u2019s been a chaotic few weeks for anyone in the U.S. trying to lock down a Nintendo Switch 2. After the Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct in early April , Nintendo unexpectedly delayed preorders across the U.S. and Canada . Originally set to go live on April 9, the launch was pushed back due to the impact of Trump-era tariffs and what the company called \u201cevolving market conditions.\u201d The UK got a head start on the U.S., and preorders went live on April 8 and 9 with some retailers jumping the gun even earlier on April 2. And now? They're wiped out as well. So if you're hesitating in the U.S., take note: Stock won\u2019t hang around forever. Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery View 91 Images Should you preorder the Switch 2 or wait? Nintendo is already saying it will currently struggle to meet worldwide demand, stating : \"We received an extremely large number of applications [at My Nintendo Store], approximately 2.2 million people in Japan alone. \"However, this number far exceeds our expectations, and far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered from the My Nintendo Store on June 5th. Therefore, unfortunately, we expect that a significant number of customers will not be selected when the winners are announced tomorrow, April 24th.\" What We Said in Our Switch 2 Preview Play Here's what Logan Plant had to say in IGN's Nintendo Switch 2 preview : \"Switch 2 is a more premium product and the price tag reflects that. It\u2019s also a better version of a great thing, and it\u2019s trying to pull off a bunch of cool new tricks at the same time, like mouse controls. \"Obviously we\u2019re both buying Switch 2 on day one, and I did really love our hands-on time with the console. But I\u2019ll be honest and say I have some concerns about if the general public is willing to adopt a $450 Nintendo console with an $80 Mario Kart. \"It\u2019s a big ask for a company that traditionally targets families and younger players, and I feel like the high cost of entry limits the Switch 2\u2019s potential to take off in the way its predecessor did. \"But for those of you that do decide to take the plunge, you\u2019ll be getting what\u2019s shaping up to be a great hybrid console that makes a ton of worthwhile improvements on the original Switch and adds some fun bells and whistles for good measure.\" How to Increase Your Chance of Getting a Switch 2 When a major piece of gaming hardware goes up for preorder at a retailer, there\u2019s no telling how long it will be available. We\u2019ve seen sought-after hardware sell out in seconds . With demand expected to be high, here are some key tips from the IGN commerce team to improve your chances of getting a Switch 2 at launch. Follow IGN Deals on X and Bluesky Log in to retailer accounts: Walmart , Amazon , etc. Have a credit card saved in your account Subscribe to our IGN Deals Email Newsletter Opt into push notifications Play While it may leave it up to chance, and we're recommending folk to buy from major retailers ASAP to avoid disappointment, Nintendo is also still offering a registration system through My Nintendo Store . Invites to purchase will be sent out on a first-come, first-served basis.

Where did the lead report come from? There was a 2023 report of high lead and cadmium levels in dark chocolates, not just Lindt. The levels were within safe levels, so it wasn't causing any lead poisoning, but it was higher than the years before. Milk chocolates were not reported with high levels, so this deal is not effected.

Across the globe, there is now speculation circulating about who will replace Pope Francis, who has died aged 88 .

The events of Conclave , which stars Ralph Fiennes, is set to take place in real life , with a replacement usually selected about a fortnight after the Pope\u2019s death. Conclave follows the sequestering of cardinals, ministers and other religious figures at the Vatican as they elect their new leader after the death of a fictional pope. Recommended How accurate is Conclave? What the Oscar-winning film gets right about search for new Pope Whoopi Goldberg, Martin Scorsese and Eva Longoria lead heartfelt celebrity tributes to Pope Francis Conclave viewership soars after Pope\u2019s death The film unpacks the political machinations that occur behind the scenes as the religious leaders battle their faith, conscience, and their duty to the Church and the legacy of their most recent leader.

Only those under the age of 80 are eligible to vote in the conclave. The number of cardinal electors \u2013 those who partake in the secret vote \u2013 is limited to 120. Starring alongside Fiennes in the film are Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini.

It's ~4 years old, but still holds its ground. Cheapest 4k, I reckon, at least in this brightness class. https://www.rtings.com/projector/reviews/viewsonic/px701-4k 6.8/10 on Rtings The ViewSonic PX701-4K is a 4k HDR projector primarily marketed for gaming. It has two HDMI 2.0 ports, both capable of either 4k @ 60Hz or 1080p @ 240Hz. The projector also comes with an Ultra-Fast Input option promising input lag as low as 4.2ms. The projector has auto vertical keystone technology to eliminate trapezoid effects when installed at an angle and an advanced projection warping tool that corrects distorted images when they're projected on a curved surface. Depending on the selected picture mode, its light source is rated for anywhere from 6,000 to 20,000 hours. Finally, it has an integrated 10W speaker. The ViewSonic PX701-4K is alright for watching movies. Its native contrast is great, and its brightness is decent, leading to a good viewing experience in a dark room. Unfortunately, the projector drops the ball when it comes to color, as its colors are dim, its color gamut isn't very wide, and its color accuracy is wildly inaccurate out of the box. You can barely improve it with calibration. Price History at CamelCamelCamel .

Not one that is 4 years old. huuuuugo on 23/04/2025 - 14:42 Another one from ViewSonic in the same price class, but low stock: https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/887383?page=12#comment-164\u2026 mrXO on 23/04/2025 - 14:53 +2 Have this for a number of years now. Replaced Benq PE7700 (?) at the time. PQ is not bad. HmrW on 23/04/2025 - 15:55 I wonder if the PQ will be different between traditional 4k projector and the ultra short throw one. I was interested in projector but the thought of having to set up the distance between the pj and screen kinda put me off. The ust projector seems to be a bit simpler to set up but again im not an expert just want to hear others opinion on this jackwilk on 23/04/2025 - 16:12 it's been around this price for a while now Kaomichael on 23/04/2025 - 16:24 +1 Nice price for what it is. I have this projector, it is alright. But it will struggle with dark scenes. The other disadvantage is that it used traditional halogen lamp which can get really hot and has limited life. There are some entry level laser projectors that might be of better value, even though they may cost more. Buyingcrap on 23/04/2025 - 18:58 I'm getting really pissed off with projectors, in the last 15 years I have had 4 and they all died. 3 Benq's and a Sony. 2 new, 2 second hand. I'm now using a Nebula capsule that was only ever meant to be for camping on my screen setup, it's only 100 ansi lumens and 720p but it kinda works for now. Once you get into the movie you don't really think about the specs. I'm honestly thinking about a $200 china special that puts out 500 lumens and 1080p, I mean that's a big step up from the Nebula but nothing like my previous projectors. Getting hard to justify another $1000 to $2000 for an occasional movie when these things are consistently shitting the bed on me. tunzafun001 on 23/04/2025 - 21:30 I have a Chinesium LED projector from 2012. Paid $250 ish for it. Still works perfectly. Android Ice Cream Sandwich is well beyond it's time, but have no complaints with it\u2026 desync on 24/04/2025 - 10:30 that's because you either don't use it or have incredibly low viewing standards OpayuOnam on 24/04/2025 - 07:38 What light source was each? DMD or LCD? Have you tried LED/Laser from known Chinese brands like Xgimi or Xiaomi or Formovie? I have some projectors reaching 5+ years from these brands in the cycle of friends and no complaints. desync on 24/04/2025 - 10:32 cooling is the issue, if you don't maintain them they will die as the cool system degrades, the more dusty the environment the sooner they will fail some of the benqs had a blower style fan buried deep in the guts, those would clog up and cook the internals Hellcat on 23/04/2025 - 20:00 Comment on riting \"the projector drops the ball when it comes to color, as its colors are dim, its color gamut isn't very wide, and its color accuracy is wildly inaccurate out of the box. You can barely improve it with calibration.\" No thanks. Nom on 23/04/2025 - 22:27 This is an ultra budget model - you can grab a laser model with spectacular colour like the BenQ but it's three times the price.

However, incorrectly parking in one area of a different Ontario city appears to come with a secret third consequence that some drivers claim is worse than the standard fine one might reasonably expect, along with being potentially dangerous and litigation-worthy. Ottawa Street Dental, located in downtown Windsor, has come under fire this month due to management's brash attempts to take local parking issues into their own hands. Following what one can only assume were multiple instances of random cars occupying private parking spaces reserved for patients, staff at the clinic began affixing large \"illegal parking\" stickers onto offending vehicles, which appear to be virtually impossible to remove, along with being problematically (and unlawfully) placed. One viral video shared to Instagram shows a driver's futile attempts to remove one of the stickers, which someone at the business adhered to their driver's side window, partially blocking their line of sight. \"We accidentally parked in Ottawa Street Dental's parking lot yesterday, thinking the unmarked spots along the alley [were] the cafe parking next door,\" the poster explained in the caption on the clip , which now has more than 210,000 views. While they admitted this was a \"silly mistake\" on their behalf, they shared the video to question the office's tactics, which they posit \"could be considered mischief or something like that, especially if the stickers are hard to remove and aren't part of any official or lawful enforcement.\" \"By the looks of it, similar looking stickers found on Amazon are labeled 'impossible to be ripped off in one piece,' are designed to come apart in teeny tiny chunks and are 'difficult to completely remove,'\" they continued, adding that the dentist's was also closed on the day they had inadvertently parked in one of the private spaces. \"While I sincerely apologize for the mix up of accidentally parking in your lot and I'm sure mistakes like mine are extremely frustrating for you \u2014 next time, just tow my f***ing car or something,\" the driver went on to beg the business, tagging its Instagram account directly. It does not appear that Ottawa Street Dental's account ever replied to the post, which was made two weeks ago now. Owners also declined to comment when blogTO reached out to them over phone and email. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Made in YQG - Showcasing Windsor Ontario and Surrounding Region (@madeinyqg) While a few of the hundreds of commenters on the post chastised the motorist for parking on private property, many chimed in with criticisms of the clinic instead, with the opinion that the measure is complete overkill. One person told whoever came up with the idea to \"grow up,\" while others agreed the strategy is \"immature\" and \"petty,\" especially since the establishment was closed on the day in question. \"It would be a shame if someone purchased a pack of these stickers off Amazon and put them all over their storefront. What a joke lol,\" another wrote. Still others offered tips for removing the stubborn label, questioning, like the poster, if the DIY decals could be considered legal. Multiple people noted that the same thing had happened to them or someone they know. Local police did tell blogTO that while they \"understand the frustration business owners face when vehicles are parked illegally on private property,\" they \"urge property owners and businesses to use appropriate and lawful methods when addressing these situations.\" \"If a vehicle is parked illegally on your private lot, the recommended course of action is to contact a licensed towing company to have the vehicle removed. This is the most effective and lawful way to manage unauthorized parking,\" a representative of the Windsor Police Service said to blogTO over email. They added that making sure there is clear signage indicating parking in the area is reserved for customers, and that all other vehicles may be towed, is a preferable and proactive step to prevent the issue in the first place \u2014 and one that will likely receive far less hate than Ottawa Street Dental's chosen course of action.

Indeed, the pace of negotiations was brisk, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, with 18 different countries offering proposals so far and Trump\u2019s trade negotiating team set to meet with 34 countries this week to discuss tariffs. Trump himself expressed optimism that a trade deal with China could \u201csubstantially\u201d cut tariffs, lifting markets. After setting a baseline import tax of 10% and much higher on dozens of countries earlier this month, Trump abruptly put the steeper levies on hold for 90 days for countries to try to negotiate less stringent rates. The talks blitz is occurring after hundreds of finance and trade delegates arrived for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank Group, almost all with the singular mission of inking a deal to ease the hefty tariffs burden Trump has imposed on U.S. goods imports since beginning his second stint in the White House in January. With tariffs on goods coming into the world\u2019s No. 1 economy now at their highest in a century, the IMF projects global growth in 2025 will slow to 2.8%\u2014its poorest showing since the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014from 3.3% in 2024. And it is not just a pain being visited upon others: U.S. gross domestic product growth will drop by a full percentage point to just 1.8% in 2025 from 2.8% last year, the IMF forecast, with \u201cnotable\u201d upward revisions to inflation as the cost of imports climbs. Another big victim of the fallout is China, with the IMF slashing its growth outlook to 4.0% for this year and next under the weight of crushing import taxes of 145% now levied against imports to the U.S. from the world\u2019s largest goods producer. China has retaliated with 125% tariffs of its own on goods from the U.S. , effectively resulting in a trade embargo between the largest two economies, a standstill that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said neither sees as sustainable. According to a person who heard Bessent\u2019s closed-door presentation on Tuesday to investors at a JP Morgan conference in Washington, Bessent believes there will be a de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions but described future negotiations with Beijing as a \u201cslog\u201d that has not started yet. TRUMP ON CHINA L ater on Tuesday, Trump expressed optimism that he would make progress with China that would substantially lower tariffs on their imports but also warned that \u201cif they don\u2019t make a deal, we\u2019ll set the deal.\u201d Trump said a deal would result in \u201csubstantially\u201d lower tariffs on Chinese goods. \u201c It won\u2019t be that high,\u201d Trump said when asked about the current rates. \u201cIt won\u2019t be anywhere near that.\u201d He added that \u201cit won\u2019t be zero.\u201d U.S. stocks jumped in extended trade following Trump\u2019s comments, with Amazon and Nvidia gaining 3% each and Apple rising 2%. .N While talks have been slow to start with China, Bessent and other members of Trump\u2019s trade team have been pressing on with other key trading partners, though details are scant and no firm deals have been reached so far. The U.S. and Japan, for one, are moving closer to an interim arrangement on trade, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, but many of the biggest issues are being put off. Such an interim framework will not tackle the thorniest issues facing the two countries in their trade relationship, and it was still possible that no final deal could be reached, the person said on condition of anonymity. That movement comes after the U.S. and India said during a visit there by Vice President JD Vance that they had agreed to the broad scope of negotiations. While the two sides touted it as significant progress, agreeing to the so-called \u201cTerms of Reference\u201d mostly provides a roadmap for more extensive talks ahead. Meanwhile, a number of U.S. companies reporting first-quarter results said tariffs are having an effect on business. Consumer giant Kimberly-Clark said tariffs would cost it about $300 million this year, with CEO Michael Hsu noting \u201cthe breadth and degree of tariffs and also the countries involved have changed significantly since maybe where we were at the end of the last quarter.\u201d GE Aerospace CEO Larry Culp told Reuters he recently met with Trump and urged him to restore a tariff-free regime for the aerospace industry that existed under a 1979 agreement. Culp said the company\u2019s position was \u201cunderstood\u201d by the administration, but added \u201cit\u2019s not the only item they\u2019re solving for.\u201d GE Aerospace hung onto its outlook for the year, despite the cost of tariffs. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to press this point respectfully in the hopes that we can re-establish in effect what we had prior to the recent tariff moves,\u201d he said in the interview. The affirmation of its outlook helped lift GE Aerospace shares by more than 5%. Indeed, investors rattled over the past two months by Trump\u2019s harsh tariffs and erratic approach to imposing them seemed to find some solace among the earnings being reported. The S&P 500, on the heels of another steep down day on Monday, rose about 2.5% on Tuesday. Copyright 2025 Reuters. Click for restrictions . Topics Trends Was this article valuable? Yes No Thank you!

More from the series \u2192 When the economy wobbles, most marketers ease off the gas. Amazon is telling them to floor it \u2014 on its ads, naturally. It\u2019s a predictable pitch from a media owner. But Amazon isn\u2019t just any seller of ad space. It can draw a straight line from impression to impact \u2014 be it a sale or a sentiment shift. That\u2019s compelling in any climate but especially when every marketing dollar has to prove its worth. \u201cThe depth of Amazon\u2019s customer data and its massive scale and reach are substantial advantages in this environment,\u201d said Sky Canaves, principal analyst, retail and e-commerce at eMarketer. Amazon execs have been reiterating that message in recent meetings with marketers, armed with fresh data from Ipsos\u2019 March Consumer Tracker, according to an April 2025 pitch deck shared with Digiday. According to the survey, consumer confidence in their financial wellbeing has dipped to 37% \u2014 right where it was in 2022, when inflation and recession fears were peaking. Marketers then faced the same fork in the road they\u2019re at now: pull back on brand-building and invest in short-term performance plays like discounts. Many did, and in hindsight, many lost. There\u2019s now plenty of data showing that staying the course through the chaos paid off. Amazon\u2019s betting that marketers remember the lesson. But just in case they don\u2019t, its execs are more than happy to jog their memory. The pitch deck lays it out plainly: brands that cut upper and mid-funnel ad spend in 2022 saw customer growth drop 5% year over year, whereas those that increased it grew by 14%. The contrast is ever sharper when it comes to those brands that went completely dark on upper and mid-funnel advertising \u2014 they saw sales slump 9% while those that stayed the course saw growth surge 10%. It might sound counterintuitive for a company built on performance dollars to push brand-building. But in Amazon\u2019s playbook, it\u2019s perfectly on message. The idea that ads don\u2019t just convert \u2014 they compound \u2014 has been a central part of its pitch since it launched ads on its streaming service over a year ago. No surprise then, that Amazon\u2019s putting serious muscle behind touting the value of streaming TV. When the stakes are high and the purse strings are tight, it\u2019s not just about clicks for marketers \u2014 it\u2019s about staying relevant. When trying to acquire new customers during a period of uncertainty, the deck states that brands that didn\u2019t use upper funnel video ads only saw 6% year-over-year new-to-brand customer growth in 2022, compared to the 17% year-over-year increase seen by those that did use upper funnel video ads. Amazon emphasized the message by using automotive brands that had invested in Fire TV. In 2022, auto brands that only combined display and fire tablet relative to those that only used display ads saw 1.3 times higher click-through rates. But even better were those brands that combined display, fire and video ads, as they saw 12 times higher click-through rates. Amazon is trying to emphasize that brand and performance shouldn\u2019t be treated as rival strategies, but complementary forces. When calibrated correctly, they don\u2019t compete, but compound. Brands that invested in both ads and retail promotions saw 1.3 times higher lift in purchase compared to those that relied only on retail promos, according to the deck. Amazon\u2019s clarity \u2014 and its ability to tie it all back to results \u2014 may be its sharpest tool as it angles to grab a bigger slice of the full-funnel pie. These examples are likely even more relevant now given the global tariff situation , which will likely pave the way for sales and ad spend to shift between markets, while Amazon remains a steady destination . And that\u2019s because ad buyers on Amazon are roughly split 50:50 between Chinese and non-Chinese sellers. \u201cOther direct-from-China platforms will be impacted more than Amazon from the dual impact of tariffs and the end of the de minimis exemption,\u201d said Claire Holubowskyj, senior research analyst at Enders Analysis. \u201cThis advantages Amazon by leveling out the other platforms\u2019 price advantage, and shifting the momentum back towards Amazon\u2019s USPs of fast delivery and enormously sticky Prime membership.\u201d And unsurprisingly, Amazon\u2019s DSP \u2014 which is overseen by the same team driving this pitch \u2014 is key to those efforts. \u201cAmazon\u2019s investments in expanding and streamlining its DSP have been paying off and it\u2019s poised to capture more interest from advertisers looking to run targeted campaigns across channels,\u201d Canaves said. Still, the key factor isn\u2019t so much that Amazon can sell ads through their DSP, but rather that they have designed their platform to make advertising a necessary cost of doing business, added Holubowskyj. \u201cThe commodified nature of goods on the platform make advertising essential for visibility: pulling back on spend due to broader uncertainty simply isn\u2019t an option for sellers that want to continue selling on Amazon,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd selling elsewhere is a difficult proposition as most sellers have optimised for the platform and lack brand recognition.\u201d To view the full pitch deck, click below: Amazon didn\u2019t immediately return Digiday\u2019s request for comment.

No need for any specialty ingredients, just simple pantry and fridge ingredients whipped up into fluffy pancakes with crispy buttery edges. This recipe yields 18 medium size pancakes or 6 (3 pancake) servings. The word basic gets thrown around a lot these days as if it\u2019s a bad thing. I like basic. I\u2019m not a Starbucks fan but I do love a basic cup of coffee with cream, a messy bun, leggings and Ugg boots, or if it\u2019s summertime, Birkenstocks. I like what I like and I won\u2019t me made to feel bad about it. So when I say \u201cYour Basic Weekend Pancakes\u201d I mean a simple, classic pancake recipe that should be your go-to for simple yet delicious pancakes. A recipe that calls for typical pantry and fridge ingredients so you don\u2019t have to make a special trip to the store for ingredients like buttermilk or ricotta \u2013 although I do have pancake recipes that call for those ingredients as well. One thing my weekend pancakes must have are crispy edges. And the key to achieving those is to use butter. Butter makes everything better, no? Butter in the batter and also on the griddle. It\u2019s really that easy. So when you wake up on a Saturday or Sunday morning (or any other day for that matter) and immediately crave pancakes, this is your recipe. To Make Your Basic Weekend Pancakes You Will Need: unbleached all-purpose flour \u2013 Provides structure to the pancakes. granulated sugar (white) \u2013 Adds a touch of sweetness and flavor. baking powder \u2013 Is what makes pancakes light and fluffy. fine salt \u2013 Use sea or pink himalayan salt to balance and enhance flavor. whole milk \u2013 Lends flavor and aids in yielding a tender pancake. eggs \u2013 Lends richness and flavor. pure vanilla extract \u2013 Adds warmth and enhances all of the flavors in this recipe. butter (melted) \u2013 Lends richness, flavor and is important for crispy edged pancakes. In a large mixing bowl (or liquid measuring cup), measure and add in 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 4 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon fine salt. Whisk to combine and set off to the side. Next, measure 2 cups whole milk into a 4-cup liquid measuring cup or bowl. Add in 2 large eggs and 1-1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract. Whisk well to incorporate. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Use a rubber spatula to stir until. combined. If. your batter has some lumps, that\u2019s totally okay. Lastly, pour in 1/4 cup of melted (and cooled slightly) butter. Once combined, allow the batter to rest for 10 minutes or so. Preheat your griddle 350\u2109 (or 180\u2103) or a frying pan on medium to medium-high (may need to adjust heat as you cook) and grease with butter. You will need to butter your griddle before each batch to ensure your pancakes have crispy edges. Measuring out 1/4 cup of the pancake batter and pouring it onto a preheated and buttered griddle or skillet. Cook the pancakes until the air bubbles pop and no longer fill back in with batter and the bottoms are golden brown and edges are crisp. Flip and cook for another minutes or so. HOW TO KEEP PANCAKES WARM WHILE MAKING: Preheat your oven to the lowest setting or 200\u00b0. After the first batch, transfer the pancakes onto a rimmed cookie sheet. Keep the pancakes warm in your preheated oven while making the remainder of the pancakes. Spread each pancake with a little butter and drizzle with pure maple syrup. Pancake perfection! WHAT TO SERVE WITH PANCAKES? Because pancakes tend to be on the sweet side, I recommend a savory side as well as some fresh fruit. breakfast potatoes cauliflower hash brown patties (low carb) bacon and/or sausage links (regular or maple) fresh fruit like oranges, berries, kiwi, pineapple etc. pork, turkey or veggie breakfast sausage patties. coffee, tea or orange juice. HOW TO STORE PANCAKES: Wrap 2 to 3 pancakes tightly in plastic wrap or store in an air-tight container for 2 to 5 days. Or wrap in plastic wrap and foil before storing in a freezer safe container/bag for up to 3 months. I hope you love this basic weekend pancake recipe as much as we do! Enjoy!

I noticed that rimmed pan that you use to keep the pancakes warm \u2013 I\u2019m not much of a shopper but I\u2019ve never seen a pan like that before! If I may ask, what brand is it and what do you mostly use it for? I sooo enjoy your recipes and your website\u2026 Thank you! Laurie McNamara \u2014 March 12, 2017 @ 3:29 pm Hi Linda! Thank you so much for leaving a comment and also pinning! The pan is by Nordic Ware and is from their prism collection. They come in all different sizes: half, full, deep-sided etc. But I use the quarter sheet pan for small batch roasting or keeping my pancakes or French toast warm in the oven \ud83d\ude42 Here\u2019s a link to the small one I have on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XRQG8D2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=simplyscrat04-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00XRQG8D2&linkId=674d6f791a39e0f9aeb56277b7d56ddf \u2764\ufe0f Jane S. \u2014 March 11, 2017 @ 9:30 am Reply This recipe is perfect for us!

Do you do that to keep the pancakes uniform? My 1st batch pancakes to hit the griddle usually have to get thrown out\u2026 I\u2019m wondering if this would help. Laurie McNamara \u2014 March 11, 2017 @ 3:39 pm Hi Christine! I do lightly grease the griddle with coconut oil, but I think pouring 1/4 cup of the batter straight onto the griddle and letting them spread out on their own may help you! Mine aren\u2019t perfectly uniform, but measuring the batter does help! Jolie \u2014 October 3, 2019 @ 8:26 pm Reply Loved these! Turned out perfectly! Laurie McNamara \u2014 October 4, 2019 @ 10:14 am I\u2019m so glad, Jolie! Jolie Wilkinson \u2014 October 26, 2020 @ 1:51 pm Reply Delicious pancakes! They made a snowy day so much better!

They do for M12 at least (comes with the new model jackets, I assume it can be bought separately somehow). Limited to 15w either way though apparently so it's pretty slow, but nice for things like being out of town if I need limited tool use or jacket use and can spare the time to charge.

Don't use it much but when I do it's extremely helpful. Mainly use it for laptops and occasionally charging phones. If you are already in the DeWalt eco system then it makes sense to use your existing batteries as big power banks. If you're not then don't bother. Plus I bring it when I do work at friends houses but bring my own tools so I don't have to bring a full size charger which saves space and weight. It's definitely more of a \"want\" purchase then a need but I feel I got my moneys worth. Wouldn't think twice at $65, again if you already have a lot of DeWalt batteries and tools. 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Andromayne Yesterday Apr 23, 2025 3:09 PM 120 Posts Joined Aug 2017 Yesterday Apr 23, 2025 3:09 PM Andromayne Yesterday Apr 23, 2025 3:09 PM 120 Posts Quote from dtgolder : Love to hear the ideas of how people are using this (fridge and soldering iron I'd not thought ot).

Then it holds the sweat, stays wet and that unleashes the stink and puts down the jock itch welcome mat. 7 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link threebeers 2d ago Apr 22, 2025 4:51 PM 2,332 Posts Joined Jan 2007 2d ago Apr 22, 2025 4:51 PM threebeers 2d ago Apr 22, 2025 4:51 PM 2,332 Posts Kind of tight down there for me, with this brand.

There's a reason that Under Armour and baselayers are made from polyester. 5 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link 1 Reply bbier Yesterday Apr 23, 2025 1:43 AM 430 Posts Joined Aug 2015 Yesterday Apr 23, 2025 1:43 AM bbier Yesterday Apr 23, 2025 1:43 AM 430 Posts Quote from TrentWalker : How is cotton better for exercising?

Promising reviews: \"Bought this dress because I always wanted to get the House of CB dress but didn\u2019t want to pay over $250 for it. It\u2019s honestly so good! I got the size large in this since they didn\u2019t have my normal sizes, which are small to medium (I have a bigger chest, so I tend to size up). But since this has a corset back, I was able to cinch it up really tight, and it fit perfectly!\" \u2014 Chris Herfurth Kennedy \"Beautiful, stunning perfection. This may be the best thing I've ever bought on Amazon. The corset in the back makes it fit like it was made for me. It's double-lined and not see-through at all, even though it's white. The straps are adjustable, the slit is a good height, and the fabric is slightly stretchy. I cannot say enough good things about it. It did come slightly wrinkly in the skirt, but nothing that a good steam won't fix.\" \u2014 Shoshanna Get it from Amazon for $57.99 (available in sizes 0\u201314 and 17 colors/styles). 23.

I was able to go into all of the temples without needing an extra cover. The striking color came out beautiful in my photos also. The material doesn't really wrinkle, so it was easy to pull out of the bag and throw on. It's not tight under the underarms, which made wearing it in the 100 degree weather much more comfortable.\" \u2014 dctreview Get it from Amazon for $35.99+ (available in 15 colors and sizes S\u2013XL). 24. A flowy boho style you'll get a ton of use out of in other seasons. It'll look equally amazing with cowboy boots or sandals. Cue to you in a piazza in Rome rocking this with your favorite accessory, a cone of gelato. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Reviewers say it runs a tad big because that's the style. Promising review: \"Bought this to wear to a concert and it was perfect! It does run a little big but not so big that you need to exchange. Super comfortable! Love it!\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $59+ (available in sizes S\u20132X and eight colors). 25.

Hello, Summer Goth. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought this for my birthday party this month (July). The dress came on time, fit me perfectly in every area and the material was fantastic for the price. I found no downsides to this dress other than the mesh is hotter than it looks. Having been born in the summer I\u2019m used to it but it\u2019s definitely toasty! I thought it was a beautiful addition to my closet. Dark but not tacky is my fashion goal LOL. I found it to be a bit itchy, but I have the most sensitive skin of all time. Overall I\u2019d buy this dress again, I loved it and so did everyone else!\" \u2014 Kelly Get it from Amazon for $37.98+ (available in sizes 2/4\u201318/20 and 15 styles/colors). 26. An airy nap dress I own and plan to wear as much as possible. It's super easy to adjust the puff sleeves from on- to off-the-shoulder to fit your mood. Elizabeth Lilly / BuzzFeed FYI, if you have Amazon Prime Wardrobe you can give this a spin before you buy it! I know, I look SO elegant and not at all like I've been running on ~three hours of sleep a night for going on a week at this point of my vacation, right?! I packed it for Italy knowing that I'd be going in lots of churches and religious sites that require having your shoulders and knees covered, and I pulled it off with this by merely slipping the sleeves up higher (as seen on the right when visiting the church with The Mouth of Truth from A Roman Holiday. ..turns out I'm NOT a liar after all). But I owned this dress months before I touched down in Rome and have been racking up compliments from strangers on the streets of NYC thanks to this frock. (\"Thanks! It's from Amazon!') It washes well, is super lightweight, and very easy to wear with a regular bra. The only thing it *doesn't* have is pockets. But I'll make an exception for this comfy beaut. Get it from Amazon for $36.99 (available in sizes XS\u2013XL and eight colors). 27. A tie-strap beaut in an ankle-grazing length for those moments when you've GOTTA stoop down and play with a puppy. This has you covered. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I absolutely love this dress! It\u2019s comfortable but also looks chic. I feel like it could be easily dressed up or down. I\u2019ve worn mine as a halter and regularly tied as pictured. It does run a bit large so I would size down if you\u2019re in between sizes. I ordered another color after receiving mine because it\u2019s so great!\" \u2014 Ally Estergard Get it from Amazon for $20.29 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and eight colors/patterns). 28. A striped cap sleeve midi \u2014 it might be the next best (and comfiest) thing to wearing a night gown out and about. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This summer dress is a must-have! I must have worn it at least once a week all summer long. It\u2019s so comfortable and the material is breathable.. even on humid days. The pockets are ideal and the flutter cap sleeves couldn\u2019t be cuter. I wore it with white sneakers, sandals and espadrilles so it\u2019s very versatile. Looking forward to pulling it out of the closet next summer.\" \u2014 Nikki Scott Get it from Amazon for $45.99+ (available in sizes 4\u201310 and sven styles). 29. A floor-length gown will look soooo pretty whether you're wearing it as a bridesmaid in your friend's wedding or in impromptu photo shoot by your pal who just got a new camera. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Dress is very pretty and it fit very well for my plus-size body type. I was super comfortable in it. I didn\u2019t feel like it made me look frumpy like some other dresses do. Bought size 22, the chest is for larger breasts so it was a little loose but it didn\u2019t collapse down if that makes since to anyone.\" \u2014 Jonella \"This is probably one of my favorite dresses! I ordered it for a wedding. The color is beautiful! The fit is perfection for a plus-size girl like myself. I usually wear a 14/16 in certain dresses. The 16 fit great!! I am 5\u20192, I will admit I should\u2019ve had the dress hemmed about two inches because I tripped a few times. But nothing worth complaining about.\" \u2014 Shay Jackson Get it from Amazon for $79.99+ (available in sizes 0\u201330 and in 31 colors) 30.

High recommend!\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $25.99+ (available in sizes XS\u2013XXL and nine colors/styles). 31. A versatile tiered maxi dress to layer with your longer-sleeve tops so you can comfortably sit in your chilly office. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com This dress is from Amazon's The Drop line. Promising review: \"I bought this dress for a trip to Miami. I wound up wearing it both as a dress and as a swimsuit cover-up and could not be happier. It is soft, breathable, and has deep, truly useable pockets. It packed very well and I felt pretty wearing it. Could not ask for more.\" \u2014 Becky in Iowa Get it from Amazon for $26.55+ (available in sizes XXS\u20135X and in 20 colors). 32.

I love black and white stripes and this dress, also, pockets!\" \u2014 Brinna Kerrick Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 31 colors/prints). 34. A pom-pom strap maxi for a stylish twist on the \"nap dress\" style we all rely on to keep us cool and chic when the sun starts to bake. Twirling in this is, in fact, mandatory, and lack of twirl is punishable by nap dress law. Amazon Promising review: \"I love this dress! It's light and airy, while still providing plenty of coverage. Cannot beat the price and the delivery time!\" \u2014 Stephane McCullen Get it from Amazon for $27.13+ (available in sizes XS\u2013XL and 24 prints).

Zimaboard 2 specifications: SoC \u2013 Intel Processor N150 quad-core \u201cTwin Lake\u201d processor @ up to 3.6 GHz (Turbo) with 6MB cache, 24EU Intel UHD graphics @ 1000 MHz; PBP: 6W (but set to 10W here) System Memory and Storage ZimaBoard 2 832 \u2013 8GB LPDDR5X 4800MHz; 32GB eMMC flash ZimaBoard 2 1664 \u2013 16GB LPDDR5X 4800MHz; 64GB eMMC flash 2x SATA 3.0 ports Video Output \u2013 Mini DisplayPort 1.4 up to 4K @ 60Hz Networking \u2013 2x 2.5GbE RJ45 ports USB \u2013 2x USB 3.1 Type-A ports Expansion PCIe 3.0 x4 slot LPC connector Misc 4-pin fan connector Front panel connector Power Supply 12V DC Input; 5A recommended when two SATA drives are used 12V DC output for 3.5-inch SATA drives Dimensions \u2013 140 x 83 x 17mm It\u2019s quite different than most other Intel Alder Lake/Twin Lake mini PCs thanks to its SATA ports and an externally accessible PCIe slot, which allows users to build a NAS, connect a powerful graphics card for gaming or AI applications, and more. The Zimaboard 2 ships pre-installed with the Debian-based ZimaOS Linux operating system, designed for NAS applications and an evolution of CasaOS. As an x86 platform, the mini PC also works with other Linux distributions, Windows, OpenWrt, pfSense, Android, and LibreELEC. ZimaOS dashboard on various types of devices The Zimaboard 2 thin design, SATA, and PCIe interfaces also make it suitable for clusters and installation in racks in a way similar to the Mixtile Blade 3 pico-ITX SBC with a Rockchip RK3588 octa-core Arm SoC and a U2 connector. The community made several interesting designs based on the previous generation Zimaboard, and IceWhale Technology also showcases a 10-inch rack for Zima with a Zimaboard 2 acting as a gateway, other Zimaboard 2 micro servers, 2.5/3.5-inch SATA drives, and additional storage using parts of the ZimaCube 6+1-bay NAS . 10-inch Rack for Zima Icewhale Technology has just launched the Intel N150 micro server and mini PC on Kickstarter with a 50,000 HKD (About $6,440 US) funding target that\u2019s been easily surpassed within the first few hours. Rewards start at $169 for the ZimaBoard 2 832 and $249 for the ZimaBoard 2 1664. The company also offers a mini NAS Kit, a Smart Home Kit, and a Master Kit with additional accessories. Shipping adds $15 to $40 depending on the destination country, and rewards are expected to ship by August 2025 if everything goes accordingly to plan. We should also get an early prototype for review soon, although the company has yet to ship it. Most information is explained on Kickstarter, but the product page might also have a few extra details.

Does anyone have any experience with this game? I pre-ordered it and have had it for a few months. I've painted a few of the models and have played it like 3 times. I talked my brother into it one night and he enjoyed it but was more focused on the Dodgers winning the world series. I don't get many others who want to play games with me so I like that you can play this one solo and it's actually pretty enjoyable! That goes for all Zombicide games, of course (or at least to my knowledge). I have the full kickstarter game on order. This smaller version is actually probably sufficient for me, gameplay wise, but I'm a pretty big DC fan and like painting models. The kickstarter comes with TONS, but this is a great deal.

It has been a slow and gradual feed of updates, but thanks to all the post-launch support, the game now has a lot of content that it didn\u2019t have when it originally launched. Well, Nintendo has released another update, even though the Nintendo Switch 2 is just a month and a half away from releasing. Once you download the update, F-Zero 99 should be at version 1.6.0. This is surprisingly a big update, with new tracks, a new special event and much more. You can see the official patch notes in full down below. New Additions Five Mirror tracks from the Ace League have been added. Mirror tracks will appear in F-ZERO 99 races as well as Pro Tracks, Team Battle, Mini Prix, Mirror Grand Prix, and Mini World Tour game modes. The usual tracks are flipped horizontally, and tracks where the gimmicks are rearranged will appear. Five Classic tracks have been added to the Ace League. These Classic tracks have been modified from F-ZERO 99 tracks in places to bring them closer to the track layouts from the BS F-ZERO GRAND PRIX Ace League. Classic tracks appear in both Classic and Classic Mini Prix game modes. Added Mini World Tour, a special event where pilots compete in seven consecutive races to compete for the top rank. The first Mini World Tour will be held on May 5. The Mini World Tour is a special event that will be held at regular intervals. The event will last for one week. The Mini World Tour is a series of seven races with each race consisting of three laps. The rules are based on a score system in which the rankings are determined by the total points awarded for each lap, the number of KOs, and the number of Gem Sparks collected during the three laps of the race. In Mini World Tour, the more players there are in the lobby, the more potential points players can earn during the race. During Mini World Tour races, a Mini World Tour tab will be displayed on the weekly leaderboard. A Mini World Tour category has been added to Prix under Records in the Workshop. This will be displayed while the Mini World Tour is being held and will remain displayed if a record is set. A player ranking in 999th place or above in the Mini World Tour weekly ranking will get a special badge. Mini World Tours will be held regularly, but this badge can only be obtained once during times when the event is live. Two types of decals and 15 color variations have been added for each of the BLUE THUNDER, LUNA BOMBER, GREEN AMAZON, and FIRE SCORPION machines. These can be used for customization when certain conditions are met. You can check the specified conditions and perform customization by selecting Workshop from the Main Menu. New backdrops, badges, and borders have been added for Pilot Card customization. All of these can be unlocked when certain conditions are met. You can check the specified conditions and perform customization by selecting Workshop from the Main Menu and then selecting Pilot Cards. Other Adjustments and Changes Changed the conditions for obtaining the black machine color to finishing in 1st in any of the following: F-ZERO 99, Pro Tracks, Grand Prix, or Mini Prix races. The color cannot be obtained by placing 1st in Team Battle, Classic races, or World Tour races. If conditions have been met with save data from Ver. 1.5.6 or prior, then the color will be obtained when the game is updated to Ver. 1.6.0. Made adjustments to machine balance. Machine Adjustments All Machines The amount of Super Sparks required to trigger the Super Boost has been slightly reduced. Increased the minimum amount of time to be on the Skyway from four seconds to five seconds. Increased speed when traveling on the Skyway without touching the wall and when using the Skyway dash plate. Adjusted the amount of increase in the Power Meter when scoring a KO against another machine. BLUE FALCON Reduced the amount of repulsion when colliding with other machines. GOLDEN FOX Reduced the amount of damage received and slightly reduced the amount of repulsion when colliding with other machines. The amount of Power Meter increase when you KO another machine will decrease with each KO after the first one. The advantage gained by getting many KOs early on in the World Tour and Grand Prix has been rebalanced. The maximum Power Meter value from stacking KOs remains at 200%, the same as before. The BLUE FALCON and GOLDEN FOX machines have been adjusted as they tend to keep getting knocked away by other machines and lose more power than desired in crowded situations. SILENCE, WHITE LAND II, and FIRE FIELD will appear as course candidates for Classic races. Other Fixes Fixed issues to make for a more pleasant gaming experience. Source Share this!

Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Climate Crisis Tweet Share Reddit Email Are we doomed? The short answer is: maybe not. As we all know, humanity is facing a climate breakdown. It\u2019s clear that we are in the early stages of a global catastrophe \u2013 and one that will happen, not some time in the distant future, but is impacting all of us, right now. What is also clear is that the situation will continue to deteriorate because we are doing very little to reduce the chances of avoiding \u2013 or at least mitigating \u2013 this disaster. The key indicator of the crisis is the continuing rise in global temperatures \u2013 in 2024, the average temperature was 1.6C above preindustrial levels because of the El Nino. We won\u2019t breach 1.5C for some years as a long-term average, but that turning point looms. The horrific wildfires that have occurred in California and around the world are harbingers of even greater climate disasters to come. According to Dr. John Millar (former Provincial Health Officer in British Columbia, Canada), the disasters which result from increasingly unsustainable amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will include (but will not be limited to): \u201c\u2026more wildfires, heat domes, droughts, floods, storms, hurricanes, melting permafrost, glaciers and sea ice, rising sea levels, and loss of species and biodiversity.\u201d In addition to rising CO2 emissions, there are many other ways in which we are polluting and destroying the very nature on which all life depends. The costs of these disasters, which are passed on to the population as a whole, are known to economists as \u201cexternalities\u201d, because the corporations which create them (such as industrial agriculture, clear-cutting forests, overfishing the oceans, and so on) do not have to pay for the damage that they cause to our environment and to humanity. Rather, these costs are \u201cexternalized\u201d to people and the natural world. One of the most serious of these externalities is the reduction in agricultural production, especially in poorer countries. Deforestation, such as in the Amazon rain forest, reduces both the ability of nature to absorb carbon from the air, and the amount of oxygen that trees and other plants release into our atmosphere. Destruction such as this are raising temperatures, leading to Increased global hunger and death \u2013 which is forcing tens of millions of desperate people to migrate from their uninhabitable homelands. Such displacement will lead to more wars and conflicts, both within and between countries. And inequality continues to increase. According to Oxfam, between 2020 and 2024, the richest five people in the world \u201chave doubled their fortunes. During the same period, almost five billion people globally have become poorer.\u201d Growing inequality is a major part of the problem. Not surprisingly, it is the richest people who can afford to consume the most \u201cstuff\u201d and who also indulge in the most environmentally costly activities \u2013 such as travelling in private jets and yachts, throwing elaborate parties, and building huge estates. Nevertheless, despite the growing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the corporate media (and the fossil fuel industry) have convinced much of the public that global CO2 emissions are actually being reduced, thanks to the increase in solar and wind technology, electric vehicles, heat pumps, and other forms of \u201cgreen\u201d energy. Unfortunately, the truth is just the opposite. William E. Rees, (Faculty of Applied Science, UBC), has pointed out that, in fact, \u201c\u2026globally the situation is worse, since demand for energy is increasing faster than renewables can be brought onstream, so the difference is being made up with increasing fossil fuel use.\u201d Rees, a pioneer in the field of human ecology, is probably best known for creating the concept of the \u201cecological footprint\u201d \u2013 an estimate of the biologically productive land and sea area needed to provide renewable resources that a given population consumes, as well as to absorb the wastes that they generate. At the current rate of resource demands, it would take 1.7 \u201cEarths\u201d to sustain human consumption. Unfortunately, another problem with renewables is the ecological costs of mining for the rare earth elements, like lithium, that are necessary for this technology to become widely available. Our dilemma is obviously unsustainable and is only getting worse. Rees emphasizes that, \u201cThe transition to renewable energy (globally especially) is not happening as fast as the demand for energy increases. The only sure way to reduce emissions and global ecocrisis generally (overshoot) is greatly reduced consumption \u2014 simpler lifestyles and smaller populations.\u201d The critical question, then, is how do we significantly reduce ecological destruction at the same time as we reduce global poverty? A fundamental starting point is to understand that the primary driving force of the ecocrisis is the insatiable greed of industrial and financial capitalism for profit and therefore, growth. John McMurty (Professor Emeritus of Philosophy, University of Guelph) explains in his, \u201cThe Cancer Stage of Capitalism\u201d , that the global economic system is based profit above all else and, like cancer, it will grow and grow until it destroys itself as well as its host. (As pro-capitalist guru Milton Friedman explained, corporations have no objective other than to make as much money as possible for their shareholders). And as Joel Bakan\u2019s classic book and documentary, The Corporation , argued, there are significant parallels between the behavior of large corporations and that of psychopaths. For example, the president has been loudly boasting that his policy toward the fossil fuel industry is, \u201cDrill Baby Drill!\u201d. and he has announced plans to dismantle the nation\u2019s leading disaster response agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), by October 1. He is also targeting efforts by states to reduce greenhouse gases, attacking the U.S. national park system, and doing all that he can to enrich the wealthy elites. Photo by Frank Cone: https://www.pexels.com/photo/wild-fire-on-mountains-2323799/ So, given the power of large corporations economically, politically, and ideologically, what can we do to curb their power before humanity passes the point of no return? To start with, we can keep in mind the words of the San Francisco detective played by Humphrey Bogart in, The Maltese Falcon : \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy to know what to do.\u201d And the Greek physician Hippocrates stressed an approach that is as vital to social movements as it is to medicine: \u201cFirst, do no harm.\u201d One implication of this maxim is that any solutions that we devise must prioritize the needs of the majority of people over that of the upper classes. Taxing back the wealth that they have stolen from their workers and their communities would more than cover the costs of an ecological \u201cNew Deal\u201d. Second, we need to create inclusive, mass democratic social movements, which are essential if we are to roll back the ecological and technological forces that are creating this existential crisis. As Social Ecologist Murray Bookchin understood over half a century ago, there are no individual solutions when it comes to taking on the power of the ruling classes \u2013 and each one of us can find a way to contribute that fits our particular situation. More recently, Erica Chenoweth (Harvard), has shown that, in the 20th century, an amazing 53% of nonviolent campaigns succeeded in their political goals. Every one of these campaigns which had active participation from at least 3.5 percent of the population succeeded, and many succeeded with even less support. Of course, almost every campaign had a majority of the population who supported \u2013 or at least did not oppose \u2013 the movement. The key factor, however, was having at least 3.5 percent of the population actively involved in the movement, using a host of non-violent tactics, including public education, boycotts, marches, electoral campaigns, and so on. And the goal of these movements? Rees explains that, \u201cOn a finite planet already in overshoot, it is not biophysically possible to raise the material standards of the poor to those of the rich sustainably \u2013 i.e. without destroying the ecosphere, undermining life support functions and precipitating the collapse of global society\u2026\u201d Instead, \u201cthe world community should cooperate on redistribution, on devising methods to share the benefits of development more equitably.\u201d If not, he warns, \u201ccollapse is inevitable\u201d. It\u2019s up to us. About the Author Peter G. Prontzos , faculty emeritus at Langara College in Vancouver, taught political science for over 25 years.

I normally use flannel sheets year-round because it\u2019s the only material I like, but these are my new favorites. Very soft and cooling. Fit our bed perfectly.

Check out what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord has to say about these : \"I've had one of these for a while, and I love it! I usually use an electric toothbrush, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively. I've switched to using this in the morning and the electric one at night and definitely see a difference in that area in particular.\" Promising review: \"This was another one of my TikTok purchases! I was skeptical, but my kids hate flossing their teeth, so I thought this might help in between making them floss. They work amazingly! My kids said they could see and feel a difference on the first use, and I agree! They are definitely worth a try! I would suggest not pushing too hard, those tiny bristles really get in there and if you push too hard you nights be sore like I was. It felt like after going to a dental cleaning.\" \u2014 AN Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 . 7. A small undetectable laptop mouse jiggler you can slide into the USB port because you should have the freedom to get up from your desk, even when working from the comfort of your home.

This is programmable for three settings, and I use it with minimal movement, so when I come back, everything is just as I left it. Revolutionary! Just remember to turn it on!\" \u2014 Isaiah Get it from Amazon for $8.99 . 8. An affordable cult-favorite luxury-scented candle reviewers compare to the uber-fancy Le Labo.

Emma Lord/BuzzFeed, Amazon See what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord has to say about this: I love love love this lip balm. I compare it to the $24 version from Summer Fridays, which I've been splurging on \u2014 I love that brand because it lasts so long and is so high quality, but this $4 E.l.f. version feels comparable and, more excitingly, comes in smaller versions so I can stock my totes and bathroom with them whether I'm at home or on the go. It's hydrating, lightweight, doesn't get sticky, and adds a perfect ~subtle~ gloss whether I'm using it alone or on top of a lip color. I love the vanilla flavor so much, it's got a similar vibe to the birthday cake flavor that Glossier sometimes carries. Promising review: \"I have one in my car, one in my purse, and one at home. These just feel so good on your lips! The flavors are very true to their name. They are pretty small, though, so if you use them often, it won\u2019t last long (which is another reason I have three of them), but for $4 each, it is worth it. I sometimes like using this before putting on the E.l.f. Lip Reviver Oil . Such a great base for an awesome lip oil!\" \u2014 Jax Get it from Amazon for $4 (available in five flavors). 10.

I had gastric sleeve surgery, and my hair was very, very thin. I started taking biotin and switched to biotin shampoo, as recommended by my doctor. It doesn\u2019t make your hair grow by washing it, but it makes your hair and roots stronger. And it worked. After using the whole bottle, my hair was stronger. I had a lot of new growth that was sticking around (the previous new growth fell out early on), and my hair was getting thicker. Eight months later, my hair is back to normal.

Now I can have a glass of wine and not have to dart to a package of antihistamine! Makes a great gift. Even thinking of splitting a box into stocking stuffers. Each wand is individually wrapped. Have purchased these several times and will continue to do so.\" \u2014 KellyH Get a set of three from Amazon for $11.99 . 13. A stainless-steel tongue scraper to freshen up your breath and ensure your tongue is clean and gunk-free (a trip to the dentist not required). www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Basic Concepts is a small business that specializes in personal care products, home goods, and office essentials. Promising review: \"My husband and I have been using this product for a couple of months now and we both think it is worth the purchase. It is not a magic fixer for bad breath or lack of oral hygiene but paired with a good dental hygiene routine we have noticed a positive difference such as fresher breath for longer and fresher breath upon waking in the morning. It is easy to clean, and the shape prevents gagging. All in all the product is definitely worth it.\" \u2014 Brimichelle Get it from Amazon for $5.99 . 14. Plus, a set of teeth-whitening strips to brighten each and every tooth so that your smile is as \u2728shiny\u2728 as can be.

This did an unreal job on my hair!! I was skeptical (tried a little bit first because I was petrified it would burn off my hair and I would end up bald!) but lo and behold, it was magic! My hair is so strong, silky, and healthy looking after just one use. Plus, you can\u2019t beat the price! Have already ordered another box. I should also add I have curly/wavy hair that\u2019s been colored to a light brown. Buy it!!\" \u2014 BB Check out BuzzFeed's full review of the Elizavecca hair treatment for more deets!

Now I just keep a few wrapped up in the glove box that fit older connections. Great that the cables retract out of the way . Only complaint could be that it is rather large, but it is to be expected with four connections. Little car voltage display is nice to have as well (everyone should have one of these, by the voltage amount it shows if your alternator is working).\" \u2014 Jaxmoto Get it from Amazon for $25.99 (also available in a version that *ONLY* has two Apple retractable chargers !). 22.

The scent is, for me anyway, like aromatherapy. It smells like an iced sugar cookie, and is a great base layer for fragrance. Very relaxing. \" \u2014 Dragonheart Jo Get it from Amazon for $8.98 (available in eight scents, and packs of two or three). 23. A Cosori gooseneck electric kettle that is both pretty, practical, and oh-so-similar to the fast-boiling Fellow Stagg kettle.

It looks modern and sleek. The temperature controls are accurate and plenty. The boiling speed and 'hold' function are amazing.

I had already been using Lume deodorant for a few years now and was looking for something else as I felt I\u2019m building a resistance to it. I should\u2019ve been using this to begin with. Second application I applied to other areas of my body, zero sweat. Amazed.\" \u2014 Hanna L. Hetz Get a 10-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (each box lasts two months). 25.

Promising reviews: \"I've had my eye on a Dyson Airwrap, but given the cost, I figured I'd try this while I save up. This thing is fantastic. I have waist-length hair that's naturally straight, but gets frizzy when damp. I've had salon blowouts that have left my hair looking great, but I simply can't manage a round brush without it getting tangled in my hair. This device has been a game changer. It works best if you air dry for a while before you use it, then use it to finish your style.

By John F. Di Leo \u201cHarvard is fighting back.\u201d There was a time when more colleges had ROTC units, producing soldiers, sailors, and pilots every year, patriotically rallying to the cause in wartime, fighting for their country. It\u2019s been a long time since that was the norm. Since the 1960s and 1970s, our nation\u2019s colleges have been identified with pacifism. The idea that an American college would do any fighting at all sounds more like Ancient History than Current Events. But now the professors of Harvard Yard are fighting mad. They\u2019re holding press conferences and firing off op-eds, trying to rally other colleges to their cause. And what is their \u201ccause\u201d? Unlimited government funding, free from the limitations of a desperately needed federal austerity program. The college is willing to fight \u2014 against our own virtually bankrupt federal government \u2014 to keep the cornucopia of federal taxpayer-funded checks flowing, when President Donald Trump is trying to shut off the spigot. Since the Executive Branch issues a lot of checks to Harvard \u2014 and to most colleges, in fact, to darned near all of them \u2014 the Trump administration has put its foot down. They have determined that since part of their mandate is to bring common sense back to our country, this is no time to fund a bunch of overpaid countercultural Marxist rabble-rousers. It\u2019s no time to enable their worst inclinations, from race- and sex-based hiring to forcing \u201cgirls\u2019 sports\u201d to include boys, from sitting back while student groups abuse their Jewish classmates to actively facilitating the selling out of their country through partnerships with hostile foreign governments. So yes, the Trump administration is cutting off some of the checks. And as it turns out, Harvard University doesn\u2019t believe that ferociously biting the hand that feeds it for years beyond count ought to be grounds for ending the gravy train. What will be the general public\u2019s reaction? I wonder. For generations, parents have watched their children\u2019s applications be rejected while students with worse preparation, worse grades, and worse test scores have been accepted to elite colleges, causing their own children to have to settle for lesser schools as their punishment for being white or Asian or middle-class or normal. For generations, parents have stared at their children\u2019s course descriptions and reading lists, horrified at the dreck being assigned for full course credit, the once noble institution of higher education having long ago plummeted to a nadir by offering pretend majors like \u201cGender Studies\u201d and \u201cMulti-Cultural Inquiry.\u201d And we\u2019ve seen all this go on, as their prices climbed higher and higher, charging whatever a subsidized market will bear. Too many colleges brazenly encourage their students to take on outrageous levels of debt \u2014 obligations certain to hang over the heads of most of their graduates for decades \u2014 as the coursework hardly ever prepares a student for legitimate careers that would actually enable them to pay back these loans. If you were one of these parents \u2014 and you probably are \u2014 who\u2019ve watched your children emerge from those ivy-covered dens of iniquity awash in debt, unprepared for life and robbed of their values \u2014 are you likely to side with these pompous college spokesmen or with the president you\u2019ve now voted for three times? If we have this fight in the public eye, then be prepared for everything to be exposed. Our nations\u2019 colleges and universities are estimated to have upwards of a trillion dollars in endowments. Harvard alone has over $50 billion. And still they keep begging their alumni for donations as if they were paupers on a street corner. Despite sitting on Midas-level hoards, our most expensive colleges remain prohibitive even during recessions. While a few institutions \u2014 such as Purdue and Hillsdale \u2014 stand out for trying to keep tuition increases down, the majority have happily raised their tuition, room, and board far beyond the rate of inflation for decades, enabling those endowments to just grow and grow. The more prestigious a school is, the more it values foreign students, because those customers rarely need to be discounted. The children of Middle Eastern sheiks, communist Chinese apparatchiks, and European Union bureaucrats can pay the full price, so America\u2019s colleges look less and less like America every year. Why take a normal kid from suburban Cincinnati, rural South Carolina, or the plains of Nebraska, whose FAFSA requires a discounted rate, when you can instead take a kid from Beijing whose father sits on Xi Jinping\u2019s politburo, and whose political connections might help the college develop some big deal? And speaking of foreign deals, long gone are the days when colleges were quiet buildings with classrooms devoted to the liberal arts \u2014 history, economics, language, literature, etc. Today\u2019s schools aspire to being known as \u201cresearch universities\u201d \u2014 which require expensive collaborations with private companies involved in the manufacturing, inventing, and improving of products and technologies. Such fields are usually patent-protected or even export-controlled for national security reasons, but these colleges are notorious for playing fast and loose with both private and public intellectual property concerns, often resulting in the transfer of sensitive knowledge to our nation\u2019s biggest enemies. Just as at least a million foreign students attend American colleges each year, the many American public and private universities ( at least 77 at last count ) with foreign campuses ensure that a similar number of American students spend a semester or more on their colleges\u2019 distant foreign campuses. These hundreds of foreign campuses cause massive foreign money to pour into the American higher education system, and that money comes with strings, ranging from professor exchanges to situating cultural centers near our campuses, spreading philosophies such as jihad and Marxism even in the communities outside the colleges themselves. Since October 7, 2023, we have watched with shock as our universities spawned huge anti-Israel and anti-Jewish protests, clearly \u201castroturfed\u201d with outside money but populated by both current foreign students and huge numbers of former students who have been overstaying their visas. These protests showed not only how our lax immigration policy has caused us to lose track of these former students when their visas expired, but also how mistaken the liberal theory is that welcoming foreigners here en masse for college would \u201ccivilize and democratize\u201d them. Many of these protesters were as hateful and violent in Chicago or New York as they would have been back home in Syria or Saudi Arabia. And even the colleges that were once religious institutions, with boys-only and girls-only dorms to protect our youth from the dangers of sex, drink, and drugs, are now at the forefront of a libertine lifestyle that would horrify their colleges\u2019 founding ministers and seminarians \u2014 the dorms rampant with STDs, pregnancies and abortions, and the girls\u2019 sports teams forced to give their awards to men in drag. That\u2019s what this federal money has been propping up all these years. The colleges demand more joint research projects to give away to our enemies, more foreign elites\u2019 children to corrupt our own, more opportunities to practice such bigotry as DIE and BDS, free rein to depress the once-high standards of academia even more than they have already done. For generations now, far too many of our colleges and universities have been funding an increasingly hostile tumor in the body politic. We want to value them for the good work they do in producing great engineers, scientists, doctors, and inventors, but the balance between these positives and their plethora of societal negatives is off kilter. It\u2019s time to end the gravy train. And if our colleges really want to fight this out in the public square, as if the above sample of the case against them weren\u2019t enough, let\u2019s have at it. John F.

Powell Across cultures throughout human history, people have sought to flee oppression and escape persecution. A recurring theme in Western literature and in modern classics such as Superman and Disney originals, which revolve around the struggle between good and evil, is the need and critical role for a rescuer or savior. Easter is the celebration of the finished work of the messiah Jesus Christ, the ultimate rescuer and savior for mankind, who sacrificed his life to provide forgiveness of sin -- enabling all who believe in Christ to have a direct relationship with God. That no other religion makes the claim that it was founded by a messiah makes Jesus the most revolutionary figure of human history. Still, some assume Christianity is like other religions that require followers to perform certain works and rituals acceptable to God. Not so with Jesus, for he implores us in Matthew 11:30 that, \u201cMy yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\u201d When a learned Jewish Pharisee, whose life required living up to stressful \u201cdos and don\u2019ts\u201d of the Mosaic law, asked Jesus which was the greatest commandment in the law, Jesus answered simply that if we love God and love our neighbor as ourselves, we will have fulfilled all the laws. Christ is absolutely unique in other ways. First, he is the only person in history who was pre-announced starting a thousand years before he was born, with eighteen different prophets between the tenth and the fourth centuries B.C. predicting his coming birth, life, and death. Hundreds of years later, the details of Christ\u2019s coming birth, life, betrayal, and manner of death validated those prophecies in surprisingly accurate and minute detail. One thousand years B.C., David prophetically wrote about the crucifixion of Christ, at a time when crucifixion was unknown as a means of execution. The death of other religious leaders -- such as Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Mohammad, or Confucius -- brought anticlimactic endings to their lives and work. But Christ came into the world as God\u2019s son to die and pay the price for man\u2019s iniquity. His sacrifice was the ultimate climax of his life, done for the benefit of mankind -- opening the way, for all who believe -- to earthly fulfillment and a joyful afterlife. The essence of Easter\u2019s celebration of the Resurrection is that Christianity\u2019s founder, Jesus, is still alive, having overcome death. No Jew ever believed that, after Abraham died and was interred, his tomb ever became empty. After Buddha died, no disciple ever claimed that they saw or spoke to him again. As for Mohammed and his teachings that are the basis of Islam, he never appeared to his followers after he had died at age sixty-one. His occupied tomb located in Medina is visited by tens of thousands of devout Muslims every year. The \u201cseeing is believing\u201d evidence of God\u2019s power and love, is that Jesus was brought back from being dead in a tomb to being alive -- resurrected -- so that people would have living proof of who he was. The New Testament provides accounts from multiple sources who witnessed Jesus firsthand after the resurrection. Jesus made ten separate appearances to his disciples between the resurrection and his ascension into Heaven -- a period of forty days. Those appearances were to individual disciples, several disciples at the same time, and once to five hundred people at one time. It is noteworthy that there were no accounts or witnesses who came forth and disputed these appearances, or called them a \u201choax,\u201d not even one. Nor is there any record of any witness accounts that were contradictory. Skeptics of the Biblical account of Jesus must come to terms with the fact that there is more reliable historical evidence for his life, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection than there is evidence for any other historical figure of ancient times. Consider, for instance, that the authenticity of Alexander the Great, who was born some 350 years before Christ, is based on two original biographical accounts of his life by Arrian and Plutarch, which were written some 400 years after Alexander died. The manuscripts of Virgil and Horace, both of whom lived within a generation of Christ, were put into writing more than four centuries after their deaths. Yet no one doubts Virgil and Horace lived and authored great poetic masterpieces. Similarly, the historical record of Alexander the Great is unquestioned. The reliability of ancient history is determined by three variables: the number of eyewitness accounts; the lapse of time between eyewitness accounts and the written record; and the number of surviving manuscripts of that written record. Looking at the big picture there are about one thousand times more manuscripts preserving the deeds and teaching of Jesus in the New Testament (about twenty-five thousand) than there are preserving other classical ancient works of historic figures who lived at approximately the same time, with the exception of Homer, whose Iliad is backed by eighteen hundred manuscripts. But that is still less than one-tenth the number of ancient manuscripts that back the authenticity of Jesus\u2019 life recorded in the New Testament. We know the historical Jesus through four different accounts known as the Gospels -- Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John -- not written hundreds of years later, but within a generation or two of Jesus\u2019s life. Apostles Matthew and John provide eyewitness accounts from their years of walking with Jesus as disciples. Mark also had eyewitness experience, although he was only a teenager when Jesus began his public ministry. Luke, the doctor, learned about Jesus from his friend Paul, the Apostle who wrote most of the Letters of the New Testament. Because of their experience with the resurrected Jesus, the apostles were in a unique position, knowing with certainty that Jesus was truly the Son of God. They had witnessed the unparalleled love, profound teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection of Jesus. If the claims about Jesus were a lie, the apostles would have known it. That is why their commitment to their testimony was so powerful and compelling. Additionally, the apostles\u2019 willingness to die for their claims has tremendous evidentiary value -- and confirms the truth of the resurrection. No one will die for something contrived or false. Seeing, talking to, and touching the risen Jesus transformed the apostles, who then committed the rest of their lives to sharing the message of salvation through Christ. Apart from John, who was banished to the island of Patmos for his testimony of Jesus, the other eleven apostles -- including Matthias, who replaced Judas, the betrayer of Jesus -- died as martyrs for their beliefs in the divinity of Christ. It turns out that Easter, which has its ultimate meaning through the resurrection, is one of ancient history\u2019s most scrutinized and best attested events.

These actions have strained relationships with allies and jeopardized efforts to tax digital services and implement a global minimum corporate tax rate. Reuters Global tax plans targeting billionaires and multinational companies are running aground, with the United States torpedoing reforms under President Donald Trump . The billionaire real estate tycoon has pulled the United States out of an international deal on taxing multinationals and threatened tariffs on countries that target US tech giants. Here is a look at the state of play: Big tech taxes Countries have accused Amazon, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet and Facebook's parent company Meta of sidestepping local taxes. Live Events Trump issued a warning on February 21 to countries that would hit big tech and other US companies with fines or taxes that are \"discriminatory, disproportionate\" or designed to transfer funds to local companies. \"My administration will act, imposing tariffs and taking such other responsive actions necessary to mitigate the harm to the United States,\" he said in the memo. The move reopens a rift between Washington and its allies over taxing digital services. During his first term, Trump threatened to slap tariffs on US imports of champagne and French cheese after France rolled out a digital services tax in 2019. Seven other countries have followed France's lead since then. The tax generated 780 million euros ($887 million) for the French government last year. Now the European Union is threatening to impose a tax on digital services if negotiations fail over Trump's plans to impose 20 percent tariffs on EU goods. Britain, which is hoping to strike a trade deal with the United States, may reconsider its own digital levy, which currently brings in \u00a3800 million annually. British Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has said the digital tax is not \"something that can never change or we can never have a conversation about\". Global corporate tax Nearly 140 countries struck a deal in 2021 to tax multinational companies, an agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD agreement has two \"pillars\". The first provides for the taxation of companies in countries where they make their profits, a move aimed at limiting tax evasion. It primarily targets tech giants. Pillar two, which sets a minimum global rate of 15 percent, has been adopted by around 60 economies, including Brazil, Britain, Canada, the EU, Switzerland and Japan. Daniel Bunn, head of the Tax Foundation, a US non-profit think-tank, said negotiations on implementation of the first pillar \"have been stalled for some time\", even under Joe Biden's presidency. Franco-American economist Gabriel Zucman told AFP that the EU's reaction in the coming weeks \"will be crucial\". \"If the EU and other countries give up and allow American multinationals to exempt themselves, it will unfortunately spell the end of this very important agreement,\" he said. Tax the rich Efforts to tax the world's ultra-wealthy are also stalling. Brazil used its time as chair of the G20 to push for a plan to impose a two percent minimum tax on the net worth of individuals with more than $1 billion in assets, a project estimated to raise as much as $250 billion per year. The Biden administration baulked at the plan and it is unlikely to get any traction with Trump -- a billionaire himself and proponent of tax cuts -- at the White House. Almost a third of the world's billionaires are from the United States -- more than China, India and Germany combined, according to Forbes magazine. At a recent conference in Paris, French economist Thomas Piketty said the world cannot wait for the G20 to all agree. \"We need individual countries to act as soon as they can,\" he said. \"History suggests that once you have a couple of countries who adopt a certain kind of reform, in particular powerful countries, it becomes sort of a new standard.\" (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel ) Read More News on Trump administration tax policies global tax plans tax billionaires tech giants taxation trump tax the rich (Catch all the Business News , Breaking News , Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times .)

Nintendo has one of the most storied histories in gaming having been in the business for roughly 50 years. Nintendo has been making video games since the 1970s and has been making consoles for almost just as long. They\u2019ve innovated for decades and without Nintendo, gaming would look a lot different than it does today. Over the years, Nintendo has released numerous consoles and handhelds and while not all of them have been smash hits, they remain one of the major video game companies. Videos by ComicBook.com Later this year, Nintendo will release one of its most anticipated consoles ever in the form of the very pricey Nintendo Switch 2 . The $450 console is set to arrive in early June and usher in a new era for Nintendo as it doubles down on portability without compromising much in the way of power. It\u2019s expected that the console will be comparable to a PS4 Pro, which isn\u2019t a bad thing given a lot of games are still releasing on last-gen (for better or worse). With all of that said, Nintendo is likely going to pull out all of the stops to market this bad boy and make it one of the most in-demand pieces of tech this year. Paul Rudd Parodies His 90s SNES Ad in New Nintendo Switch 2 Commercial Play video As fans prepare for Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders to open up next week, Nintendo has released a brand new ad for the console starring Paul Rudd. This ad is a throwback to one of, if not the very first ever on-screen appearances for Rudd. The Marvel actor starred in a 1991 ad for the SNES which feels very 90s now thanks to the wardrobe, fog machines, and editing style. It\u2019s a pretty iconic ad now and helped give birth to one of Hollywood\u2019s most beloved stars and a Marvel icon as a result. Rudd dons his signature 90s outfit and hairstyle in this new Nintendo Switch 2 while mimicking the over the top voiceover for the SNES ad before utilizing the console\u2019s new Game Chat feature to play Mario Kart World with some of his friends. He notes at the end that while it\u2019s nice to play with power, it\u2019s better to play together, something the Nintendo Switch 2 seems to be emphasizing across a lot of its marketing. It\u2019s a fun way to reference something that frequently makes the rounds on social media while also marketing the Nintendo Switch 2. It\u2019s a pretty great ad that showcases exactly what you can expect out of the console, particularly when it comes to online gaming. As of right now, Nintendo hasn\u2019t made clear just how available Nintendo Switch 2 will be on day one. It\u2019s expected that it won\u2019t be as hard to get one in its first year as it was to get a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2020 and 2021, but it remains to be seen just how prepared Nintendo actually is for this console\u2019s release. If you\u2019re particularly interested in getting a Nintendo Switch 2 on day one, there will be a bunch of ways to make that happen. GameStop has revealed that it will be hosting a midnight release for the Nintendo Switch 2 in addition to Best Buy. However, it seems like Amazon will not be partaking in Nintendo Switch 2 sales as the two companies appear to have some sort of beef that has yet to be squashed. Of course, that could change eventually, but this has been ongoing for a while now and this will be the biggest blow to Amazon when it comes to Nintendo products.

Season 3 of The Wheel of Time has come to a close, but each of the main characters should return in season 4 to continue their narratives. The epic fantasy TV series is adapted from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time books , but due to the order of events being changed to better fit the television medium, it's become harder to discern where exactly the show will go from here. Season 3 adapted The Shadow Rising , which would make The Fires of Heaven the natural progression, but it likely won't be so straightforward. The Amazon Prime Video adaptation skipped book three, The Dragon Reborn , meaning they'll likely go back for at least the important parts. The Wheel of Time show's next book to adapt will primarily be The Fires of Heaven , but the series also seems to have set up stories from Lord of Chaos and even Towers of Midnight , the thirteenth book in the series . These are just predictions, but they're based on how the events of the season unfolded for specific characters. 6 Rand Rand Needs To Go To Tear Close Rand's story heading into season 4 is possibly the most clear. As the Dragon Reborn , he needs to continue fulfilling the Karaethon Cycle, the prophecy that will help prepare him for the Last Battle. The next step, at least in the chronology of the books, is a step backward, as he needs to obtain the sa'angreal sword, Callandor, from a fortress known as the Stone of Tear . This may have come as a point of confusion to book readers, as that happens before The Shadow Rising in Robert Jordan's version. Related Every Major Character Death In The Wheel Of Time Season 3 & How They Differ From The Books There are six major deaths in The Wheel of Time season 3, all of which differ notably from the books' storylines. Here's our breakdown. Posts Speaking with RadioTimes before the season, producer and Moiraine actress Rosamund Pike explained skipping The Dragon Reborn , saying, \" We haven't neglected the Stone of Tear, we've just rearranged the order. \" Moiraine also mentioned in The Wheel of Time season 3's ending that now, with the Aiel on Rand's side, he'll have an army to take the Stone of Tear. Obtaining Callandor will likely be Rand's next objective, but after that, he can continue with his narrative from The Fires of Heaven , taking him to Caemlyn, the capital city of Andor. 5 Moiraine & Lan Moiraine's Fate Might Drastically Change In The Show Close Moiraine's story going forward is somewhat confusing, as her character actually disappears for several novels in the middle of The Fires of Heaven . This occurs during a battle with Lanfear, where the two of them fall through a redstone gateway and aren't seen again. Given that we already saw Moiraine and Lanfear go at it in the season 3 finale and that Rosamund Pike is the show's main star and one of its producers, it seems doubtful they'd kill her off for a significant portion of the story. Related Surprise Forsaken Death Removes Almost An Entire Book From The Wheel Of Time's Future One of The Wheel of Time's character deaths marks yet another notable change from the novels. Here's how it will affect Rand's future and more. Posts 2 The best prediction I have is that Moiraine will learn of the events at the White Tower and, hearing of Siuan Sanche's fate, will take up much of her role in the subsequent novels after she's done grieving. This means mentoring Egwene and helping the rebel Aes Sedai faction form against Elaida's White Tower. Lan was barely featured in The Wheel of Time season 3, but there were multiple hints at his regal past. His storyline could lead him back to Nynaeve, or he could simply remain by Moiraine's side for the time being. 4 Mat Mat's Show Differences Make Him Hard To Pin Down Close Mat has been one of the most difficult characters to predict in the television adaptation, because he's been almost entirely out of place since season 2 began . Mat spends The Shadow Rising and a decent amount of The Fires of Heaven in the Aiel Waste with Rand, so the fact that he was in Tanchico in season 3 likely means further deviation for his character. He may continue to follow Nynaeve and Elayne, or he could reunite with Rand in Cairhien. Given the show's differences in his development, his narrative is challenging to predict. Mat Cauthon is a fantastic character in the books, but he's been sidelined for most of the TV series. Much of his conflict in the books sees him trying to escape from Aes Sedai, the One Power, and even Rand al'Thor, once he realizes that his friend is the Dragon Reborn. He wants little to do with responsibility of any sort, which is why he wishes to be rid of the One Power when he meets the Eelfinn in the books. Given the show's differences in his development, his narrative is challenging to predict. 3 Perrin Perrin Will Resolve His Conflict With The White Cloaks Close Perrin's return to the Two Rivers in season 3 was fairly direct from The Shadow Rising , but his path forward is more difficult to ascertain. Book four of Jordan's series ends with Perrin refusing to be apprehended by the White Cloaks, then they leave, and he remains in the Two Rivers to recover from his battle wounds, making him absent in The Fires of Heaven . The TV series isn't going to eliminate Perrin for an entire season, which is probably why they changed his ending to have him go with the White Cloaks. The TV series isn't going to eliminate Perrin for an entire season, which is probably why they changed his ending to have him go with the White Cloaks. Perrin's next storyline in the show is likely going to be drawn from Towers of Midnight , which is the book where he finally has his confrontation with Dain Bornhald and the Children of the Light . His submission to the White Cloaks means that this plotline will happen much sooner than it does in the books. He could reunite with his friends toward the end of the season, but Perrin might spend the majority of season 4 captured and arguing for his life in the White Cloaks' trial. 2 Nynaeve & Elayne This Pair Will Continue To Pursue The Black Ajah Close Nynaeve and Elayne will remain together for most of The Wheel of Time season 4, resuming their story from Tanchico. Moghedien has taken the Domination Bands, and the Black Ajah are still on the loose, with Liandrin looking to become a Forsaken. Nynaeve's story in The Fires of Heaven sees her continuing to pursue Moghedien, this time in Tel'aran'rhiod, the World of Dreams . This will likely involve Liandrin as well, and could result in the Black Ajah attempting to capture Rand with the Domination Bands . There will be some points of interest in The Fires of Heaven regarding Elayne's family in Caemlyn, especially with Rand going to fight Rahvin. For the most part, she'll be by Nynaeve's side with the pair of them making their way to the rebel Aes Sedai camp. This includes obstacles like them joining a traveling circus and reuniting with Galad Damodred, who has become a White Cloak. The TV show may skim over most of their travels and have them remain in direct pursuit of the Black Ajah and Forsaken. 1 Egwene Egwene Could Join The Rebel Aes Sedai Camp Close Egwene doesn't have a terrible amount to do in The Fires of Heaven , with most of it still in the Aiel Waste. If the aforementioned prediction is true about the TV show moving ahead and skipping Moiraine's death, Egwene's story could head straight to Lord of Chaos , which would involve her joining the Rebel Aes Sedai camp in Salidar , meaning she could have some massive developments by the end of season 4. In season 3, she progressed through her training as a Dreamwalker rather quickly and was able to help defeat Lanfear, but this will also develop further. A notable aspect of the TV series is that the show still hasn't shut down the Egwene Rand romance, which is finalized in The Shadow Rising . The Wheel of Time show still explored it toward the end of season 3, with Rand's romantic interest in Lanfear sticking a wedge between them. In the books, Egwene has already begun considering Gawyn Trakand, Elayne's brother, whom we met earlier in season 3.

In fact, I recommend it to all our competitors.\" In a recent interview with Y Combinator\u2019s Garry Tan, he said join Zepto if you're looking to do the best work of your life. ETtech Aadit Palicha, founder, Zepto Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha has delivered a clear message about the company\u2019s high-performance culture, stating that the quick commerce platform is not the place for those seeking traditional work-life balance. Speaking with startup accelerator Y Combinator \u2019s Garry Tan, Palicha reinforced a tweet he had posted in December last year: \"Nothing against work-life balance. In fact, I recommend it to all our competitors.\" \u2014 aadit_palicha (@aadit_palicha) Palicha said, \u201cJoin here if you're really looking to do the best work of your life. This is a very execution-focused culture. Everyone is deep into the game, solving real problems every day. That\u2019s how you become the best version of yourself.\u201d Also Read: Until we can match Amazon or DoorDash, we haven\u2019t won: Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha Live Events Palicha emphasised that the intensity of Zepto's culture isn\u2019t for everyone, but is designed for \u201cthe super ambitious, the super capable\u201d who want to stretch themselves to their limits \u2014 at least for a phase in their careers.

Palicha said he aims to create similar inspiration at Zepto: \u201cLet\u2019s build a truly great internet company in India. Let\u2019s kick off the internet revolution in India that should have been much bigger than it is today.\u201d He believes Indian startups can create 10x more value for the country and sees Zepto\u2019s mission as part of a broader national transformation, similar to what internet companies sparked in China. \u201cMaybe we can play a small part in that,\u201d he added. Palicha\u2019s remarks come at a time when work-life balance is a growing priority for India\u2019s workforce , especially among tech and startup professionals.

In the last 2 years, I had one factory repair (new motor assembly for $70) plus I upgraded to M2 burrs. But then it bit the dust. I've replaced it with the \"OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder\". Been very pleased with that it so far.

I'm really glad to see the parts page is still alive: https://www.baratza.com/en-us/lan...duct/parts . So long as that's true, I wholeheartedly recommend this grinder. I had to repair it after 8 years, and it's been another 4 years without issue since then. 3 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Sign up for a Slickdeals account to remove this ad. ajtaurus2011 Yesterday Apr 20, 2025 3:17 AM 505 Posts Joined Jul 2013 Yesterday Apr 20, 2025 3:17 AM ajtaurus2011 Yesterday Apr 20, 2025 3:17 AM 505 Posts Quote from W33Z : This is indeed a nice grinder.

AlgoTrading on 20/04/2025 - 12:38 +2 I use this at my parents' place and honestly unless everyone on the network is streaming 4k, dual band is also fine Anubizz on 20/04/2025 - 14:36 You internet mostlikely give up first before the router reach it limit. walawe on 20/04/2025 - 16:37 How does this compare with google nest wifi pro? Maths Debater on 21/04/2025 - 02:05 +1 It doesn't. You're comparing AX1800 with AXE4200. MoonSha on 20/04/2025 - 17:34 Got the 2-pack for my parents place 6 months ago on that previous deal. Hasn't needed a restart yet and I could set it to auto firmware update at 3am so it's been completely set and forget. Wifi strength seems good, certainly much better than the single AP which was struggling to reach the further rooms of their house.

Posted 23 hours ago Subscribe to Shopping Newsletter Caret Down 35 Products With Results That\u2019ll Really And Truly Dazzle You Just in absolute awe seeing the results of these products and how well they work. by Samantha Wieder BuzzFeed Staff Facebook Pinterest Link 1. A fan-favorite Sol de Janeiro body cream made with guarana and cupuacu butter to bring smoothness and hydration to your skin. Best of all, it has a delish pistachio, salted caramel, and vanilla scent and is gonna have everyone you talk to commenting on how darn good you smell. Amazon, www.amazon.com Caffeine has a number of skincare benefits, including brightening and temporarily reducing the appearance of stretch marks and cellulite, if that's something you're looking to do! You can read more about the skincare benefits of caffeine at the Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: \"Like so many, I was brainwashed by TikTok into buying this rather expensive lotion...then I bought one for my mom, one for my sister, and five more for myself as they became harder to find. My favorite thing about it is the smell. Lightly tropical/coconutty but nothing overwhelming. Every time I wear it, people say, 'What are you WEARING?' like I have some amazing perfume on. Besides that, it really is a great moisturizer. I\u2019m not usually a sucker for marketing, but this was so worth it. \" \u2014 Kristen Get it from Amazon for $24+ (available in three sizes). And if (when) you do fall in love with the scent, they make tons of other products , including a fragrance ! 2. A portable carpet and upholstery cleaner that boasts strong spray and suction so cleaning stubborn stains will feel effortless. Messes left behind by pets or small children shouldn't mean permanently ruined carpets, furniture, or car interiors. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Each cleaner comes with a trial size of Bissell's Spot & Stain Formula , which is also available on Amazon for $12.99 ! Promising review: \"My daughter is the queen of spilling juice on her bed, and I never fully realized the damage/dirt it was causing. My sister bought this and I decided to try, and it is worth every single penny!! I sprayed the bed down with the machine and I left for about five minutes, came back, and began to actually do the suction. It took about 15 minutes to finish but some lighter stains disappeared right away \u2014 no scrubbing needed. \" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $119+ (available in three styles). 3. An aloe and coconut oil after-sun soothing cream because I'm going to make a fair assumption that with nicer days ahead, you'll be spending more time outside, which means an increased risk of burns. Listen, I trust that you'll be smart and protect yourself from Mr. Golden Sun, but sometimes...the inevitable happens. This stuff will help hydrate your skin afterward and leave it feeling refreshed, moisturized, and itch-free post-burn. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I burn very easily, so I try to stay out of the sun or wear tons of sunblock. On those days when I still manage to get burned, this has been the absolute best for pain relief. I\u2019ve used it for years. Instead of trying to drive around to see which store carries it, Amazon has made it easy. I\u2019ve tried other things that are too greasy, sticky, or just don\u2019t work. This stuff relieves the pain, smells nice, and it turns to tan rather quickly, skipping the peeling part. I swear by this stuff. \" \u2014 Danielle K. Schmidt Get it from Amazon for $10.03 . 4. The Pink Stuff , a reviewer-loved product so good, you'll be tempted to part ways with every other cleaning product you own. Seriously, this amazing stuff can be used on a plethora of household items and surfaces (both indoors and outdoors). www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com It shouldn't be used on plastic or acrylic surfaces, highly polished stainless steel, or hot/warm surfaces. Plus, this is vegan! Promising review: \"I had tried everything to get the hardware stains off my shower. CLR, metal scrubbing pads, vinegar, and many other things. I thought I'd end up having to replace all the faucets. I saw this in a BuzzFeed article and thought, no way it's THAT good... It's that good. It's better than good. It's wild how good it is. My shower looks better than new. It took rust stains off the tile. It took years of hard water scale buildup off in seconds. It is literally a miracle product.\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $5.97 (also available in a pack of two). 5. A snout soother stick for pups whose noses need a little extra love. Simply swipe this onto their dry, chapped nose to help restore softness and hydration so they can go back to sniffing all that fresh springtime grass outside. www.amazon.com This snout soother is organic, vegan, and made with all-natural ingredients! Promising review: \"Well, I have never before been so shocked at the effectiveness of a product. Our 5-year-old Frenchie, Carol, had a nose that was so crusty it was sprouting these long strands of more crust. There was literally crust on crust on crust. The nose had strings of crust. This nose was so crusty and repulsive that it was almost beautiful. Her nose might have resembled the rarest, most exotic geode to be mined from the rarest mine in Guatemala. A friend recommended this snout soother for Carol's repulsive nose. I was worried she would just lick it all off, and it wouldn't work. We never imagined she could have a regular, soft, moist nose again. Unbelievable results in three to five days. No one paid me to write this.\" \u2014 Brittany Get it from Amazon for $6.49 (available in various sizes and pack options). 6. A callus-removal gel so you can experience the baby-soft feet you not only want but truly deserve. Sure, you could just go to the salon and get a pedicure, but when this entire bottle costs a fraction of the price of ONE pedi...well, it's a no-brainer, isn't it? Not to mention, you can stay home and wear your pajamas. A win-win. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Just presoak your feet, apply the gel, let sit for 5\u201310 minutes, and rinse!

I read a lot of the reviews before purchasing this product. Most callus removers I have purchased in the past were not very effective. So, I was encouraged by the reviews.

I\u2019ve used whitening strips before, but those usually hurt my sensitive teeth, and I hate the taste of some of the other gels on the market, but this one was super easy and didn\u2019t hurt my teeth at all and didn\u2019t taste much different than my regular toothpaste, since I got the mint-flavored one. I used it for a few weeks before my brother\u2019s wedding, and it worked like a charm. I noticed visible results in only a couple of days and was able to keep using it until I reached my desired shade of white. 10/10 would recommend for anyone with sensitive teeth and taste s!\" \u2014 Victoria Bravo Get a two-pack from Amazon for $18.95 . 8.

I know, I know, I'm crying tears of joy, too. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have well water. Something in my well water reacts with copper plumbing and turns my shower tiles blue. Since my bathroom color scheme isn't on the blue spectrum, this is problematic. The well water also causes the shower glass to film up quickly. I've tried dozens and dozens of cleaners and scrubbed \u2019til my arms ached, trying to get ahead of the blue and scumminess . My ambition in life is NOT to be a full-time bathroom scrubber! I saw this stuff on a professional house cleaner's TikTok (sorry, I don't remember which one) and thought, 'What the heck, might as well give it a try.' Oh my goodness, the first day after my shower, I sprayed this stuff all over and walked away. The next morning, there was a NOTICEABLE reduction in the blue, and the glass looked clearer, too. On day two, I sprayed again and walked away. The next morning, the blue was gone except for a few spots on the floor tile, and the glass looked amazing. On day three, I sprayed the remaining spots, and the next morning, the shower practically looked new. NO SCRUBBING AT ALL!!!! This is my new favorite shower cleaner. The ONLY con I have is that it makes me sneeze while I'm spraying from inside the shower, but I can live with that.\" \u2014 L. J.

I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and just not getting clean. Then, I became aware that the water softener was no longer doing its job, so I had the rental company replace it. Dishwasher performance improved somewhat. I decided to do two more loads before deciding to purchase a new one. Then, I saw a product test review for Affresh in a magazine. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway, so I added that to my order. When it came, I tossed one of the tablets into the bottom of the full machine and ran the regular cycle. I did not expect the results I got! My glassware, which I thought was permanently etched and ruined, came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I will use this faithfully on a monthly basis, as recommended. I can even put it on my subscribe and save order, so I will get a new pack every six months.

My skin NEVER felt smooth, even with the prescriptions I was given to help with these tiny bumps. Rosacea = bad, bad, bad. So bad that it was actually causing my cheeks to have what appeared to be thickening skin. Wrinkles, some that were quite deep.

I have severe rosacea that leaves my nose and cheeks dry, flaky, and breaking out. I\u2019ve had little success with anything topical that will relieve my irritated skin. My sister recommended it to me when I was looking for a moisturizer after a severe sunburn that left my nose blistered and raw. I received my order Wednesday and applied it that night after washing my face. By Saturday afternoon, my face was almost completely healed, preventing pealing, and helped clear up my rosacea skin irritation! I\u2019m completely amazed! I\u2019ve applied less than a dime size over my face four times! My skin has truly never felt better! It\u2019s got to be witchcraft because not even the different prescriptions I\u2019ve tried over the years have produced these results.\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $20.83+ (available in two sizes).

I was unable to get the battery to charge at anything above 64W. I also tried using an USBC soldering iron that's supposed to have a max power usage of 100W and the battery was only outputting 64W max. So even though it says that it can output 145W and can charge at 100W, I was only ever able to get 64W. Do note that all these tests were done at 30% charge. So that might have something to do but I'll try some more tests once it charges to 100% Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link 1 Reply Sign up for a Slickdeals account to remove this ad.

When you go to check out, it also pro rates the total price to be split between the two items, which is also how much gets refunded if you try to return one or the other. Just FYI for those who are wondering why the price goes up when you add the free item, and looks completely off when you check out. And as the other poster said, the eligible items is the \"buy one\" part, you have to click the \"benefit item\" tab/filter to show the free item.

So that might have something to do but I'll try some more tests once it charges to 100% There must be something wrong with your unit or the power negotiation. Mine charges at 65W (as rated) and outputs 100W on USB-C port 1 or USB-C port 2 (as rated). As soon as you use the USB-A ports, the power division does have more step down options, so I don't use them when charging laptops. 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link rainmanx2 Yesterday Apr 19, 2025 3:01 AM 433 Posts Joined Dec 2015 Yesterday Apr 19, 2025 3:01 AM rainmanx2 Yesterday Apr 19, 2025 3:01 AM 433 Posts Does this come with one or two free items?

By: Mike Beiermeister Posted and last updated BROWN DEER, Wis. \u2014 Natasha McCants smiles easily these days, but that wasn't always the case. The past two years have tested her in ways she never imagined after a cancer diagnosis changed everything. \"It was very hard. Very, very hard. It was not an easy road to get to where I'm at now,\" McCants said. In February 2023, at just 45 years old, McCants received devastating news: she had colon cancer, despite having no prior symptoms. \"My first thought is, I have two children, and who needs their mother. So it was fear,\" McCants said. Over the next two years, McCants endured surgery and months of chemotherapy. But her condition worsened, and doctors eventually advanced her diagnosis to stage four after discovering cancer had spread to her lungs and liver. \"They sent me home to die. They said there's nothing else we can do,\" McCants said. Refusing to give up, McCants and her family advocated for a second opinion, which led her to Chief of Medical Oncology Dr. Ajaz Khan, M.D. at City of Hope in Illinois, about an hour away from her home. City of Hope Dr. Ajaz Khan, M.D. The new medical team brought fresh perspective and different treatment options. \"Her DNA tells so much in terms of where the cancer's growing. She has a marker which we can easily treat,\" Dr. Khan said. Now, most of McCants' cancer is gone. Dr. Khan believes that with one final surgery scheduled in less than two weeks, she could be rendered disease-free.

When asked if skipping a wellness check might have cost her life, McCants replied, \"I probably would not have been here.\" Her experience has given her a new outlook on life, and she encourages everyone to prioritize their health and never surrender hope. Mike Beiermeister Natasha McCants \"You have one body, and you have to take care of it,\" McCants said. She credits her faith family as well for uplifting her through prayer like at St. Philip's Evangelical Lutheran Church with Pastor Raymond Kimbrough, Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church, Christian Faith Fellowship Church, Tabernacle Community Baptist Church, and Holy Redeemer Church of God and Christ.

Legendary, which produced Pacific Rim, is also backing the series alongside Amazon MGM. The studio appears to be using the same strategy with Pacific Rim that worked with its Godzilla-and-King-Kong-starring \"MonsterVerse\" franchise. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters streamed on Apple TV+ in 2023, and acted as both a prequel and sequel to the \"MonsterVerse\" films. back Go To Full Article No comments available.

The first one is a full size SD card. You'll need a micro SD card but you're better off with an endurance micro SD card for DashCam. saiya78 on 19/04/2025 - 20:35 Thanks. Almost buy this then realize this is not for the dashcam size. kaikor on 19/04/2025 - 13:58 Is this good as a 2nd storage for Macbook Pro SD slot sticking there permanently? Mnke on 19/04/2025 - 14:07 +1 Too slow. Better off with a portable m.2 enclosure with a nvme SSD of your choice over USB C. If you must have a SD card, have a look at the Transcend JetDrive lite that sits flush in the slot. Oisinmc95 on 19/04/2025 - 14:58 Anyone know if the microSD is any good for a GoPro? jsediv on 19/04/2025 - 15:01 Yep thats one of the fastest MicroSD cards you can get. More than capable for use with a GoPro Andy01 on 19/04/2025 - 17:56 It depends how long you want to record for and what your resolution settings are. On my Osmo Action 3 at 4K/60 I get about 4.5 hours on a 256Gb card, so this 128Gb would be around 2\u00bc hours. I also seem to remember seeing something about the 128Gb versions having compatibility issues with OA - not sure about GoPro ? sav11 on 19/04/2025 - 15:34 Is the MicroSD good to replace the one that comes with the Trimui Smart Pro - retro handheld gaming device? Sandman88 on 19/04/2025 - 18:19 +1 I've just ordered one for my Steam Deck, looks good from my research. Ironic fear on 19/04/2025 - 21:06 +1 Yep, ive got this for the smartpro and the samsung endurance for my rp4.

Another benefit of UASP is that it reduces the processor resources required by traditional USB when transferring data.

None of these allow that, you have to directly install into computer to do that. The fastest trick is to get a cheap $5-10 pci-e to m.2 adapter card to easily swap into a computer.

This week, the trial began in a suit by the FTC claiming that Meta, formerly Facebook, cemented an illegal monopoly in social media through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Reuters Silicon Valley's tech giants have long regarded antitrust scrutiny as an irritating cost of doing business. There will be investigations, filings, depositions and even lawsuits. Yet courts move slowly, while technology rushes ahead. Time works to the companies' advantage, as the political winds shift and presidential administrations change. That dynamic often opens the door to light-touch settlements. But the stakes rose sharply for Google on Thursday, when a federal judge ruled that the company had acted to illegally to build a monopoly in some of its online advertising technology. In August, another federal judge found that Google had engaged in anticompetitive behavior to protect its monopoly in online search. Antitrust experts said two big antitrust wins for the government against a single company in such a short time appeared to have no precedent. \"Two courts have reached similar conclusions in product markets that go to the heart of Google's business,\" said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and former chair of the Federal Trade Commission. \"That has to be seen as a real threat.\" Live Events The Google decisions are part of a wave of current antitrust cases challenging the power of the biggest tech companies. This week, the trial began in a suit by the FTC claiming that Meta , formerly Facebook, cemented an illegal monopoly in social media through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories The government has also sued Apple and Amazon over allegations of anticompetitive behavior. And on Monday, the judge who ruled against Google in August will hear arguments on how to restore competition in the online search engine market. The Justice Department has asked the court to order Google to sell Chrome, its popular web browser, and either spin off Android, its smartphone operating system, or be barred from making its services mandatory on its phones. Google has described the government's request as a \"wildly overboard proposal\" that \"goes miles beyond the court's decision.\" The company suggested that it should change very little. In the ad technology case, the judge gave both sides seven days to propose a schedule for the next phase of the case, which will also involve remedies. The government is likely to ask Google to sell some of its ad tools, the antitrust experts said. Antitrust enforcement has taken an activist turn in recent years, as both the Trump and Biden administrations increased their scrutiny of the biggest tech companies. But filing cases by no means guarantees success. The triumphs by the government in both Google cases, the experts said, signal that the courts are finally grappling with anticompetitive behavior in digital markets. For years, enforcement lagged technology's explosive growth, in part because antitrust law typically focuses on rising prices for consumers. Many internet services are free. The Justice Department's wins against Google are \"important affirmations of the ability of the government to pursue major monopolization cases and prevail -- something there has been doubt about,\" said Nancy Rose, an economist who is an antitrust expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The goal of an antitrust remedy is to free up markets, creating a competitive environment that results in more new ideas, new companies, more innovation and lower prices. The courts have long been reluctant to engage in the drastic surgery of a breakup. In the last major antitrust case against a tech company, the government reached a settlement with Microsoft in 2001, shortly after the George W. Bush administration assumed office. The agreement loosened up Microsoft's contracts on personal computer software, which a court found to be anticompetitive, but left the company intact. While the judges in the Google case will weigh breakup options again, the prospects are uncertain. Shifts in the political climate could also influence the outcome for Google, as they did for Microsoft. So far, aggressive antitrust enforcement has had bipartisan support. The Google search case was filed in the waning days of the first Trump administration, and the ad technology case by the Biden administration. \"It's pretty amazing when you look at the cases filed, the progress so far, and that the government enforcers seem consistently serious,\" said Harry First, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. \"Maybe the tortoise is going to win here.\" Still, the Google rulings are early steps in an uncertain judicial process. Google will appeal both, and has expressed confidence that it will ultimately prevail. The company contends that its strong market position in search and ad technology is the result of innovation and investment -- superior products that consumers value -- and not because of anticompetitive tactics. Either or both of the Google cases may land before the Supreme Court, the experts said. Or the Trump administration could settle them. \"Trump is a deal maker, and that could be where this is headed,\" said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Carey Law School.

I get your point but that would be incorrect as the main mantra here is for deals , not frugality, otherwise there wouldn't be deals here for let's say, $1,200 items at $900, a frugal person won't be buying anything of the sort as being frugal means having a mindset of minimizing unnecessary spending.

I think you have a different idea of what \"frugal\" means than me. Google \"frugal definition\" and it mentions nothing about \"unnecessary spending\". But arguing the meaning and definition of words is a useless endeavor. I think it's clear what I meant by \"frugal\" and I didn't mean only buy the absolute essentials. I've never heard of frugal being defined that way. 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link speroner Yesterday Apr 19, 2025 8:48 PM 510 Posts Joined Aug 2017 Yesterday Apr 19, 2025 8:48 PM speroner Yesterday Apr 19, 2025 8:48 PM 510 Posts So I buy these little cans all the time, especially from Aldi.. The pricing is similar to what you can get at Aldi, but I purchased these a little while back and these taste fantastic. Even though it's pretty much the same ingredients you'd get anywhere else. This has a distinctly non-metallic taste to it. With other canned tomato sauce there is a bit of a metallic taste, but not with these.. At least in my experience.. I actually drink these straight from the can sometimes. 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Related Searches Grocery Soups, Sauces, Packaged Meals & Canned Goods Free Shipping with Prime Online Only Amazon Fresh Amazon $4.95 $15 67% off 10\" Just Play Disney Scented Key Lime Munchlings Alien Plush Toy $4.95 + Free Shipping w/ Prime or on $35+ 6 There is no voting data on this thread You have chosen to downvote this deal.

I can't imagine chopping onions or bell peppers by hand anymore, and it does so much more.

Seriously. I have had tweezers and sticks and plumbers and chemicals trying to get my master sink to drain. Plumber even said I need an entirely new faucet to get the drain plug part because they don't sell those separately. Well, I have two sinks, a tub, and a shower that all match, so that was not a valid solution. Doubt I can find the same model. So I bought this thing. Stuffed it down, pulled up hair, and black muck. Did it about eight times quickly, ran the water, went right down the drain. Seriously. This is the best tool ever and the best $12 I have ever spent. Everyone with a sink needs this tool.

I've been trying to clear the drain with a different sink plunger that I already had, and it didn't do diddly-squat. I was about to give up and call a plumber. Then I decided to order this one, and it just arrived...it completely cleared the drain in like three minutes.

Emma Lord / BuzzFeed BuzzFeed Shopping editor Emma Lord has had major success with these: \"HELLO, I AM OBSESSED WITH THESE. Despite all the rave reviews, I was definitely skeptical of space-saving bags that didn't require a vacuum, and even as they were actively squishing my clothes into oblivion, I still couldn't quite believe it. I had easily two suitcases worth of clothes I wanted to pack for a three-week trip to London, and I managed to neatly pack the entirety of my wardrobe in one roller carry-on bag. Truly, all I had to do was put my clothes in the bag, push them to the bottom, and then sit on it to get the air out before sealing it up. I had tons of extra bags and made a habit of taking them with me in case other people joining me on trips needed them to be able to pack souvenirs on the way home.

I think the intuitive, easy-to-use design is fantastic. We already have the muscle memory for using a spray can. In an emergency, it's so much easier to grab this and use it and turn a small fire into a non-fire. I don't have time to remember a three-step method of fire control when my bacon has gotten out of control on the stove. I'm not a firefighter! I'd really like to have one in every room.

It had the reach, the hardware, the data, the closed loop ecosystem, it had everything but the need. Now, that\u2019s starting to change. Apple\u2019s quiet rebrand of its search ads business to the more assertive \u201cApple Ads\u201d may seem like a modest semantic update but in the context of platform power plays, language rarely shifts without intention. The move suggests that Apple is no longer content to just collect rent from the ad tech ecosystem it reshaped through privacy policies. It wants a larger piece of the action. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the rebrand of Apple Search Ads to Apple Ads is simply cosmetic,\u201d said Eric Seufert, independent analyst and investor. \u201cBut a renewed focus on advertising by Apple seems inescapable in light of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\u201d The timing matters. Apple has spent years building its defenses, designing its own chips, overhauling supply chains \u2014 but tariffs on Chinese imports, especially under Trump\u2019s return to the campaign trail, are reintroducing uncertainty. Some products have dodged the impact, others haven\u2019t. And with hardware margins already tight, Apple needs new ways to protect its bottom line. Advertising offers one. It scales quickly. It doesn\u2019t rely on manufacturing. And unlike raising prices on an iPhone, it\u2019s unlikely to provoke customer backlash or regulatory blowback. It\u2019s a high-margin business Apple can grow quickly, leveraging infrastructure it already owns. Apple has always wanted a piece of the ad pie Apple\u2019s interest in advertising isn\u2019t new. From the ill-fated launch of iAd in 2010 to the steady growth of its search business, to its increasingly aggressively dismantling of third-party tracking, Apple has never been indifferent to the ad economy. If anything, it\u2019s history shows a company intrigued by it but cautious about embracing it too directly. Through it all, Apple positioned itself as a privacy champion. That stance gave it both moral authority and regulator insulation even as it laid the groundwork to shape, and now profit from, the advertising industry on its own terms. To some, the new Apple Ads branding might look like a shift away from that ethos. But it\u2019s more likely a continuation of the strategy that\u2019s always defined the company: monetizing its principles on its own terms. \u201cLet\u2019s call it what it is: Apple\u2019s now in the ads business in earnest, and this rebrand lets them hide in plain sight. \u2018Apple Ads\u2019 sounds innocuous, even helpful,\u201d said Eric Shiffman, vp of product marketing at Yieldmo. \u201cBut it\u2019s a signal that a company famous for being the face of privacy is now capitalizing on proprietary signals no one else can access. It\u2019s privacy on their terms and monetization behind the curtain.\u201d For better or worse, marketers are ready for it. They\u2019ve spent years hoping Apple would emerge as a counterweight to Google, Meta and Amazon. But they also knew the pattern. A new player enters, promising control and opportunity, and before long, marketers find themselves locked inside another walled garden \u2014 this time with even less transparency into where their ads show up, how they perform or whether they\u2019re getting what they paid for. \u201cAs alluded to, healthy competition is welcome, but we have also seen Apple create and play by its own rules in its dominant app store ecosystem, where publishers and developers were at odds with Apple,\u201d said Sam Huston, vp of media at Dept. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll be closely following the dynamics and inner workings of the advertising marketplace\u2019s demand and supply sides.\u201d Timing is everything Even before tariffs had entered the conversation, Apple had been quietly laying the groundwork for a more aggressive advertising push. Seufert had unpacked much of this in detail on his Mobile Dev Memo blog but here are the CliffsNotes: last June, Apple renamed its attribution framework SKAdnetwork to the more expansive \u201cAdAttributionKit\u201d, signaling intent to support broader cross-device measurement. Then, Apple added view-through metric to its AdServices APP, functionality that hints at new inventory across non-clickable surfaces like podcasts, maps or even TV. That last point matters. Apple\u2019s struggles to build a sustainable streaming business are well-documented. Despite growing Apple TV subscriptions to 45 million last year, the unit is still losing over $1 billion annually. If nothing else, Netflix and Disney+ have shown that advertising can provide a path to offset content costs without needing to hike prices too high or churn too many subscribers. \u201cThe App Store aside, Apple\u2019s other big services like Music, TV+ and Arcade are all smaller players in their sectors so you wouldn\u2019t expect them to support a huge ads business even if ads were switched on,\u201d said Jamie MacEwan, senior research analyst at Enders Analysis. \u201cThere have been reports of Apple considering an ads tier on Apple TV+, one benefit might be to extend the reach of the product and maintain its market relevance while plugging some of the content spend deficit, but this would still be a tiny player in the context of the US or UK TV advertising markets.\u201d The numbers Last year, Apple\u2019s U.S. ad business totaled $6.47 billion, but only accounted for 2.1% of total digital ad spending, according to eMarketer\u2019s March 2025 forecast. While that percentage for total digital ad spend is expected to stay static at 2.1% through 2025 and 2026, eMarketer has still forecast that the tech giant will rake in $7.42 billion this year (14.7% increase on 2024\u2019s revenue), and $8.21 billion in 2026 (with only a 10.6% increase on 2025\u2019s revenue achievements).

But there are clouds on the horizon. What\u2019s clear from the 2024 WWD Beauty Inc Top 100, our annual ranking of the world\u2019s largest beauty companies by sales, is that the industry is undergoing seismic shifts as a result of geopolitical tensions, technological advances and a consumer landscape that is more complex than ever before. The good news is that total sales hit $252.09 billion. But that represented an increase of just 2.8 percent year-over-year, almost half that of 2023\u2019s 5.3 percent gain. The ongoing slowdown in China weighed heavily on sales, and corporate restructuring was in the cards for a number of players as they sought to derisk and home in on high-potential categories. L\u2019Or\u00e9al accounted for 18.7 percent of total sales, its share of the Top 100 inching up once more, by 0.5 percentage points year-over-year, up from 14.7 percent in 2019. The top 10 companies overall generated sales of $147.49 billion, or 58.5 percent of total Top 100 revenues, down 0.9 percentage points. Despite the year\u2019s challenges, the vast majority \u2014 73 percent \u2014 of companies saw their sales increase, but only 29 saw double-digit gains, down from 37 a year earlier, a sign of slower growth on the market overall. Of the 17 players with negative sales progression, seven were down more than 10 percent and three posted declines of more than 20 percent. Among the biggest winners: Spain\u2019s Puig entered the top 10 for the first time, up four places on a year ago, driven by strong growth in fragrance and skin care. L\u2019Occitane, buoyed by the year\u2019s viral hit Sol de Janeiro, climbed two places to number 18. While times were tough for a number of C-beauty players, the biggest Chinese company on the list, Proya, jumped eight spots to number 28, the first C-beauty firm to reach the Top 30 global beauty companies. With social-savvy affordable makeup players still trending as consumers feel the pinch, despite weakness in mass overall, especially in the U.S., beauty got two new billionaire brands, with E.l.f Beauty and Cosnova both surpassing that milestone in dollar terms. This year\u2019s newcomers include D&G Beauty, which has seen its sales explode since it took its beauty license, previously held by Shiseido, back in-house; Chinese makeup artist brand Mao Geping, which went public in Hong Kong; Aur\u00e9a Group, the new owner seeking to turn around The Body Shop; Shein, which is flying high with in-house brand Sheglam, and AS Beauty, which bought Bliss World from L Catterton and has successfully rejuvenated the Laura Geller makeup brand. But it was a rough ride for beauty on the stock market in 2024. Of the 49 listed players tracked in our By the Numbers section, only 15 saw their share prices increase through the year, with Victoria\u2019s Secret & Co. the biggest gainer as the market reacted to its turnaround efforts. Of the 29 public players whose share value fell, 21 were down in the double digits, and five of the biggest decliners \u2014 Nu Skin Enterprises, Yunnan Botanee, Olaplex, The Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos. and Shiseido \u2014 were already on the wane a year ago, with their market value falling further in 2024. Compiling the Top 100 The WWD Beauty Inc Top 100 ranks the world\u2019s largest beauty manufacturers. Firms are arranged by their beauty sales for the 2024 calendar year. For those companies whose fiscal year did not run from Jan. 1, 2024, to Dec. 31, 2024, estimates were calculated. All sales figures were either obtained from the companies or generated with the help of industry sources, indicated by (EST.) in the ranking. For this list, \u201cbeauty\u201d includes fragrance , makeup, skin care, body care, sun care, hair care, deodorant, plus cellulite and shaving products. It does not include bar soaps, razors, toothpastes, food and diet foods, medicines, vitamins, detergents or appliances. The revenues only include sales of beauty products each firm owns or manufactures and do not include business from private-label lines produced for other brands or products distributed for other companies.

The company described the year as \u201ca tale of two halves,\u201d with a strong first six months followed by weakness in the latter part of the year due to the global slowdown and ongoing challenges in China. Had it not been for the North Asia region, its sales would have advanced in the high single digits, it said. Unilever London 2024 Beauty Sales: $26.63 Billion (EST.) \u20ac24.61 Billion (EST.) +1.8% VS. 2023 (EST.) The upheaval at Unilever continues. 2024 was a year dedicated to slimming down and streamlining its operating structure under CEO Hein Schumacher, who joined the company in July 2023 and implemented a major reset in October that year. The news this February that Schumacher would step down in March by mutual agreement took the market by surprise, particularly as he had been praised for his strategy, which the company has said is beginning to bear fruit. CFO Fernando Fernandez \u2014 Unilever\u2019s head of Beauty & Wellbeing until 2023 \u2014 was named CEO. The Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos. New York 2024 Beauty Sales: $15.2 Billion (EST.) FLAT VS. 2023 With a C-suite shuffle, thousands of layoffs, an Amazon U-turn and a disappearing outlook, it was a wild ride in 2024 for the Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos. Beginning with the C-suite, after months of speculation, the company announced during the summer that longtime CEO Fabrizio Freda would retire, setting off a succession race between then group executive president St\u00e9phane de La Faverie and chief data officer and executive vice president, enterprise marketing Jane Lauder, with the former eventually winning the title. Jane Lauder subsequently departed day-to-day operations to focus on her duties as a board member. Her cousin William Lauder followed suit, departing his role as executive chairman. This marks the first time in company history that a family member won\u2019t be involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm. Procter & Gamble Cincinnati 2024 Beauty Sales: $15 Billion (EST.) FLAT VS. 2023 (EST.) Continued economic and geo-political headwinds, particularly in China, weighed on results for Procter & Gamble\u2019s beauty activity last year. On an organic basis, the firm\u2019s beauty business delivered sales growth of 2%, with slight gains across most brands and geographies. LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton Paris 2024 Beauty Sales: $9.11 Billion (EST.) \u20ac8.42 Billion (EST.) +2% VS. 2023 LVMH attributed its slight growth in beauty once again to a combination of innovation and its selective retail strategy. As with its competitors, the ongoing slowdown in China appears to have weighed on growth, with Asia (outside Japan) shrinking its weight in the company\u2019s beauty business for the fifth year in a row, down to 30% last year, compared with 33% a year earlier and as much as 45% in 2020. Chanel Ltd. London 2024 Beauty Sales: $8.54 Billion (EST.) \u20ac7.89 Billion (EST.) +2.6% VS. 2023 With its fragrance business flat, Chanel\u2019s other beauty axes drove business, with makeup the main contributor to its slight uptick in estimated beauty revenues. Sales grew in all markets except the U.S., and Chanel\u2019s performance in travel retail was solid, recovering in most regions but remaining slightly below 2019 levels in North Asia. Beiersdorf Hamburg, Germany 2024 Beauty Sales: $8.53 Billion (EST.) \u20ac7.88 Billion (EST.) +4.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) It was another strong year for the skin care specialist, which CEO Vincent Warnery said was \u201cthe best performing skin care company globally\u201d for the second year in a row. Bolstered by strong business from Nivea and the ongoing growth of its Derma brands, especially Eucerin, the German company was on a roll. Shiseido Tokyo 2024 Beauty Sales: $6.55 Billion (EST.) \u00a5990.59 Billion (EST.) +1.8% VS. 2023 (EST.) While Shiseido\u2019s sales were relatively stable in 2024, boosted by an uptick on the domestic market, its operating profit tanked, falling 73.1% with the continuing deceleration in China and duty-free weighing heavily on its results. Coty Amsterdam 2024 Beauty Sales: $6.1 Billion (EST.) +1.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) The fragrance effect was alive and well at Coty in 2024, although its most recent set of earnings showed this was not enough to offset pressures from weak demand in Asia and tight inventory in the U.S. in the latter part of the calendar year, weighing on numbers. Puig Barcelona 2024 Beauty Sales: $4.79 Billion (EST.) \u20ac4.43 Billion (EST.) +12% VS. 2023 (EST.) It was a big year for Spain\u2019s Puig as it made its stock market debut, further bolstered its portfolio and celebrated its 110th anniversary and listing with a new visual identity. The company outperformed both the premium beauty market and its own midterm revenue guidance for the year, and growth was weighted strongly in the second half. Mary Kay Addison, TX 2024 Beauty Sales: $4.6 Billion (EST.) +7% VS. 2023 (EST.) The world\u2019s number-one direct seller of skin care and makeup, per Euromonitor data, Mary Kay broadened its reach to a younger audience with the launch of Mary Kay Skin Care, formulated for those not ready for age-defying products, composed of two regimens, Hydrating and Mattifying. Bath & Body Works Columbus, Ohio 2024 Beauty Sales: $4.58 Billion (EST.) +0.2% VS. 2023 (EST.) Bath & Body Works spent 2024 building momentum. It maintained market leadership and unit market share in the U.S. body care, home fragrance and soaps and sanitizers segments in 2024, and continued to drive growth in adjacent areas like men\u2019s, laundry, lip and hair care. Natura & Co. S\u00e3o Paulo 2024 Beauty Sales: $4.49 Billion (EST.) R$24.09 Billion (EST.) -24.4% VS. 2023 (EST.) It was another complex year for the Brazilian beauty heavyweight. Following the sale of A\u0113sop to L\u2019Or\u00e9al and the divestment of The Body Shop in 2023 as it sought to simplify its operations and reduce debt, Natura announced early in 2024 that it was looking at options to spin off Avon, whose operations it had acquired outside North America (that activity is owned by South Korea\u2019s LG H&H) in 2020. Henkel D\u00fcsseldorf 2024 Beauty Sales: $4.24 Billion (EST.) \u20ac3.92 Billion (EST.) +3.9% VS. 2023 (EST.) Henkel continued to rationalize its portfolio and boost the momentum behind its biggest brands and categories through 2024. It said the strategy, which has seen the company shed businesses in its Consumer Brands portfolio representing around \u20ac1 billion in revenues since 2022, is beginning to bear fruit, notably in the hair care category, where the rationalization is more advanced than in other segments. In beauty, following the 2023 disposal of skin care brand Diadermine, it quietly sold off natural skin care label N.A.E. to Katjes International last year. Kenvue Skillman, N.J. 2024 Beauty Sales: $4.2 Billion (EST.) -3% VS. 2023 (EST.) As Kenvue finds its footing out from under Johnson & Johnson and onto the public market, its skin care activity felt the impact of the declining mass market in the U.S. Kao Corp. Tokyo 2024 Beauty Sales: $4.14 Billion (EST.) \u00a5625.7 Billion (EST.) +5.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) As it sought to seize opportunities outside Asia and dynamize key brands, 2024 was a year of change for Kao as it continued to implement its \u201cGlobal Sharp Top\u201d strategy introduced in 2023. Colgate-Palmolive New York 2024 Beauty Sales: $3.6 Billion (EST.) -2.7% VS. 2023 (EST.) Sales slowed for Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s beauty activity last year, according to estimates. The company said it saw organic sales growth in liquid hand soaps and body wash, but declines in its skin health business, as well as for deodorants in North America. L\u2019Occitane International S.A. Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland 2024 Beauty Sales: $3.14 Billion (EST.) \u20ac2.9 Billion (EST.) +18.9% VS. 2023 (EST.) L\u2019Occitane\u2019s Sol de Janeiro brand was one of beauty\u2019s biggest newsmakers of the year with its explosive growth across geographies as young consumers flocked toward its affordable body sprays and core body care offering. Amorepacific Seoul 2024 Beauty Sales: $3.02 Billion (EST.) KRW 4.12 Trillion (EST.) +6.2% VS. 2023 (EST.) Amorepacific\u2019s turnaround efforts began to bear fruit last year, helped especially by strong growth outside Asia. Its revenues in the Americas surpassed those in Greater China for the first time in the group\u2019s history. The integration of sensitive skin care brand Cosrx starting in the second quarter contributed to growth, especially in the EMEA region. Laneige, Hera, Aestura, Illiyoon and Labo-H also performed well, with strong sales in multibrand retail and online. LG H&H Seoul 2024 Beauty Sales: $2.9 Billion (EST.) KRW 3.95 Trillion (EST.) +0.2% VS. 2023 (EST.) Despite ongoing tough conditions in China, travel retail and the domestic market, LG H&H returned to slight growth with its beauty activity in 2024. The company has been restructuring its operations to focus on agility and brand building and fostering closer collaboration between its domestic and international operations. Wella Company New York/Geneva 2024 Beauty Sales: $2.26 Billion (EST.) +3.3% VS. 2023 (EST.)

It also did well in the U.K. and Italy. Makeup continued to be a source of growth, with key launches including Lip Oil Balm. Once again, the firm\u2019s direct-to-consumer business outperformed sales to third-party sellers, which were up 3% like-for-like.

Beginning with the C-suite, after months of speculation, the company announced during the summer that longtime CEO Fabrizio Freda would retire, setting off a succession race between then group executive president St\u00e9phane de La Faverie and chief data officer and executive vice president, enterprise marketing Jane Lauder, with the former eventually winning the title. Jane Lauder subsequently departed day-to-day operations to focus on her duties as a board member. Her cousin William Lauder followed suit, departing his role as executive chairman. This marks the first time in company history that a family member won\u2019t be involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm. Other changes included Tracey T. Travis stepping down as CFO, replaced by Akhil Shrivastava. The changes continued into 2025 under de La Faverie\u2019s leadership, with Peter Jueptner, Est\u00e9e Lauder group president, international, leaving, followed by a plethora of moves to its international leadership.

The company\u2019s 24 brands will now be organized by category clusters reporting to Hudis, with the hope being that this will break down silos and accelerate speed-to-market innovations. Much of the leadership reshuffling involves the elevation of internal executives, many of whom had joined the company in the last few years. Last June, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle announced plans to leave his eponymous niche fragrance brand, Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle. As for the board, Ronald S. Lauder, a son of founder Est\u00e9e, retired and handed one of his seats to his son-in-law Eric Zinterhofer, who is married to Aerin Lauder. Most recently, the company expanded the number of layoffs it needs to make from the 3,000 announced in 2024 to as many as 7,000 as part of its Profit Recovery and Growth Plan. It was also reported that Lauder had hired consultancy Evercore to assess its current brand portfolio, with continued speculation that it could look at divestments. Throughout 2024, weak demand in China and Asia travel retail continued to weigh on Lauder, while cracks started to appear in its home market. As a result, the company pulled its full year 2025 outlook in October due to continued volatility and low visibility in the near term. As of press time, it had not issued a new one. While analysts believe some impactive factors are out of Lauder\u2019s control, de La Faverie is betting on his Beauty Reimagined strategy to \u201crestore sustainable sales growth and achieve a solid double-digit adjusted operating margin over the next few years,\u201d he said in a release. Key to his vision is expanding into high-growth channels, markets, media and price tiers to participate in key growth opportunities in prestige beauty. Over the last nine months, for example, key brands like Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and The Ordinary have launched on Amazon, while in Europe, the company is eager to leverage the strength of its skin care category in the pharmacy channel, for one. Per the company, the move to Amazon appears to have been so far successful. As for launches, Balmain debuted Les \u00c9ternels de Balmain, a collection of eight fragrances, produced under license by the Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos. Deciem, the incubator and parent company of The Ordinary \u2014 which closed its $1.7 billion deal with parent The Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos. in 2024 \u2014 debuted Loopha, a body care brand with two products, hand and body washes. Other key launches included La Mer Rejuvenating Night Cream and the rollout of Tom Ford Beauty\u2019s Runway Lip Color, with the help of its first ever celebrity face, Angelina Jolie. Also during 2024, Clinique made a philanthropic commitment of $5 million over seven years to establish the Mount Sinai-Clinique Healthy Skin Dermatology Centre with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. It will study skin aging, skin allergies and inflammatory eczematous skin conditions.

Wow your guests (and your tastebuds!) by serving a gorgeous Grapefruit Ros\u00e9 Mimosas! Grapefruit juice and ros\u00e9 sparkling wine make for an excellent beverage for a holiday brunch, baby shower or a small gathering! Substitute sparkling grape juice for those who aren\u2019t having alcohol. It\u2019s days like today that I love my job. I just wrapped up my last recipe at noon and am done for the week! After working Sunday through Wednesday and blogging 5 recipes it feels good to pack it all away. It\u2019s been one of those whirlwind weeks, but nothing is better than finishing the workweek sipping on a mimosa. I\u2019ve never been so glad I planned an adult beverage as my last recipe to shoot, because right after I was finished taking the last photo, I sipped one (or two \ud83e\udd2b) of these gorgeous blush beauties. Best workday ever . So yay! It\u2019s spring and both Easter and Mother\u2019s Day is right around the corner. And these mims (literally just made that up) are just the thing! Ros\u00e9 sparkling wine with a splash of grapefruit juice. A light, tart and fizzy beverage. And oh so pretty! This drink really is so ridiculously simple. SO simple intact, that I can admit it doesn\u2019t really need an entire recipe or a blog post really because it\u2019s all of 2 maybe 3 ingredients, if you include the garnish. It definitely doesn\u2019t require all the photos that you\u2019ll scroll through to get to the recipe. But I love pretty drinks and taking photos of pretty drinks and well, I just hope you do too! To Make These Grapefruit Mimosas You Will Need: chilled ros\u00e9 sparkling wine or ros\u00e9 champagne chilled grapefruit juice cute bamboo skewers (linked in the printable recipe the end of this post.\ud83d\ude09) wedges fresh grapefruit for garnish Note: if using flowers, make sure they are edible and non-poisonous. Next, depending on the glasses you\u2019re using, pour in 1 to 2 ounces of ros\u00e9. Then finally top off each glass with chilled grapefruit juice. Check to make sure your juice doesn\u2019t have pulp. Because mine did, so I strained it beforehand. SO pretty! Can we just talk about this color for a moment? Because I want-slash-need more of it in my life. #pantonecoloroftheyear2019 #justsaying Lastly, skewer small wedges of grapefruit with bamboo picks and serve. Isn\u2019t the color absolutely gorgeous? I\u2019m so in love. These grapefruit ros\u00e9 mimosas are both refreshingly sweet and tart with a little punch because of the fizzy sparkling wine. The color is gorgeous and perfect for spring. Looking for more of a classic mimosa? Click here for my Classic Mimosa Recipe ! Enjoy! And if you give this Grapefruit Mimosa recipe a try, let me know!

Log In Sign Up Top Comments lshnaider Disadvantages 1. Effectiveness Against Mosquitoes Bug zappers, including the BLACK+DECKER models, are generally less effective against mosquitoes than advertised. Studies and expert reviews indicate that these devices tend to kill a broad range of insects\u2014mostly non-biting and beneficial species\u2014while only a small fraction of the catch are mosquitoes. Multiple users and experts note that zappers attract and kill more moths and other harmless insects than actual mosquitoes. 2. Environmental Impact The indiscriminate killing of insects can disrupt local ecosystems by eliminating pollinators and natural pest predators. This is a significant concern raised by entomologists and environmental experts. 3. Maintenance The zapper requires regular cleaning, as dead insects can quickly accumulate on the grid. Some users find this process inconvenient and note that cleaning could be easier. 4. Build Quality and Reliability Reviews are mixed regarding build quality. Some users report satisfaction with its durability, while others mention malfunctions or breakdowns shortly after purchase7. Issues with power source compatibility, such as circuit breakers tripping or bulbs failing, have also been reported. 5. Health and Safety Concerns When insects are electrocuted, their body parts can be dispersed into the air, potentially spreading bacteria or allergens. This is especially a concern if the zapper is placed near food preparation or dining areas. 6. Attracting More Pests Bug zappers can attract pests that might not have otherwise been drawn to your area, potentially increasing the presence of unwanted insects. 20 Comments Oldest Sign up for a Slickdeals account to remove this ad.

Mosquitos are very local. If you see a lot of them in your backyard, they likely came out of a puddle nearby. The only thing that works for us in the summer is to be super disciplined about avoiding any standing water around the house and then placing a few small water containers with mosquito dunks around the property. It's basically a bio weapon that only kills mosquito larvae. You will need to check on those frequently and replace the dunks monthly. It's a bit of effort but I think it works and it doesn't affect the beneficial insects 2 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link 1 Reply supersizedkid Yesterday Apr 18, 2025 4:50 AM 979 Posts Joined Jun 2008 Yesterday Apr 18, 2025 4:50 AM supersizedkid Yesterday Apr 18, 2025 4:50 AM 979 Posts Quote from huge : How do you kill mosquitos?

Promising review: \"Love that you can dress this up or down! It is my go-to accessory for working in preschool to put my hair up quickly . It is elegant and classic. It is amazingly durable even in getting thrown in the bottom of my heavy work bag! I am amazed by this clip. I have coarse medium thick hair and it is the perfect size.\" \u2014 Niki Get it from Amazon for $7.99 . 2. A dreamy dimmable candle-warmer lamp so you can waft your favorite candles throughout your space in the most aesthetically pleasing (and safe!) way possible. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought this on a whim, and I\u2019m hooked. I love the timer and dimmer features. So far, the lamp works great. It doesn\u2019t put out a lot of heat, and I love that you can adjust the light. This is now going to be my go-to gift. \" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $29.98 (available in 11 styles). 3. A pair of wireless over-the-ear headphones crafted to look like AirPods Max, so you can still enjoy the comfort and chic style of their iconic headphones without shelling out hundreds of dollars.

Thanks TikTok, lol :).\" \u2014 Chevelle Revero Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in five colors). 4.

Wayfair Promising review : \"Bought this to put under my window looking out into the backyard into the trees. It\u2019s lovely. Very sturdy. I got the beige, the material is great. It was packaged in one piece. Finally had something I didn\u2019t have to put together, lol \u2014 that was nice. Went to my niece's home in another state and she had one in a different color in her entryway. She used it as a seat to put on shoes and take off shoes when entering her home.

Love the colors. Wish they were available in one color only, but I can\u2019t complain. I primarily bought these for microwave purposes.

Obsessed with this!!! The fit is interesting \u2014 I got a medium as suggested for an oversize fit, but honestly I think a large would have been better for me.

Many dentists recommend waxed floss as a safer and more effective alternative to Teflon floss. Quote from SAN_MARINO : Thanks! Which brand do you recommend for waxed floss? Its a matter of personal preference. Some people prefer unwaxed floss which seems to pickup food particles better and can get between tight spaces better, but if your teeth are close together, unwaxed floss tends to break and fray along the edges. Waxed floss on the other hand tends to glide between the teeth easier and is less likely to get stuck between teeth or get caught on rough edges. It doesn't fray or break as easily as unwaxed floss either, but unwaxed floss is a little thicker, so if your teeth are close together, you might find it to be too thick and may prefer to use unwaxed floss. If you have widely spaced teeth, you could try tape floss/dental tape. It's thicker and broader than conventional dental floss and doesn't easily fray or break. I'm personally still sampling and haven't settled on a favorite brand. The main things for me is that it's PFA/PTFE free. A couple of considerations: - Reach is popular brand that's PFA-free. - Dr Tungs Smart Floss is also popular, but on the thicker side. I haven't tried this one yet.

Sucks I've used for over a decade Yup, same experience. These used to be thin and smooth, yet strong. Now it's fatter and rounder, yet somehow weaker. I broke about 4 per flossing before I threw them out. I moved to GUM comfort slide. They aren't as good as the old Glide, but close, and way better than the current Glide.

Google faces rulings over ad tech and Chrome, while Meta defends its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. DOJ and FTC lawsuits against Amazon and Apple proceed. Despite deregulation hopes, Trump's appointees vow strong enforcement, especially in AI, mergers, and content moderation by social platforms. Agencies The Trump administration isn't letting up on the tech giants. On Thursday, a federal judge ruled that Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in some online advertising technology. And on Monday, the Justice Department will argue that a federal judge should separately force Google to sell its Chrome web browser as it kicks off a three-week hearing about how to address the company's search monopoly. All this comes as the Federal Trade Commission opened a roughly three-month courtroom trial this week against Meta over claims that the social media giant snuffed out nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. Many of these cases, which helped set into motion a new era of antitrust scrutiny, were filed during President Donald Trump's first term in office. They were advanced by the Biden administration, which also filed monopoly lawsuits against Amazon, Apple and Google's ad technology business. Investors in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street hoped that Trump might show technology companies more deference during his second term, as he promised to deregulate industries. Some legal experts think the administration could still take a lighter hand on blocking mergers and set fewer proactive regulations for tech. Live Events But so far, Trump's appointees have promised to continue much of the scrutiny of the biggest tech companies, despite the industry's hopes. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories \"I think that they may not have fully focused on how much the first Trump presidency had to do with setting in motion this reexamination of tech ,\" said Bill Kovacic, a former FTC chair. Here's what to know. Who is in charge of antitrust enforcement now? Trump appointed Andrew Ferguson as chair of the FTC, which enforces antitrust and consumer protection laws. Ferguson, a lawyer who spent much of his career working for powerful Republican senators, has said he wants to increase scrutiny of the ways that social media companies decide to take posts down. Conservatives have complained for years that platforms like Facebook and YouTube disproportionately censor right-leaning viewpoints. \"I will throw every resource the agency has at prosecuting the cases against Big Tech that we've got going,\" Ferguson said in an appearance on the Bloomberg podcast \"Odd Lots\" this year. The new leader of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Gail Slater, a veteran tech and media lawyer, worked in the White House during Trump's first term. She has also pledged to enforce antitrust laws aggressively. \"It's now a bipartisan issue, and there's a consensus around the need for robust antitrust enforcement,\" Slater said at an event hosted this month by Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley startup accelerator, which has pushed for more antitrust scrutiny of the tech giants. Where do the major antitrust lawsuits against the tech giants stand? Five government cases accuse tech companies of maintaining illegal monopolies, and all are moving through the courts. The companies deny the allegations. -- The FTC sued Meta in 2020, arguing that its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 violated the law by using what regulators call a \"buy or bury\" strategy to eliminate its nascent rivals. The trial is expected to last into July and feature testimony from high-profile figures including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. -- The Justice Department sued Google in 2020 over claims that it had a monopoly in online search. A federal judge ruled for the government last year and will convene a three-week hearing on how to address Google's monopoly starting Monday. The government has suggested that the company sell Chrome, among other measures. Google has proposed fewer restrictions and has said it plans to appeal. -- The Justice Department accused Google in 2023 of illegally dominating the advertising technology business. A federal judge heard arguments in that case last year, and a ruling was issued Thursday. Google was found to have been a monopolist. -- The FTC accused Amazon in a 2023 lawsuit of squeezing small merchants that use its marketplace to sell to consumers. A federal judge rejected Amazon's attempt to dismiss the case last year. It is scheduled to go to trial next year. -- The Justice Department sued Apple last year over claims that the company's interwoven ecosystem of technology makes it hard for consumers to ditch their iPhones and iPads . Apple has asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. What about tech industry mergers and acquisitions? The Biden administration tried and failed to block numerous tech deals, including Meta's purchase of a small virtual reality startup, Within. The push to stop acquisitions outraged investors who back small companies that want to cash out by being acquired by a tech giant. Trump's appointees say they want to get out of the way of acquisitions that don't present a competitive problem. Slater has expressed an openness to companies' proposing settlements -- such as selling off similar assets -- which can help resolve concerns about deals. In late January, the Justice Department sued to block the business software company Hewlett Packard Enterprise from buying Juniper Networks, a networking firm, for $14 billion. It was the first lawsuit to challenge a tech deal in Trump's second term. During the first Trump administration, the Justice Department unsuccessfully challenged AT&T's purchase of Time Warner . What does this mean for the artificial intelligence race? Last year, the Justice Department and the FTC agreed to divide up responsibility for investigating whether the biggest players in artificial intelligence were violating antitrust laws. The Justice Department started investigating Nvidia , while the FTC took Microsoft and its partner, OpenAI. It is unclear whether those investigations will result in lawsuits. The Trump administration has promised to clear the way for American companies to develop AI, including rescinding a Biden-era executive order that put guardrails on the use of the technology. The administration has solicited the industry's input on how best to move forward with policy around the technology, an opening that companies and investors took to lobby for fewer rules. \"I think it is extremely important that we protect competition in the AI space, but I think it is equally important that the government not race to regulate AI,\" Ferguson said on Bloomberg TV in March.

Star Wars Celebration 2025 is in full swing over in Japan, and along with some of the big announcements about projects developing in a galaxy far, far away, there's also some great news for collectors itching to get their hands on the latest franchise merchandise. Advertisement Not too long ago, Hasbro announced the arrival of \"Star Wars\" Black Series action figures that finally brought in characters from \"Shadows of the Empire,\" the Expanded Universe multimedia story that took place between \"Empire Strikes Back\" and \"Return of the Jedi.\" The villainous Prince Xizor is debuting this year, along with new versions of Luke Skywalker in Imperial Guard gear and Princess Leia in her Boushh disguise . But the latest reveal is one that fans have been wanting for awhile. Dash Rendar, one of the beloved main characters from \"Shadows of the Empire,\" is finally getting his own \"Star Wars\" Black Series action figure. But that's not all, because \"The Bad Batch\" is adding another member of the special unit of Clone Troopers to the 3.75-inch Vintage Collection of action figures, with Crosshair finally joining his brother at arms Hunter on toy shelves. Advertisement /Film is proud to exclusively debut our first look at both of these new \"Star Wars\" action figures below! Shadows of the Empire's Dash Rendar joins the Star Wars Black Series line Hasbro Dash Rendar was once a promising cadet at the Imperial Academy before an unfortunate incident saw him expelled from the academy and his family banished from the Core Worlds by the Emperor himself. So the skilled pilot and shooter became a smuggler and a mercenary. Eventually, Rendar got caught up with the efforts of the Rebel Alliance, and ever since his debut in \"Shadows of the Empire,\" he's been a fan favorite, with many hoping that he will properly be brought back into \"Star Wars\" canon in a major way ( just like Prince Xizor ). Perhaps the debut of this figure will help that along. Advertisement Hasbro In the \"Star Wars\" Legends stories, which \"Shadows of the Empire\" has been relegated to, Rendar was hired by Lando Calrissian to help track down Han Solo, after he was frozen in carbonite and taken by Boba Fett in \"Empire Strikes Back.\" He was also entrusted by Princess Leia to keep Luke Skywalker safe after an attempt on his life, and he even saved the young Jedi's life from a swoop gang on Tatooine. But sadly, when Rendar accompanied Luke on a mission to obtain the plans to the second Death Star, a mistake he made cost the lives of many Bothan pilots, giving some backstory to Mon Mothma's line about their sacrifice in \"Return of the Jedi.\" Habsro As for Dash Rendar's action figure, the Black Series brings him to life with incredible detail \u2014 almost to the point that he looks like \"Game of Thrones\" star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau \u2014 and he comes with a single blaster accessory. Advertisement Hasbro However, I must say, there's an ever so slight pang of disappointment in seeing that this figure does not come with the same heavy weapons pack that the original \"Shadows of the Empire\" action figure from Kenner came with. That figure included an assault rifle that was attached to a backpack that fit on Rendar's body, and it would have been cool to see that brought to life for the Black Series, even if it would likely be a bit impractical and cumbersome. Dash Rendar's Black Series action figure will be available for pre-order for $24.99 at 3pm ET on April 18 at Hasbro Pulse , Amazon , and Fan Channel retailers, and it will ship sometime this summer. The Bad Batch's Crosshair takes aim in the Star Wars Vintage Collection Hasbro Having a six-inch, details version of Dash Rendar is incredibly cool, and we can only hope that maybe his signature Outrider starship will someday get a toy revival as well, even if it's only in the Vintage Collection. Speaking of which... Advertisement While \"Star Wars: The Bad Batch\" has fully arrived in the Black Series, the Vintage Collection of 3.75-inch action figures is still catching up. So far, Hunter is the only member of Clone Force 99 to join the smaller action figure line, though the likes of Clone Captains like Rex, Grey, Ballast, and Howzer have been given the Vintage Collection treatment. Hasbro That's why we're happy to see the sniper known as Crosshair joining the ranks, and he comes with all the right accessories for battle. Along with his trusty sniper rifle, he comes with a smaller blaster, his trademark helmet (which is actually a full interchangeable head), and a removable backpack. Hasbro Sadly, as \"Star Wars\" fans know, Crosshair ultimately stays loyal to the Empire, and he's tasked by Grand Moff Tarkin to hunt down the Bad Batch on several occasions. Of course, he would eventually come to see the cruelty of the Empire and kill his commanding officer, which landed him in prison, and he would eventually (begrudgingly) be accepted back into the Clone Force 99 . Advertisement Hasbro Now, Crosshair can join the Vintage Collection, with pre-orders for $16.99 open on April 18 at 3pm ET on Hasbro Pulse , Amazon , and participating retailers, and he will be shipped sometime this summer.

R&D Marketing: Sell the Future Before It\u2019s Finished Marketing The art of turning prototypes, concepts, and emerging tech into stories that captivate early adopters, attract investors, and position your brand as a leader long before launch. Sumarie Engelbrecht Apr 17, 2025 Share this with a friend What is R&D Marketing? The Evolving Relationship Between Marketing and R&D Lessons from Amazon: From Fire Phone to Alexa Coca-Cola and Community Feedback in R&D The Role of Community Platforms in Product Innovation Using Data Platforms to Connect Dots Between Marketing and R&D How Generative AI Enhances R&D Marketing From Feedback to Product Strategy A Community-Driven Approach to Product Roadmapping Metrics That Matter in R&D Marketing Get Started What is R&D Marketing? R&D marketing refers to the process of incorporating marketing data, user insights, and community feedback into research and development. It's about building not just what is technically possible\u2014but what the market actually wants. Historically, R&D operated independently of marketing, leading to feature-rich products that sometimes missed the mark with real users. Today, brands are shifting toward a more integrated model , where customer behavior and sentiment data feed directly into product decisions. This shift is especially powerful in tech, where platforms, features, and services need to evolve continuously to stay competitive. R&D Is No Longer Just for Tech Giants For decades, R&D was viewed as the domain of tech titans and pharmaceutical giants. But that perception is changing\u2014and fast. The rise of no-code platforms , AI tools , community-based feedback loops , and digital experimentation environments has made innovation accessible to businesses without billion-dollar budgets. In fact, some of today\u2019s most disruptive innovations are coming from lean startups and agile mid-size brands who use real-time customer data to shape products and features at unprecedented speed. R&D is no longer just about long-term, secretive science\u2014it\u2019s about learning quickly, failing fast, and building what matters most . Why R&D Is Crucial in a Hyper-Competitive Market The business landscape is getting faster, noisier, and more customer-driven . Investing in R&D helps your company: Identify unmet needs before your competitors do Test ideas early , reducing the risk of market failure Adapt quickly to changes in consumer behavior or technology Unlock new value streams , from digital features to AI integrations Boost customer loyalty by responding to feedback with meaningful innovation According to a PwC Global Innovation 1000 study, companies that integrate R&D with business strategy outperform their peers in growth, profitability, and longevity . The Evolving Relationship Between Marketing and R&D The relationship between marketing and R&D has undergone a massive shift. Once viewed as separate disciplines\u2014one creative, one technical\u2014they're now increasingly interdependent . Why this matters: Faster time-to-market through early validation of ideas. More relevant features that align with real user needs. Smarter positioning based on market feedback. This collaboration is being supported by advancements in AI, behavioral analytics, and real-time feedback platforms that bring customer insight to the forefront of product design. Take Glossier , for example. What started as a beauty blog grew into a billion-dollar brand largely through community-driven R&D . By listening closely to customer feedback and engaging users in product discussions, Glossier was able to develop high-demand products with minimal waste \u2014turning its audience into a living R&D lab. Similarly, Allbirds used eco-conscious materials and user feedback to build a unique product category\u2014sustainable, stylish footwear\u2014at a time when larger brands hadn\u2019t noticed the niche. These examples prove that you don\u2019t need a giant lab\u2014you need a strong listening strategy and a willingness to experiment. The ROI of R&D: It's Not Just About Products Investing in R&D isn\u2019t only about building new products. It\u2019s about strengthening your strategic agility \u2014your ability to anticipate shifts and respond faster than competitors. R&D drives benefits such as: Operational efficiency through smarter processes Marketing effectiveness via better customer insights Brand differentiation in crowded markets Stronger IP portfolios through patents and proprietary frameworks It\u2019s about creating long-term competitive moats that can\u2019t easily be copied. The Cost of Not Investing in R&D Let\u2019s flip the question: What happens when you don\u2019t invest in R&D? You risk creating products that consumers are simply not interested in. You risk becoming outdated as market trends evolve You lose first-mover advantage in emerging categories You may rely too heavily on price-cutting or marketing gimmicks You miss opportunities to create sustainable innovation pipelines Remember Blockbuster ? Or Kodak? These were industry leaders who failed to invest in innovation at critical moments\u2014because they underestimated how quickly their markets could shift. Lessons from Amazon: From Fire Phone to Alexa Amazon\u2019s evolution is a masterclass in R&D marketing. The infamous Fire Phone failure showed what happens when R&D pushes ahead without enough customer insight\u2014it was innovative but irrelevant. User feedback post-launch revealed that it missed the mark because it offered gimmicky features like Dynamic Perspective and Firefly that didn\u2019t add real value, lacked access to key apps due to its limited Fire OS ecosystem, and was priced like a premium smartphone without delivering comparable performance or design. Consumers saw it more as a tool to drive Amazon sales than a user-focused device, and its AT&T exclusivity further limited its appeal. Ultimately, it didn\u2019t differentiate itself meaningfully or align with user needs, making it a commercial flop. It\u2019s now often cited as a textbook example of how not to launch a smartphone. By contrast, Alexa was born from deep user research into voice behavior, home automation trends, and communication preferences. The development team worked closely with marketing to define use cases that would resonate. In 2015, the first full year after Alexa and the Echo became widely available, Amazon sold approximately 4.4 million Echo units, according to estimates from Activate Inc. This powerhouse of a company has shown exactly what the benefits of research and development are to any company looking to launch products or services. Now, across its product ecosystem\u2014from AWS tools to Kindle and Echo\u2014Amazon relies heavily on data and feedback loops to fine-tune offerings and pivot quickly when needed. Coca-Cola and Community Feedback in R&D Though Coca-Cola may not be a tech company, it\u2019s an example of how legacy brands can embrace data to guide innovation. The Freestyle vending machines , a touchscreen vending machine that lets users mix and choose from 150+ drink options, including custom flavors of Coca-Cola products, for instance, do more than dispense drinks\u2014they collect real-time data on user preferences , which Coca-Cola then uses to guide product launches, seasonal variations, and packaging decisions. With over 150 customizable beverage options, these machines allow Coca-Cola to gather granular data on flavor preferences, consumption patterns, and emerging trends across diverse markets. This data-driven approach enables the company to test new flavors at scale with minimal risk, rapidly iterate based on consumer behavior, and identify high-potential products for broader retail distribution. By integrating customer feedback directly into product development, Coca-Cola shortens innovation cycles, reduces waste, and increases the likelihood of market success\u2014effectively turning R&D into a customer co-creation engine that fuels both product relevance and profitability. This is R&D marketing in action: gathering granular user behavior data to create new offerings with high confidence in market demand. The Role of Community Platforms in Product Innovation As companies grow more customer-centric, community platforms are becoming essential for real-time input and engagement. These platforms\u2014ranging from Reddit forums to owned branded communities \u2014enable brands to: Test feature ideas with their most engaged users Conduct polls and interviews at scale Crowdsource product improvements Rather than relying solely on formal focus groups or post-launch feedback, community platforms offer a way to continuously validate product assumptions throughout the development lifecycle.A standout example of this approach is TBo Clothing , a men's underwear and basics brand that has built its entire product development model around co-creation. Instead of designing products behind closed doors, TBo invites its community\u2014referred to as the \u201cTribe\u201d\u2014into every step of the innovation process. TBo\u2019s Tribe is hosted on a dedicated platform where thousands of customers participate in ideation, feedback, and testing. Before launching any new product, TBo engages the Tribe with polls and open-ended questions about design preferences, material choices, and even packaging. This input is not just for show: it actively shapes the final products. For example, TBo\u2019s best-selling bamboo boxer briefs were co-designed based on community insights around comfort, breathability, and fit. This real-time dialogue replaces traditional R&D processes with an agile, iterative model. Instead of long product cycles punctuated by isolated user testing, TBo\u2019s co-creation loop is continuous. Their community acts as a dynamic feedback engine\u2014spotting issues early, proposing enhancements, and validating new ideas before they reach market. For brands looking to de-risk innovation and build fiercely loyal customer bases, TBo demonstrates how community-led R&D is not just possible\u2014it\u2019s preferable. By empowering customers to be collaborators rather than passive buyers, companies gain deeper insight and faster validation, all while fostering a sense of ownership that drives long-term engagement. Using Data Platforms to Connect Dots Between Marketing and R&D Modern R&D marketing strategies are powered by data platforms that unify insights across teams. For example: Customer data platforms (CDPs) collect behavioral signals from websites, products, and emails. Marketing analytics tools surface campaign-level performance. Product analytics tools (like Mixpanel or Amplitude) track feature usage. When these data streams are shared, teams can see which features are driving engagement, what messaging resonates, and where friction occurs. This integrated view fuels more precise development choices. Integrating R&D efforts with AI-powered platforms allows brands to streamline innovation, accelerate product development, and make data-driven decisions with greater precision. AI can uncover hidden patterns in consumer behavior, forecast trends, and enhance ideation processes\u2014all while reducing time and resource expenditure. This fusion empowers teams to move faster from concept to execution, with smarter feedback loops and continuous optimization. The Decommerce community platform is the ideal environment for modern R&D. Not only does it foster direct engagement with real consumers, but it also comes integrated with AI tools that help brands gather insights, test ideas, and improve outcomes\u2014all within a single, unified space. How Generative AI Enhances R&D Marketing Generative AI is transforming how teams prototype, test, and market new products. In R&D, AI can: Generate design mockups based on user behavior Simulate customer personas for testing Predict market responses to new features or formats From the Pharmaceutical & Biotech , Automotive & Manufacturing and even Consumer Goods generative AI is helping companies boom: Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies (ELC) : In collaboration with Microsoft, ELC established an AI innovation lab to leverage generative AI across its beauty brands. The lab focuses on rapid trend identification, product development, and improving customer experiences Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) : India's leading IT firm reports that generative AI has shortened product development cycles by up to 20% in engineering R&D, enhancing productivity in one of the industry's fastest-growing niches. ZS & AWS : Partnering with a leading biopharma company, ZS and AWS developed a generative AI tool that reduced analytics time by 98% , cutting efforts from 4\u20135 hours to just 3\u20134 minutes per query. In marketing, AI tools can produce variations of product messaging, social media content, or email campaigns for A/B testing\u2014aligned with the development timeline. By introducing AI earlier in the workflow, brands can iterate faster and personalize more deeply. From Feedback to Product Strategy User feedback is no longer just a nice-to-have\u2014it\u2019s a strategic asset . Forward-thinking companies: Collect feedback continuously (not just post-launch) Use qualitative insights to guide product design Close the loop by sharing outcomes with users Whether it\u2019s through surveys, app reviews, or active community engagement, consistent feedback collection leads to fewer failed experiments and more aligned products. A Community-Driven Approach to Product Roadmapping Building in public isn\u2019t just for startups anymore. Many companies now invite users to co-shape product roadmaps , often using dedicated community spaces. This open approach creates: Stronger brand loyalty Higher retention , because users see their input reflected Fewer surprises when products launch While not every idea should make it to production, involving users in early ideation helps teams focus on what truly matters\u2014and avoid overbuilding.

Through integrated gamification mechanics such as badges, polls, rewards, and milestones, brands can incentivize participation in ways that feel natural and engaging. This doesn\u2019t just build loyalty\u2014it generates high-quality, structured feedback that can be directly applied to R&D. For startups, this might mean validating MVP features; for enterprise teams, it enables continuous iteration based on market sentiment. In an era where timely insights can make or break a launch, branded communities provide a scalable, human-centered infrastructure for gathering actionable data from those who matter most: your users. \u200d Metrics That Matter in R&D Marketing The success of R&D marketing can be measured across both product and marketing KPIs , such as: - Time-to-market : Reflects alignment and agility - Feature adoption rate : Indicates product-market fit - Net Promoter Score (NPS) : Signals user satisfaction - Community engagement: Tracks feedback loops and loyalty - A/B test conversion rate : Validates marketing insights A shared dashboard between product and marketing ensures visibility across the entire development funnel. The Future of R&D Marketing: AI, Communities, and Real-Time Iteration As we look ahead, the future of R&D marketing is shaped by three forces : AI-accelerated development Community collaboration at scale Integrated data infrastructure Brands that embrace these trends will outpace those still working in silos. They\u2019ll be faster, more customer-aligned, and more adaptive in a world where change is the only constant.

Corporation that just has its life blood and advertising, in today\u2019s brave New World I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be profitable. Unless Google basics and bitcoin somewhere, the future of Google is bleak. Advertising is the issue assuming that there\u2019s no turning back the clocks of time, that the tariffs against China will be semi permanent, then the big issue: Less advertising revenue because your people will be promoting their products because once again, all the production is made in China. Key Points Research suggests Google\u2019s stock decline is due to high AI spending with uncertain returns, legal antitrust issues, and missed earnings. It seems likely that competition from Chinese AI startups and broader tech market trends are also contributing factors. The evidence leans toward these issues creating investor uncertainty, though long-term prospects remain strong. Reasons for the Stock Decline Google\u2019s stock, under Alphabet Inc., has seen a significant drop due to several interconnected factors. Here\u2019s a breakdown for clarity: AI Spending Concerns : Alphabet plans to invest up to $75 billion in AI, exceeding expectations by $15 billion, raising doubts about ROI. Analysts like UBS and JPMorgan lowered price targets, citing the need for new products to justify this Investopedia: Google Parent Alphabet\u2019s Stock Tumbles Amid Worries Whether AI Spending Will Pay Off . Legal Challenges : A federal judge ruled Google operates an illegal ad monopoly, potentially leading to forced sales of ad products. Ongoing antitrust cases are also impacting valuation Wall Street Journal: Judge Rules Google Operates Illegal Ad Monopoly . Earnings Miss : Q4 revenue was $96.5 billion, slightly below the $96.6 billion expected, with cloud growth underperforming, contributing to a post-earnings stock drop Forbes: What\u2019s Happening With GOOG Stock? . Market and Competition : A tech sell-off, competition from Chinese AI like DeepSeek, and broader market unease over tariffs are adding pressure Nasdaq: Alphabet Stock Has Lost Over $500 Billion in Market Cap . These factors have collectively eroded investor confidence, though Alphabet\u2019s long-term position in tech remains robust. Detailed Analysis and Survey Note Google\u2019s stock, represented by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), has experienced a notable decline, reflecting a complex interplay of financial, legal, and market dynamics as of April 17, 2025. This analysis synthesizes information from multiple reputable sources to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving this downturn, offering insights for investors and stakeholders. Financial Performance and Investor Reactions Alphabet\u2019s recent financial performance has been a significant contributor to the stock\u2019s decline. The company\u2019s Q4 earnings, released earlier this year, reported sales of $96.5 billion, falling short of the consensus estimate of $96.6 billion, despite earnings per share of $2.15 exceeding expectations of $2.13 Forbes: What\u2019s Happening With GOOG Stock? . This revenue miss, coupled with weaker-than-expected cloud growth at 30% year-over-year compared to analyst forecasts, led to a 7% stock plunge post-announcement. The cloud segment, a critical growth area, underperformed, raising concerns among investors about Alphabet\u2019s ability to meet growth targets Investopedia: Google Parent Alphabet\u2019s Stock Tumbles Amid Worries Whether AI Spending Will Pay Off . Further exacerbating investor unease is Alphabet\u2019s aggressive capital expenditure plan. The company announced a $75 billion investment for the year, $15 billion more than Wall Street anticipated, with a significant portion allocated to AI infrastructure expansion. This high spending, while aimed at meeting demand, has raised questions about the return on investment (ROI), especially as analysts like UBS lowered their price target from $211 to $191, and JPMorgan adjusted theirs from $232 to $220, suggesting investors may need to wait for AI initiatives to pay off Investopedia: Google Parent Alphabet\u2019s Stock Tumbles Amid Worries Whether AI Spending Will Pay Off . Bank of America, however, maintained a \u201cbuy\u201d rating with a $225 target, suggesting potential benefits from AI overviews for search monetization in 2025, indicating a split in analyst sentiment. Legal and Regulatory Challenges Legal challenges have added significant pressure on Alphabet\u2019s stock. On a recent Thursday, a federal judge ruled that Google created a monopoly controlling parts of the online-advertising industry, marking the second time in eight months the company has been labeled an illegal monopolist Wall Street Journal: Judge Rules Google Operates Illegal Ad Monopoly . This ruling could lead to the Justice Department seeking forced sales of some of Google\u2019s advertising products, a move that could disrupt its core revenue streams. Additionally, ongoing antitrust cases, including allegations of monopolizing general search services, have contributed to a lower valuation multiple compared to peers like Amazon (38x forward earnings) and Microsoft (32x forward earnings) Forbes: What\u2019s Happening With GOOG Stock? . These legal overhangs have weighed heavily on investor sentiment, with proposals like selling key assets such as Chrome and potentially Android further fueling uncertainty Wall Street Journal: Judge Rules Google Operates Illegal Ad Monopoly . Competitive Landscape and Market Dynamics Competition from emerging players, particularly in the AI space, has also impacted Alphabet\u2019s stock. A notable example is DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup claiming to develop a rival AI model at a fraction of the cost, raising concerns about the efficiency and competitiveness of American firms\u2019 AI spending Investopedia: Google Parent Alphabet\u2019s Stock Tumbles Amid Worries Whether AI Spending Will Pay Off . This competition, combined with Meta\u2019s perceived clearer ROI path through advertising with its $60-65 billion investment, has led to unfavorable comparisons for Alphabet, further pressuring its stock Investopedia: Google Parent Alphabet\u2019s Stock Tumbles Amid Worries Whether AI Spending Will Pay Off . Broader market dynamics have also played a role. Alphabet has been caught in a tech sell-off, losing over $500 billion in market cap, dropping its valuation from over $2.5 trillion to $2 trillion in recent weeks Nasdaq: Alphabet Stock Has Lost Over $500 Billion in Market Cap . The Nasdaq Composite, tech-heavy and indicative of sector trends, entered a correction with a nearly 13% decline over 13 trading sessions, reflecting investor unease over factors like Trump\u2019s tariffs and AI spending Yahoo Finance: Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Latest Stock News & Headlines . Despite these challenges, some analysts see Alphabet as undervalued at current prices, with a valuation estimate of $200 per share based on 22x expected 2025 earnings of $9.07, compared to its historical average P/E of 18x Forbes: What\u2019s Happening With GOOG Stock? . Investor Sentiment and Long-Term Outlook The combination of these factors has created significant investor uncertainty, with the stock experiencing its largest single-day decline in value, erasing up to $211 billion in market value on February 5, 2025, following the earnings report Times of India: Google loses $200 billion-plus in market value; biggest-ever single-day decline . Despite this, some analysts argue that Alphabet remains a solid buy, given its better finances compared to other Magnificent Seven stocks, though caution is advised due to the ongoing challenges Nasdaq: Alphabet Stock Has Lost Over $500 Billion in Market Cap . In summary, the decline in Google\u2019s stock is driven by a mix of internal financial decisions, legal battles, competitive pressures, and external market conditions. While short-term volatility is evident, Alphabet\u2019s long-term prospects in the tech industry, particularly in AI and cloud computing, remain strong, though investors are currently focused on navigating the uncertainties outlined above. Summary Table of Key Factors Factor Details Impact on Stock AI Spending $75 billion capex, $15B over expected, ROI concerns Negative, analyst downgrades Legal Issues Ad monopoly ruling, potential forced sales, ongoing antitrust cases Negative, valuation pressure Earnings Miss Q4 revenue $96.5B vs. $96.6B expected, cloud growth below forecasts Negative, post-earnings drop Competition Chinese AI like DeepSeek, comparisons to Meta\u2019s ROI Negative, investor unease Market Dynamics Tech sell-off, Nasdaq correction, tariff concerns Negative, broader sell-off This table encapsulates the multifaceted reasons behind the stock\u2019s decline, providing a structured overview for stakeholders.

I had used a few random setting sprays in the past, and they never did ANYTHING; my makeup would run down my face as soon as I got in the sun. I bought this before a trip to the beach because I wanted something with SPF I could spray on my pale, sensitive face (and if it happened to also help my makeup stay, even better!). I was BEYOND impressed with how well this setting spray works; my makeup still looked great even after hours of walking around the beach underneath the California sun.

A water-resistant sand-sifting mat designed to let sand, dirt, and crumbs fall through without coming back up so you aren't bringing half the beach home with you. This double-sided mat also has built-in D-ring corners for staking it down on windy days. Amazon Promising review: \"I used this as a 'veranda' in front of my tent in a sandy rock outcropping in heavy Wyoming wind. When sand was tracked onto the blanket, all I had to do was wave my hand or foot over the sand pile, and it fell right through the weaves of fabric, not to come back up. The benefits included not tracking sand into my tent, having a clean space to roll up my sleeping bag (without sand all over it), a sandless spot to lay our gear and organize, and a perfect un-sandy area to sit and chat with friends. I loved it. We camped on the sand in 40-mph swirling gusts of a stormy weekend. On my first campout in this location (without this blanket), a lot of sand covered my gear inside the tent. But with the camping mat, what an improvement!\" \u2014 Alexandra B. Get it from Amazon for $64.99+ (available in four sizes and three colors).

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Tech Connector Follow Author Apr 17, 2025, 11:00pm EDT Share Save Comment The late Don Valentine, founder of Sequoia Capital. Steve Jennings/Getty images Investors looking for winners in the age of AI should follow the advice of Don Valentine, the late founder of Sequoia Capital. Tariffs and tech\u2014 these twin forces are rocking the world, from markets to militaries. But how exactly? How can we ride this change to our advantage? Or at least not get crushed. Let\u2019s look at tech today, AI specifically. A hero of mine\u2014a favorite interview as a young journalist\u2014is the late Don Valentine. The founder of Sequoia Capital, Don is rightly remembered as one of the great Silicon Valley venture capitalists. Being directionally right was Don\u2019s north star. If you make your bets in the right quadrant (of future possibilities), you\u2019ll win. Think one or two 10x-to-100x hits per fund along with a handful of 5x successes to make the fund\u2019s partners happy. Here Don liked to pause for effect. You\u2019ll get no wins if you make bets in the wrong three quadrants, he said. His advice to fellow VCs: Save your analytics and clever case studies for later. Priority one is investing in the right quadrant. Two things get you there, Don said. Both were observable and measurable, so you were indeed a lazy VC if you didn\u2019t see them. One, know the speed of the underlying technology. From 1965 to 2015, Moore\u2019s Law made that easy. It showed investors a predictable future based on yearly rates of transistor density improvement in a microprocessor. Don dined on Moore\u2019s Law. MORE FOR YOU The 5 Best Water Flossers, According To Extensive Testing Amazon Prime Video\u2019s Best New Show Has A Perfect 100% Critic Score Delete All Texts On Your Phone If You See These 2 Words But around 2015 Moore\u2019s Law was pushed aside for a faster rate of evolution. Nvidia\u2019s graphic processors paired with breakthrough deep learning algorithms from Google and others gave wings to cutting-edge artificial intelligence, which had been an investment dead-end since the 1980s. Now AI was reborn as tech\u2019s leader, the new gating factor of change, moving twice as fast (at least) as Moore\u2019s Law. Think of it this way. If you spoke of Moore\u2019s Law in investment terms, it would be like a 30%-40% compound annual rate of return. Who would refuse that? But today\u2019s AI is equivalent to a 75%-100% CAGR. How long will AI\u2019s astonishing acceleration rate last? Maybe a decade or two. Maybe a half century like Moore\u2019s Law. The other clue you\u2019ve found the right investment quadrant, said Don, is early customer enthusiasm. In the right quadrant, customers don\u2019t need hard selling. They hear of the product through word-of-mouth, they see it, fiddle with it, buy it. High costs of sales and lengthy closings are eliminated. So are high marketing costs, because happy customers will do the promotion for you. Before Don had started Sequoia, he had run sales at a big semiconductor company. Like all salespeople, Don liked products that sold themselves. Less work, more revenue, fatter bonuses. Where is AI thriving? An early clue is where data center capacity is booming. Similar clue: Where are the world\u2019s largest data center operators expanding? If data center growth globally is roughly 15% a year, per JLL Research, which countries and regions are seeing the highest demand? Where are the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle and Google pouring their billions? Here\u2019s a hint: the CEOs of those companies have all visited ASEAN countries in the last year. Data center capacity in ASEAN is projected to keep pace with double-digit global growth. Here\u2019s a prediction. Big winners in the AI age will not just be AI companies, but the best and fastest adopters of AI in their businesses\u2014in agriculture, manufacturing, shipping, transportation, consumer packaging\u2014the whole range of modern businesses around the world. The best adopters will be the smartest and most nimble. Slow-moving companies will be in trouble. The richest of the big and slow will try to buy their way to AI operational excellence (through mergers). They will lose to the world\u2019s champion adopters.

Analysts describe The Warehouse as a \"sunset\" brand, set to slowly decline out of business. So what are the challenges it needs to address to turnaround? Photo / Jason Oxenham Shares in The Warehouse are trading around their lowest levels since listing on the stock exchange. The company doesn\u2019t have a permanent chief executive nearly a year after its last chief executive resigned and its revenue and profit margin is under pressure. Interim chief executive John Journee is undertaking a turnaround but what will it take to get New Zealand\u2019s largest retailer back in the game? Warehouse Group interim chief executive John Journee. Photo / Supplied In its 2025 first-half result in late March , it posted a return to profit of $11.8 million. However, revenue continued to decline, falling to $1.6 billion, down 1.6% compared to the first half of 2024. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. The retailer\u2019s earnings before interest and tax also took a significant hit, down 54.5% to $19.5m, while gross profit margins decreased a further 180 basis points to 32.5%. Following the result, Journee said the transition was still in its early days, but the result was an encouraging early sign. \u201cThese are our first results under our new strategy and they reflect a business in transition. We\u2019re resetting the focus, addressing legacy issues and embedding our brand-led structure and approach,\u201d Journee said. \u201cWe\u2019re very focused on what we can do and there\u2019s heaps that we can do and are doing. I suppose an advantage of basically leaving opportunities on the table is you can pick them up and run with them.\u201d Advertisement Advertise with NZME. But as The Warehouse continues to face margin pressures, weak consumer demand and confidence, and more competition entering the market, what do analysts believe are the biggest challenges facing The Warehouse? Kmart is The Warehouse's largest competitor, and its unique product and supply chain process is a key differentiator. Model vs margins Clare Capital senior analyst Laura Matthews thinks a key difference between The Warehouse and its biggest competitor, Kmart, and a potential reason why it is falling behind, is its supply chain and procurement process. Kmart, which revealed a bumper $106 million profit for its 2024 financial year , has a unique model in which 85% of products it sells are from its internal brand, Anko. These products are designed by a Kmart-owned product development company, Anko Global, and utilising a network of 900 manufacturers, it can bring a new product to market in just 180 days. \u201cThey [Kmart] can have more control over the production and the end products, whereas The Warehouse is more of the traditional retailer model where they have to go out and find existing products that they can buy and stock for the end customers,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between those two business models, and that reflects in the operating profit margins.\u201d For the 2024 financial year, The Warehouse had an operating profit margin of roughly 2%, compared to Kmart\u2019s 2024 result where it was roughly 16%, eight times higher. Not helping that situation is the growth of grocery for the red sheds, a particularly low-margin segment. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. It now represents 25.8% of total sales for The Warehouse, with category sales up 12.5% on the 2023 financial year. \u201cAt the same time while it\u2019s growing, their home and apparel segments are shrinking, and they\u2019re the higher margin segments that ideally you want to be making up more of your sales. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a good gross margin to start, you\u2019re never going to get a good operating margin at the end,\u201d Matthews said. IKEA's first New Zealand store at Auckland's Sylvia Park is set to open before the end of the year. Photo / 123RF The Swedish are coming Perhaps the biggest challenge ahead for the red sheds is not necessarily its internal struggles, but the external competitors that are on the rise or set to open, with no bigger disruptor than Swedish giant Ikea set to open this year. Forsyth Barr analysis has forecast Ikea to earn $191 million in sales over its first year in business, and to take roughly 6% of the NZ furniture, floor coverings, housewares, and textiles market. According to their analysis, The Warehouse currently holds roughly 11% of that market share, with Kmart sitting on 7%. A retailer entering the market and taking market share roughly the size of their biggest competitor is a serious concern. Chris Wilkinson, managing director of First Retail, believes there is a lot of big box retailers creeping into The Warehouse\u2019s categories. \u201cThe challenge for them is that they\u2019re in this really difficult middle ground. All those areas where they potentially have been able to win in the past, there\u2019s this cannibalisation. \u201cThe Warehouse is across so many of these different categories that [it] makes it particularly challenging for them to find something that they can own decisively and be successful.\u201d He thinks the brand needs to refine and possibly grow product categories that separate it from the likes of Kmart and Ikea to find its edge, including areas like gardening and, perhaps controversially, grocery. Wilkinson said that consumers are realising the value on offer for the staple products it introduced, but getting them to recognise The Warehouse as a serious grocery player is a much harder task. \u201cThe biggest challenge is they\u2019ve got to be able to deliver grocery with convenience. If you\u2019ve only got one aisle, the key thing is you don\u2019t need lots of products. The real aspect is to have volume, more of less is the key and to be able to deliver convenience. \u201cIf they can leverage that and actually turn it around a decent margin on it, there\u2019s opportunity there.\u201d The rise and rise of online retailers has hit an all-time high \u2013 with the likes of Temu and Shein dominating consumption worldwide. A brand in sunset? A recent report by Forsyth Barr analysts Paul Koraua and Rohan Koreman-Smit titled Retail Rundown Retailer Life Cycles , described the four phases of a retailer. The pair looked at 53 listed retailers, with more than 1000 financial years of data, to understand the shareholder returns retailers have historically delivered depending on where they are in the life cycle. The four phases include growth, optimisation, maturity, and finally sunset. In sunset, both store count and earnings per store are in decline typically because of long-term market share loss, broader industry or consumer preference shifts, and/or management mis-execution. Competitors of The Warehouse including Briscoe Group, KMD Brands and Hallenstein Glassons all range from optimisation to maturity. Unfortunately for The Warehouse, Koraua and Koreman-Smit believe the business \u201cis displaying all the characteristics of a company in sunset\u201d. Koraua explained that the categorisation doesn\u2019t mean the business is going to go under in the near future, but more about how the business has been trending over the last 10 to 15 years. \u201cIf you take a wide lens and have a look over the last 20 years, you\u2019ve seen earnings before interest and tax (ebit) margins decline pretty materially,\u201d Koraua said. \u201cGross margins have still always been pretty solid for the company, but it\u2019s been mixed market share losses and an inability to control costs which has really hurt the most in the long run.\u201d Koraua agreed that competition is a key challenge for the retailer, referencing the impact from Kmart and Ikea once it opens will continue to have, with the now added pressure of e-commerce retailers such as Temu and Shein. Latest figures from Stats NZ show imports of low-value goods, purchased directly by households, increased by almost a third last year, and have more than doubled since before the pandemic. He also acknowledged Wilkinson\u2019s point about category creep, believing the only category The Warehouse may be performing better than Kmart is in toys. But, overall, Koraua thinks that identifying areas of opportunity for The Warehouse is a \u201csuper hard question\u201d. \u201cThey tried to do online and to be the New Zealand Amazon, that came crashing down. They\u2019ve tried to become everything to everyone with Warehouse Extra, that came crashing down. They tried moving to Australia, that didn\u2019t work.\u201d He highlighted the business\u2019s store network and legacy in New Zealand as key differentiators, but said they need to leverage it to benefit from it. \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting in Timaru and there\u2019s a Warehouse down the road that\u2019s been there for 30 years, you\u2019re still probably going to walk in there. If the product\u2019s been changed around and it\u2019s more attractive to consumers, maybe that\u2019s how they can start winning that market share back, winning back in the regions.\u201d Tom Raynel is a multimedia business journalist for the Herald , covering small business, retail and tourism.

He openly discussed his journey to fame, involving significant weight loss through extreme measures. Orry advocates for unconventional choices in life, including using aids to achieve goals, and maintains a strong presence at high-profile events, solidifying his status as a digital-first icon. Agencies Orhan Awatramani, widely known across the digital sphere as Orry, has carved out a distinctive niche for himself as a standout figure within India\u2019s Generation Z celebrity ecosystem. Orhan Awatramani, widely known across the digital sphere as Orry, has carved out a distinctive niche for himself as a standout figure within India\u2019s Generation Z celebrity ecosystem. Whether he's gracing glitzy Bollywood soir\u00e9es or appearing in heavily liked selfies with the offspring of film industry royalty, Orry has become an ever-present face in the country\u2019s social media and pop culture landscape. However, as he candidly confessed in a raw and unfiltered conversation on The Suvir Saran Show presented by SCREEN, the path to popularity wasn\u2019t paved solely with glamorous aesthetics and curated Instagram posts\u2014it demanded tenacity, sacrifice, and a fair share of controversy. Reflecting on his transformative journey, Orry shared, \u201cAt the beginning of 2023, I was significantly overweight\u2014around seventy-something kilograms.\u201d He went on to clarify, \u201cThis was before Ozempic even entered the picture. That was the year I set a goal to become famous. But let\u2019s be real\u2014you can\u2019t be overweight and expect to thrive in the fame game. It doesn\u2019t work that way. No one wants to see a fat, 5-foot boy on TV. \u201d Determined to reinvent himself, he embarked on a period of extreme personal discipline\u2014though often at the cost of his well-being. \u201cI put myself through a lot,\" he admitted. \u201cThere were days I went without proper meals. I remember waking up with a stiff neck once because I had passed out on the bathroom floor after vomiting up my dinner.\u201d Despite the physically and mentally draining methods he used, he managed to slim down dramatically. \u201cTechnically, it wasn\u2019t the healthiest way. It was sort of cheating\u2014but I did what I thought was necessary,\u201d he confessed. Orry\u2019s perspective on life extends beyond traditional norms. He is vocal about pushing boundaries and embracing unconventional choices. \u201cI don\u2019t endorse cheating in games\u2014that takes the fun out of winning. But in life? I fully support it,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf someone chooses Ozempic for weight loss, that\u2019s fine. If you find yourself romantically drawn to more than one person at a time, I won\u2019t judge. Even athletes who use performance enhancers\u2014I understand that too. Sometimes, you\u2019ve got to do whatever it takes to achieve your dreams.\u201d Earlier, in an episode of Arrhan Khan's podcast 'Dumb Biriyani', the influencer reveals how he lost 23 kilos. He shared that his day typically starts with a simple egg white omelet. Throughout the day, he tends to skip meals and only eats dinner on occasion. He emphasized his commitment to a strict no-sugar diet, noting that he's aiming to shed another 2\u20133 kilograms. According to him, cutting sugar is essential for managing body weight effectively. Sugar significantly influences overall weight stability. Limiting its intake is a crucial step toward successful fat loss. Despite being high in calories, sugar provides little to no nutritional benefit. When consumed in large quantities, it contributes directly to weight gain. Foods rich in sugar cause a rapid increase in blood glucose levels, which prompts the body to release insulin. This hormone not only helps regulate sugar but also promotes fat storage\u2014particularly around the belly area. Despite the polarizing nature of his opinions, Orry\u2019s cultural presence continues to grow. Frequently spotted at exclusive high-society events and luxury film parties, he\u2019s often seen socializing with prominent young actors like Ananya Panday and Janhvi Kapoor. His self-referential appearances in Amazon Prime Video\u2019s Call Me Bae and Netflix\u2019s Nadaaniyan have solidified his brand as a Gen-Z icon and personality who represents an era of digital-first celebrity. Hailing from the affluent neighborhood of Malabar Hill in South Mumbai, Orry\u2019s upbringing was privileged. He attended a boarding school in Kodaikanal and later pursued design studies at the prestigious Parsons School of Design in New York City. After returning to India, he briefly held a position at Reliance and is known to maintain a close relationship with the influential Ambani family.

Can science refreeze it? | Grist Skip to content Grist home All donations doubled! $10/mo $15/mo Other Donate Donate Courtesy of Real Ice Matilda Hay Published Apr 14, 2025 Topic Climate Share/Republish Copy Link Republish Copy Link Email SMS X Facebook Republish Reddit LinkedIn Bluesky In the dim twilight of an Arctic winter\u2019s day, with the low sun stretching its orange fingers across the frozen sea, a group of researchers drill a hole through the ice and insert a hydrogen-powered pump. It looks unremarkable \u2014 a piece of pipe protruding from a metal cylinder \u2014 but it holds many hopes for protecting this landscape. Soon, it is sucking up seawater from below and spewing it onto the surface, flooding the area with a thin layer of water. Overnight this water will freeze, thickening what\u2019s already there. The hope is that the more robust the ice, the less likely it will be to disappear in the warm summer months. Since 1979, when satellite records began, Arctic temperatures have risen nearly four times faster than the global average . Sea ice extent has decreased by about 40 percent , and the oldest and thickest ice has declined by a worrying 95 percent . What\u2019s more, scientists recently estimated that as temperatures continue to climb, the Arctic\u2019s first ice-free day could occur before 2030, in just five years\u2019 time. NASA The researchers are from Real Ice , a United Kingdom-based nonprofit on a mission to preserve this dwindling landscape. Their initial work has shown that pumping just 10 inches of ocean water on top of the ice also boosts growth from the bottom, thickening it by another 20 inches. This is because the flooding process removes the insulating snow layer, enabling more water to freeze. When the process is done, the patch of ice measured up to 80 inches thick \u2014 equal to the lower range of older, multi-year ice in the Arctic. \u201cIf that is proved to be true on a larger scale, we will show that with relatively little energy we can actually make a big gain through the winter,\u201d said Andrea Ceccolini, co-CEO of Real Ice. Ceccolini and Cian Sherwin, his partner CEO, ultimately hope to develop an underwater drone that could swim between locations, detecting the thickness of the ice, pumping up water as necessary, then refueling and moving on to the next spot.

Here's How This winter, they carried out their largest field test yet: comparing the impact of eight pumps across nearly half a square mile off the coast of Cambridge Bay, a small town in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut, part of the Canadian Arctic. They now wait until June for the results. During a January 2024 field test, a hydrogen-powered pump sucks water from Cambridge Bay, Canada and spews it onto the surface. The water will freeze and thicken the existing ice. Video courtesy of Real Ice Their work is at the heart of a debate about how we mitigate the damage caused by global warming, and whether climate interventions such as this will cause more harm than good. Loss of sea ice has consequences far beyond the Arctic. Today, the vast white expanse of this ice reflects 80 percent of the sun\u2019s energy back into space . Without it, the dark open ocean will absorb this heat, further warming the planet. According to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, if our sea ice disappears entirely, it will add the equivalent warming of 25 years of carbon dioxide emissions . There are also huge implications for our weather patterns: Diminishing sea ice is already changing ocean currents , increasing storms , and sending warmer, drier air to California, causing increased wildfires . Within the Arctic, loss of ice means loss of habitat and food security for the animals, microorganisms, and Indigenous communities that depend on it. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019m terrified,\u201d said Talia Maksagak, executive director of the Kitikmeot Chamber of Commerce, about the changing sea ice. It\u2019s freezing later and thinner each year, affecting her community\u2019s ability to travel between islands. \u201cPeople go missing, people are traveling and they fall through the ice,\u201d she continues. They also rely on the ice for hunting, fishing, and harvests of wild caribou or musk ox, who migrate across the frozen ocean twice a year \u2014 although they, too, are increasingly falling through the thin ice and drowning . Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one . To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How Maksagak has been instrumental in helping Real Ice to consult with the local community about their research, and she is supportive of their work. \u201cIf Real Ice comes up with this genius plan to continue the ice freeze longer, I think that would be very beneficial for future generations.\u201d Researchers get ready to connect their pump system to the hydrogen battery that powers it. Real Ice There are still many questions around the feasibility of Real Ice\u2019s plan, both for critics and the Real Ice researchers themselves. First, they need to establish if the principle works scientifically \u2014 that the ice they\u2019ve thickened does last longer, counteracting the speed of global warming\u2019s impact on the region. At worst, adding salty seawater could potentially cause the ice to melt more quickly in the summer. But results from last year\u2019s research suggest not: When testing its pilot ice three months later, Real Ice found its salinity was within normal bounds. If all goes well with this year\u2019s tests, the next step will be an independent environmental risk assessment. Noise is one concern. According to WWF, industrial underwater noise significantly alters the behavior of marine mammals , especially whales. Similarly, blue cod lay their eggs under the ice, algae grows on it, and larger mammals and birds migrate across it. How will they be impacted by Real Ice\u2019s water pumps? \u201cThese are all questions that we need to ask,\u201d said Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the Center for Climate Repair at Cambridge University, which has partnered with Real Ice, \u201cand they all need to be addressed before we can start evaluating whether or not we think this is a good idea.\u201d Fitzgerald predicts four more years of research are needed before the nonprofit can properly recommend the technology. For now, the Nunavut Impact Review Board, Nunavut\u2019s environmental assessment agency, has deemed Real Ice\u2019s research sites to cause no significant impact . New ice forms on the surface of Cambridge Bay, Canada. Real Ice But critics of the idea argue the process won\u2019t scale. \u201cThe numbers just don\u2019t stack up,\u201d said Martin Siegert, a British glaciologist and former co-chair of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change. He pointed to the size of the Arctic \u2014 3.9 million square miles of sea ice on average \u2014 and how many pumps would likely be needed to freeze even 10 percent of that. More importantly, who is going to pay for it? Ceccolini is undaunted by the first question. Their technology is not complicated \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s technology from 50 years ago, we just need to assemble it in a new way\u201d \u2014 and would cost an estimated $5,000 per autonomous pump. Their models predict that 500,000 pumps could rethicken about 386,000 square miles of sea ice each year, or an area half the size of Alaska. Assuming the thicker ice lasts several years, and by targeting different areas annually, Ceccolini estimates the technology could maintain the current summer sea ice levels of around 1.63 million square miles . \u201cWe\u2019ve done much bigger things in humanity, much more complex than this,\u201d he said. As for who pays, that\u2019s less clear. One idea is a global fund similar to what\u2019s been proposed for tropical rainforests , where if a resource is globally beneficial, like the Amazon or the Arctic, then an international community contributes to its protection. Another idea is \u201ccooling credits,\u201d where organizations can pay for a certain amount of ice to be frozen as an offset against global warming. These are a controversial idea started by the California-based, geoengineering start-up Make Sunsets, which believes that stratospheric aerosol injections \u2014 releasing reflective particles high into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere \u2014 is another way to cool the planet. However its research comes with many risks and unknowns that has the scientific community worried , and has even been banned in Mexico . Meanwhile faith in the credits system has been undermined in recent years, with several investigations revealing a lack of integrity in the carbon credits industry. A researcher looks out from a field site tent onto Cambridge Bay, Canada, where Real Ice ran back-to-back tests in 2024 and 2025. Real Ice Panganga Pungowiyi, climate geoengineering organizer for the Indigenous Environmental Network, a nonprofit for environmental and economic justice issues, is vehemently against cooling and carbon credits in principle, explaining that they are \u201ctotally against our [Indigenous] value system.\u201d She explained that, \u201cit\u2019s essentially helping the fossil fuel industry escape accountability and cause harm in other Indigenous communities \u2014 more pain, more lung disease, more cancer.\u201d This gets to the heart of the debate \u2014 not whether a solution like this can be done, but whether it should be done. Inuit opinion is divided. Whilst Maksagak is supportive of Real Ice, Pungowiyi says the technology doesn\u2019t align with Indigenous values, and is concerned about the potential harms of scaling it. In addition to the environmental concerns, Pungowiyi notes that new infrastructure in the Arctic has historically also brought outsiders, often men, and an increase of physical and sexual assault on Indigenous women , many who end up missing or murdered . Ceccolini and Sherwin are aware of such risks and they are clear that any scaling of their technology would be done in partnership with the local community. They hope the project will eventually be Indigenous-run. Scientists use augers to drill through Arctic ice to install the pumps. They do this work in the winter, with the hope that the thickened ice lasts longer during summer months. Real Ice \u201cWe don\u2019t want to repeat the kind of mistakes that have been made by Western researchers and organizations in the past,\u201d said Sherwin. Real Ice is not the only company that wants to protect the Arctic. Arctic Reflections , a Dutch company, is conducting similar ice thickening research in Svalbard; the Arctic Ice Project is assessing if glass beads spread over the ice can increase its reflectivity and protect it from melting; and engineer Hugh Hunt\u2019s Marine Cloud Brightening initiative aims to increase the reflectivity of clouds through sprayed particles of sea salt as a way to protect the ice. \u201cI think these ideas are getting far too much prominence in relation to their credibility and maturity,\u201d said Seigert, referring to conversations about Arctic preservation at annual United Nations climate change meetings, known as COP, and the World Economic Forum. It is not only that these technologies are currently unproven, Seigert noted, but that people are already making policy decisions based on their success. It\u2019s an argument known as \u201cmoral hazard\u201d \u2014 the idea that developing climate engineering technologies will reduce people\u2019s desire to cut emissions. \u201cThis is like a gift to the fossil fuel companies,\u201d he said, allowing them to continue using oil, gas, and coal without change. \u201cWe have the way forward, decarbonization , and we need every effort to make that happen. Any distraction away from that is a problem.\u201d Freshly pumped seawater freezes to form layers of new ice in Cambridge Bay. Real Ice \u201cIt\u2019s a strong argument,\u201d agreed Fitzgerald, of Cambridge University, when asked about moral hazard. \u201cI am concerned about it. It\u2019s the one thing that probably does cause me to have sleepless nights. However, we need to look at the lesser of two evils, the risk of not doing this research.\u201d Or, as Sherwin said: \u201cWhat is the cost of inaction?\u201d Those in support of climate intervention strategies stress that, although decarbonization is vital, it\u2019s moving too slowly, and there is a lack of political will. Technologies like those being developed by Real Ice could buy ourselves more time. Paul Beckwith, a climate system analyst from the University of Ottawa, espouts a three-pronged approach : eliminating fossil fuels, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and protecting the Arctic. \u201cIt should be less a conversation of one over the other and more how we run all three pillars at the same time,\u201d said Sherwin. \u201cUnfortunately we\u2019re in a position now where if we don\u2019t protect and restore ecosystems, we will face collapse.\u201d A message from All donations DOUBLED for a limited time Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

Tycoon2FA, a phishing kit discovered in 2023 by cybersecurity firm Sekoia, was recently updated to improve its evasion capabilities. The phishing kit now uses advanced evasion tactics such as a custom CAPTCHA via HTML5 canvas, invisible Unicode in obfuscated JavaScript, and anti-debugging scripts to bypass detection and hinder analysis. \u201cLately, the Tycoon 2FA landing pages have incorporated a clever obfuscation technique using invisible Unicode characters. This technique, when paired with JavaScript Proxy objects, is designed to complicate static analysis and defer script execution until runtime.\u201d reported Trustwave . \u201cThis behavior is demonstrated in a real-world Tycoon 2FA phishing landing page, as shown in this Urlscan.io session: https://urlscan.io/result/0195c73f-bfd0-7000-8386-94b11ace6088/dom/ \u201c Source: Trustwave \u2013 Tycoon 2FA using invisible Unicode characters to encode JavaScript code. The obfuscation is actually quite simple but clever. Tycoon 2FA replaced third-party CAPTCHAs like Cloudflare Turnstile with a custom HTML5 canvas-based solution. This improvement allows for evading detection, reduces fingerprinting, and hinders automated analysis using randomized text, noise, and distortions. The Phishing-as-a-Service platform uses anti-debugging scripts to block dev tools, detect automation, prevent right-click, and spot paused execution. If analysis is suspected, it redirects to rakuten.com boosting evasion and extending phishing campaign lifespans. \u201cThe recent updates to the Tycoon 2FA kit show a clear move toward stealth and evasion. While none of these techniques are groundbreaking individually, their combined use can complicate detection and response.\u201d concludes the report that includes Yara rule for detection. \u201cSecurity teams should consider behavior-based monitoring, browser sandboxing, and a deeper inspection of JavaScript patterns to stay ahead of these tactics.\u201d Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini ( SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, phishing) facebook linkedin twitter Cybercrime Hacking hacking news information security news IT Information Security malware PhaaS Pierluigi Paganini Security Affairs Security News Tycoon2FA PhaaS you might also like Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Read more Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Read more leave a comment newsletter Subscribe to my email list and stay up-to-date! recent articles Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Data Breach / April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Hacking / April 15, 2025 New malware \u2018ResolverRAT\u2019 targets healthcare, pharmaceutical firms Malware / April 14, 2025 Malicious NPM packages target PayPal users Security / April 14, 2025 Tycoon2FA phishing kit rolled out significant updates Cyber Crime / April 14, 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

The dark hero manga centers on three young kids who attempt to take their own lives out of despair and hopelessness for the world, but fail in the attempt. In the hospital, they awaken to a power inside them that could allow them to be heroes. But the directionless trio, who feel there is no place for them in the world, begin an ultimate betrayal of humanity. Kaneko launched the manga in Kadokawa 's Comic Beam magazine in August 2020. The manga inspired a live-action series that premiered in November 2023. Digital Manga Publishing released two of six volumes of Kaneko's earlier manga Bambi and her Pink Gun in English in 2005. Kaneko's SOIL manga inspired a live-action television series in 2010. SOIL and Kaneko's Wet Moon were previously nominated for Best Crime Comic at France's Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival. Kaneko launched the Search and Destroy manga, based on Osamu Tezuka 's Dororo manga, in Micro Magazine Publishing Company's TezuComi magazine in October 2018, and ended it after 18 chapters. Mangasplaining began serializing the manga in the Mangasplaining Extra (MSX) newsletter in August 2023. Fantagraphics and Mangasplaining Extra published the manga in print.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . If you feel like you have no idea what anything's supposed to cost anymore, you're not alone. The pandemic and subsequent bout of inflation sent prices all over the place, and now we're facing down whatever is going on with tariffs at any given moment. Unfortunately, our collective state of sticker \"Huh?\" is likely to get worse. Thanks to a whipsawing economic landscape and the magic of technology, prices can change faster than ever \u2014 the price you see in the morning may not be the same that same afternoon. Maybe that new price tag is the result of changing supply and demand dynamics. Maybe it's tariffs. Maybe it's corporate funny business. The unfunny part is that it's impossible for many consumers to know. You might remember the brief dustup around Wendy's and dynamic pricing last year. Its CEO said on an earnings call that the company was going to test out price variations and AI-enabled menu changes, and the internet did a little bit of a freakout. The episode was a sign of the times: Rapid-fire price changes are everywhere. Thanks to digital price tags, QR codes, and the shift to online shopping, it's easier than ever for companies to move prices at the drop of a hat. The pandemic helped firms get more agile at reacting to shocks to the system. Instability represents a prime opportunity to make adjustments, including to a business' benefit. \"Given this really uncertain, volatile environment, if you're a company who's been thinking of doing dynamic pricing, it could be a good opportunity,\" said Z. John Zhang, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business who studies pricing strategies and targeting. \"This could be a good occasion, a good excuse, an alibi for them to move in that direction.\" It used to be the case that dynamic pricing \u2014 meaning the price of something moving up or down based on market conditions \u2014 was largely reserved for flights, hotels, and Ubers. Consumers didn't love the idea their airfare in July was going to run them double what it would in February, but they got it \u2014 thus are the rules of supply and demand. But variable pricing is creeping across the economy, including places where it feels a little less understandable. Now, we're in a super-dynamic environment, given the uncertainty emanating from the White House and the global economy. In turn, it's a moment for a super-dynamic approach to prices. Volatility is always a part of business, but now we're facing a \"trifecta of volatility,\" said Craig Zawada, chief visionary officer at Pros Holdings, a price optimization company. First, costs are changing quickly \u2014 in the past , a company might negotiate once or twice a year with a supplier, but now they're having to review their agreements all the time. Second, competitive fluctuations are happening. Businesses in the same industry tend to have similar inputs, but not always. If the guy next door imports from China and you don't, you've got an advantage, but if you see them increase their asking price, do you bump yours up a little anyway? Third, consumer demand is shifting, and not always in ways that are obvious or predictable or even bad. In times of economic precarity , sales of items such as lipstick and mini bottles of alcohol tend to go up. We're in a super-dynamic environment, given the uncertainty emanating from the White House and the global economy. In turn, it's a moment for a super-dynamic approach to prices. \"All of those dynamics, in this volatile environment, if you're thinking about it as a business, how do you thrive? How do you do better? You need to understand all of those things,\" Zawada said. \"That's where technology comes in. It's much easier now to have visibility on costs, see the reactions to the market, and then respond with prices.\" Customers recognize how volatile things are and may expect price changes. The willingness to accept these adjustments makes it easier for businesses to do some resets and expand their margins in competitive areas to get more breathing room. This is the type of margin-padding some companies did during this more recent episode of inflation . And if customers reject the increases, businesses can see that, too. Shikha Jain, the lead partner for consumer and retail for North America at Simon-Kucher, a business consultancy, said that determining the price of a good is a lot more than just picking a number. \"What does it do for consumer demand? How do we balance acquisition and retention? What does that mean for our internal balance sheet and cash flow in terms of our P&L,\" or profits and losses, she said, \"and what does it mean from a competition and market landscape standpoint?\" She pointed out that companies have gotten better at figuring all of this out in recent years, especially in the wake of a pandemic that was wildly disruptive to supply chains and consumer behavior across the globe. \"We haven't had a stable environment in a long time,\" she said. Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Consumers do not like dynamic pricing, even if it sometimes works to their benefit. Happy hour is dynamic pricing, as are early-bird specials, last-minute flight deals, and flash sales. But to many people, costs constantly moving up and down feels manipulative. They're suspicious it's going to actually work in their favor. It's also the case that dynamic pricing isn't really designed to handle what's happening now. It's usually about supply and demand \u2014 that Saturday night taxi being a much hotter commodity than the same one on a Sunday at 2 p.m. \u2014 not about whether the president of the United States will jack up the price of everything coming out of China. \"This is a completely different situation, where you are looking to government policy and how that could change very quickly and how you would change your prices in response,\" said Eric Greenleaf, a marketing professor at NYU's Stern School of Business who researches pricing. Businesses that sell online can change prices quickly, or just ride the wave of the Amazon algorithm. Some supermarkets and big box stores, such as Walmart, now have digital price stickers that can be adjusted in real time. Consumers are likely to be somewhat understanding that companies aren't having a good time with tariff-by-tweet. One risk businesses face in using slick dynamic pricing tactics, however, is that customers may view it as a little too slick. To blunt any backlash, they may want to pass the buck a bit. So the next time you go to the grocery store to pick up your favorite coffee brand, and it seems pricier than you remember, maybe there's a little asterisk next to the price tag that reads, \"*This price increase was brought to you by President Trump, not me.\" Whereas tariffs can change rather quickly, consumer optimism takes longer to recover. \"There'll be a lot of firms, and this is easier online, where they can literally say: 'Here's what we wanted to charge you. Here's the tariff. Here's the total price that you're paying,'\" Greenleaf said. \"Of course, that will probably upset the Trump administration, but businesses want to make clear that they're not profiting off of this.\" It's not that different from restaurants slapping on egg surcharges earlier this year. Were wholesale eggs more expensive ? Yes. Was it easy for customers to wonder whether they were justifiably 50-cents-an-egg-at-Waffle House more expensive? Also yes. But Zhang, from Wharton, said a tariff surcharge may be a better way to go for businesses than plugging tariffs into whatever pricing algorithm. They can take it off once the tariffs go away, and it's easier to calculate than whatever incremental adjustment happens across the supply chain. Plus, he said, \"You can just blame Trump.\" Not knowing who's to blame is, of course, part of the problem from a consumer perspective. And just because tariffs go away and companies cool it on all the price changes doesn't mean the sour taste it's left in people's mouths will fade so fast. \"Whereas tariffs can change rather quickly, consumer optimism takes longer to recover,\" Greenleaf said. Consumers are exhausted. The past five years have been filled with upheaval, and the chaos feels unrelenting. It's understandable people just want their shampoo to cost whatever it costs, no games. But the economy is increasingly gamified, including on pricing, whether or not people want to play.

This report looks at the different procurement methods companies can use when adopting renewable energy. Over 400 of the world's largest companies have committed to transition fully to renewable electricity, with 278 of these aiming to achieve their target on or before 2030. There are multiple ways companies can buy renewable energy. Each comes with its own challenges, and some can leave corporate buyers open to accusations of greenwashing. Key Highlights On-site generation is the most robust procurement method but has extremely high upfront costs. On-site generation refers to producing energy at the site where it will be consumed. This is an expensive procurement method, as it has high upfront and maintenance costs, but it guarantees 100% renewable energy (RE100) for a company's facilities. This method is best suited for companies with a low number of facilities or large corporations with the capital to invest in new power plants. Power purchase agreements (PPAs) are becoming more popular. PPAs are long-term contracts between a clean electricity generator and a customer. PPAs may last up to 25 years, during which time the buyer purchases energy at a pre-negotiated price. High credit requirements make PPAs most appropriate for companies that can guarantee continuous energy demand over a long period of time. Supply contracts are the more suitable option for smaller enterprises without the opportunity for on-site generation. This report analyzes renewable energy procurement methods, including on-site renewable generation, power purchase agreements (PPAs), supply contracts, and energy attribute certificates (EACs).It also evaluates the main challenges to renewable energy procurement, including oversupply, price pressures, and skyrocketing demand. Understand why companies need to adopt renewable energy. Access the different methods of renewable energy procurement. Identify which energy procurement method is most appropriate for your company.

Washington, United States: Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. Defining the market A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

The authentication token is also used to pull any images from a public repository on the Amazon ECR Public Gallery. Amazon ECR Public troubleshooting - Amazon ECR Public Issue: When performing an unauthenticated pull from an Amazon ECR Public repository, you receive an authentication token expired response. This is likely due to the fact that you've previously requested an authentication token from Amazon ECR Public and that token has expired. When the new Amazon ECR Public image pull is performed, the expired token is used and the error is received. The following is an example error. Error response from daemon: pull access denied for public.ecr.aws/registry_alias/repository_name, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login': denied: Your authorization token has expired. Reauthenticate and try again. Resolution: To resolve this issue, you can either re-authenticate to Amazon ECR Public or you can log your Docker CLI out of the Amazon ECR Public registry and re-attempt your unauthenticated image pull. docker logout public.ecr.aws Share this article \u30bb\u30df\u30ca\u30fc \u4e00\u89a7 \u4f1a\u793e\u8aac\u660e\u4f1a \u4e00\u89a7 \u52c9\u5f37\u4f1a \u4e00\u89a7 \u95a2\u9023\u8a18\u4e8b Terraform\u3067\u69cb\u7bc9\u3057\u305fVPC\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9\u30dd\u30a4\u30f3\u30c8\u306eDNS\u540d\u304c\u7121\u52b9\u3067\u3001ECS\u304b\u3089ECR\u3078\u306e\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u53d6\u5f97\u3067\u3064\u307e\u3065\u3044\u305f\u3053\u3068 sora 2025.04.09 \u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\u4f7f\u7528\u3057\u305fLambda\u306eTerraform\u30c6\u30f3\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30c8\u3092\u8003\u3048\u3066\u307f\u305f \u304f\u308d\u3059\u3051 2025.03.31 \u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30a4\u30ba\u3057\u305fSageMaker Distribution\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30ca\u30a4\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u306e\u4f5c\u6210\u30d1\u30a4\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u3092GitHub Actions\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3059\u308b nayu.t.s 2025.03.18 [\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8] Amazon ECR \u304c\u30d7\u30eb\u30b9\u30eb\u30fc\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u5148\u3068\u3057\u3066\u65b0\u305f\u306b Amazon ECR \u3092\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f \u305f\u304b\u304f\u306b 2025.03.13 \u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30e1\u30bd\u30c3\u30c9\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e \u4e3b\u306a\u30ab\u30c6\u30b4\u30ea AWS AWS\u7279\u96c6 Amazon EC2 Amazon S3 Amazon RDS Amazon VPC AWS Lambda AWS Fargate AWS IAM \u304a\u3059\u3059\u3081 Google Cloud \u30bb\u30ad\u30e5\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3 Notion Python LINE PM \u30c7\u30b6\u30a4\u30f3 \u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af \u30d7\u30ed\u30c0\u30af\u30c8 Auth0 Looker Tableau Alteryx Snowflake Proflly SumoLogic \u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4 \u30bb\u30df\u30ca\u30fc DevelopersIO\u3068\u306f RSS \u304a\u554f\u3044\u5408\u308f\u305b DevelopersIO\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 AWS\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u3054\u76f8\u8ac7 \u8cc7\u6599\u8acb\u6c42 \u30bb\u30df\u30ca\u30fc\u304a\u77e5\u3089\u305b\u30e1\u30fc\u30eb \u63a1\u7528\u60c5\u5831 \u4f1a\u793e\u8aac\u660e\u4f1a \u904b\u55b6\u4f1a\u793e AWS\u7dcf\u5408\u652f\u63f4\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9 \u4f1a\u793e\u6982\u8981 \u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9 \u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30d0\u30b7\u30fc\u30dd\u30ea\u30b7\u30fc \u30af\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc\u30dd\u30ea\u30b7\u30fc \u00a9 Classmethod, Inc.

Depends on the LG model, but right off bat the LGs have screen burn in issues. This can be a problem if you watch a lot of sports or have kids that leave the TV on all the time. If you mostly watch movies and things that don't leave images on screen for extended periods of time like score cards, menus, or heads up displays like sports, DVDs, and video games do then you should be ok. The blacks are almost always much blacker on LGs though. In all fairness I haven't researched TVs in a hot minute but I do remember Samsungs typically having more vivid colors. LGs are very solid though all around.

The singer was joined by Bezos's fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, who said a highlight of the flight was hearing Perry sing Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\". After landing back on Earth, Perry said she felt \"super connected to life\" and \"so connected to love\". The flight lasted around 11 minutes and took the six women more than 100km (62 miles) above Earth, crossing the internationally recognised boundary of space and giving them a few moments of weightlessness. Also on board were former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn. The New Shepard rocket lifted off from its West Texas launch site just after 08:30 local time (14:30 BST). The capsule returned to Earth with a parachute-assisted soft landing, while the rocket booster also landed back in Texas. Cheering could be heard from inside the capsule as the recovery crew went to collect them. Jeff Bezos opened the capsule door to welcome back Lauren S\u00e1nchez, the first to disembark. \"I'm so proud of this crew,\" she said tearfully. \"I can't put it into words.\" She paused, before adding: \"I looked out of the window and we got to see the moon.\" \"Earth looked so quiet,\" she said, adding that it was not what she expected. \"It was quiet, but really alive.\" Next out was Katy Perry, who kissed the ground and lifted a daisy to the sky - her daughter is called Daisy. Dave Limp/Blue Origin Gayle King also got on her knees and kissed the ground. \"I just want to have a moment with the ground, just appreciate the ground for just a second,\" she said. The last to get out, Kerianne Flynn, pointed at the sky and shouted: \"I went to space.\" A celebrity cast had watched the launch from the ground. Speaking from the viewing platform, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian said: \"I didn't realise how emotional it would be, it's hard to explain. I have all this adrenaline and I'm just standing here.\" \"Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age. Dream big, wish for the stars\u2014and one day, you could maybe be amongst them,\"\u200b she added. Oprah Winfrey spoke about her friend Gayle King, and revealed she was a nervous flier. \"I mean, for her\u2014whew\u2014anytime we're on a flight, she's in somebody's lap at the slightest bit of turbulence. She has real, real-world anxiety when it comes to flying. And this... this is her overcoming a wall of fear,\" she said. The spacecraft was fully autonomous, requiring no pilots, and the crew did not manually operate the vehicle. The last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space on a solo mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 6. Since then, there have been no other all-female spaceflights but women have made numerous significant contributions. The space tourism industry is still in its infancy, so every successful launch is significant and demonstrates that these short, commercial flights can be carried out safely. Getty Images The New Shepard rocket lifted off against the backdrop of the Van Horn hills, and lasted around 11 minutes But some critics stress it is tourism, not space science, and professional astronauts undertake missions, including scientific research, for the benefit of humankind. \"A celebrity isn't an envoy of humankind - they go into space for their own reasons,\" Dr Kai-Uwe Schrogl, special advisor for political affairs at the European Space Agency, told BBC News. \"These flights are significant and exciting, but I think maybe they can also be a source of frustration for space scientists,\" he added. \"We see space flight as being for science, knowledge and the interests of humanity. \"Celebrities do it for amusement but get a lot more attention than the regular astronauts.\" The space flight also generated a range of response on social media, from enthusiasm to hostility. Dr Tanya Harrison, from the Outer Space Institute experts network said: \"A lot of the comments that I saw on social media were things about, 'Oh, it's like the Real Housewives go to Mars' or 'It's the oligarchy in space, read the room, the timing is terrible.'\" But: \"There were a lot of positive takes as well. People were like, 'Oh, this is so cool. Katy Perry is going to space.'\" Dr Harrison, who had previously worked on Nasa missions to Mars said: \"The cynical part of me wants to call it a marketing stunt. This is a company promoting the fact they can launch tourists into space.\" However she noted the all-women team might \"change the demographics a little bit of who might want to do something like this.\" \"Socially, they might have had some impact\", she said. In a news conference after the flight, two of the women took issue with some of the criticism the mission had received, related for example to its cost. \"I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,\" said Gayle King. She said that the astronauts had had a huge, positive response from young women and young girls. Lauren S\u00e1nchez said she had got \"fired up\" about the criticism and would love to have the naysayers come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees who \"put their heart and soul into\" the missions. Blue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon. Although Blue Origin has not released full ticket prices, a $150,000 (\u00a3114,575.85) deposit is required to reserve a seat\u2014underlining the exclusivity of these early flights. Alongside its suborbital tourism business, the company is also developing long-term space infrastructure, including reusable rockets and lunar landing systems. The New Shepard rocket is designed to be fully reusable and its booster returns to the launch pad for vertical landings after each flight, reducing overall costs. According to US law, astronauts must complete comprehensive training for their specific roles. Blue Origin says its New Shepard passengers are trained over two days with a focus on physical fitness, emergency protocols, details about the safety measures and procedures for zero gravity. Additionally, there are two support members referred to as Crew Member Seven: one provides continuous guidance to astronauts, while the other maintains communication from the control room during the mission. The rise of space tourism has prompted criticism that it is too exclusive and environmentally damaging. Supporters argue that private companies are accelerating innovation and making space more accessible. Professor Brian Cox told the BBC in 2024 : \"Our civilisation needs to expand beyond our planet for so many reasons,\" and believes that collaboration between NASA and commercial firms is a positive step. Rocket engine exhaust contains gases and particles that can affect Earth's climate and ozone layer. On its web page under the title \"Protecting our Planet\" Blue Origin claims: \"During flight, the only byproduct of New Shepard's engine combustion is water vapor with no carbon emissions.\" However, Eloise Marais, a professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Quality at University College London points out that water vapour too is a greenhouse gas and is a chemical that is not supposed to be in the upper layers of the atmosphere. \"It alters the chemistry of the stratosphere, depleting the ozone layer, and also forms clouds that affect climate,\" she says. Experts say that as more rockets are launched, the risks of harming the ozone layer increases. High-cost tourism The high cost of space tourism makes it inaccessible to most people, with these expensive missions out of reach for the majority. Critics, including actress Olivia Munn, questioned the optics of this particular venture, remarking \"there's a lot of people who can't even afford eggs,\" during an appearance on Today with Jenna & Friends.

They have carefully enriched the digital experience, contributing to multi-billion dollar success. Thousands of banks and Fintechs try to tap into the same principles. In this article, we\u2019ll uncover 13 iconic UX innovations from the world\u2019s top tech giants\u2014and show you exactly how to adapt these brilliant insights for financial services. Because if a single tap can revolutionize e-commerce, just think what it could do for your financial brand. Let\u2019s dive in. Of course, the rise of AI is transforming the world and the way we interact with digital services, making its integration into future banking solutions all but inevitable. Yet, many banks and financial institutions still haven\u2019t adopted the very digital innovations that have already proven their worth in the world\u2019s largest tech companies. You will likely recognize the 13 user experience (UX) innovations featured in this article; most of us use them daily. These innovations were central to the success of multi-billion-dollar tech corporations\u2014yet they\u2019re surprisingly underutilized in financial services. How can banks and Fintechs leverage these proven UX strategies to transform generic copycut products into unique experiences that increase user engagement, build trust and increase key business metrics? Historically, the banking industry has struggled with a reputation for complexity and formality. However, today\u2019s consumers expect the same frictionless and rich experiences they enjoy in e-commerce and digital entertainment. Advanced banks and Fintechs are discovering that even small design tweaks can translate into major gains in customer satisfaction and revenue. Applying 13 Iconic UX Innovations to Financial Services Below are 13 widely cited examples of interface adjustments\u2014such as refining a single button or streamlining the onboarding process\u2014that drove significant improvements in both business outcomes and user experience. While they may appear modest, these best practices solve pressing user needs and have already become the standard across digital products in multiple industries. At UXDA we refer to this with our \u201cdopamine banking\u201d approach: using UX design to create micro-rewards and positive emotional triggers that keep users engaged, satisfied and returning to digital financial service. The core idea is that seemingly minor updates to enrich user experience can deliver remarkable returns in customer adoption, engagement and gained revenue. Dopamine, frequently called the \u201cfeel-good\u201d neurotransmitter, is released when users perceive rewards or positive outcomes. By aligning UX choices with these reward mechanisms, financial institutions can guide user behavior while raising overall satisfaction. Because these UX techniques have gained amazing results in the world's top digital services, a lack of them can place your product at a competitive disadvantage. Let\u2019s explore how these small but powerful interface design enhancements can generate unexpectedly large benefits for financial services: 1. One-Tap Actions Example: Amazon\u2019s \u201cOne-Click\u201d Checkout Instead of requiring users to fill in shipping and payment details repeatedly, Amazon introduced a single-click purchase flow once the user\u2019s information was saved. Drastically reduced cart abandonment by removing friction. Demonstrated how investing in a single, streamlined flow could transform the entire experience. \u201cOne-Click\u201d became one of Amazon\u2019s competitive advantages, credited with boosting conversion and recurring orders. Why It Matters: Eliminates friction: Streamlined workflows for common banking transactions (e.g., paying bills or sending peer-to-peer transfers) reduce dropout rates. Boosts engagement: Customers who see banking as fast and convenient are more likely to open and use the app frequently. Creates loyalty: By removing repetitive tasks, banks can delight users with near-instant, secure transactions. Implementation Tips: After user identity verification (via Face ID or a PIN), provide a single-button action: \u201cPay This Bill\u201d or \u201cSend $50 to John.\u201d Offer a short confirmation step for high-value transactions to reassure users. Dopamine Trigger: Instant Gratification: When users pay a bill or send money with a single tap, they receive immediate feedback (\u201cPayment successful!\u201d), which provides a quick sense of accomplishment. That momentary success can release dopamine as the brain recognizes a goal was achieved with minimal effort. Reduced Friction: Fewer steps mean fewer opportunities for friction, which can dampen positive emotion. The simpler the flow, the clearer the reward path. Emotional Effect: Users feel empowered and in control because they accomplished a meaningful task (paying a bill, making a transfer) with little friction. This positive emotional signal can reinforce future usage. 2. Minimalist First Screen Example: Google Search\u2019s Simplified Homepage From the earliest days, Google maintained a minimalist homepage, focusing on a single search bar and little else. Over the years, they\u2019ve retained that simplicity, carefully avoiding clutter. The clean, simple interface helped users find what they needed faster, becoming a hallmark of Google\u2019s brand. Lightning-quick load times enhanced user satisfaction, keeping Google as the world\u2019s leading search engine. This design choice arguably paved the way for \u201cless is more\u201d in modern UI design. Why It Matters: Reduces cognitive load: Users can find critical information (e.g., balances, upcoming payments) at a glance. Improves speed and learning curve: A clean screen with fewer elements typically loads faster, which boosts app performance ratings and is more intuitive for newcomers. Enhances brand clarity: Simple design conveys confidence and modernity, often associated with trust and authority. Implementation Tips: Make the landing screen highly focused: show only key balances, upcoming payments and a primary action (e.g., \u201cSend Money\u201d or \u201cPay Bill\u201d). Hide or tuck away secondary features, ensuring the main page remains uncluttered. Dopamine Trigger: Visual Clarity and Calm: Overly cluttered dashboards can trigger anxiety and reduce attention, blocking the potential release of dopamine associated with navigating something clear and intuitive. Sense of Mastery: A minimalist dashboard that focuses on top tasks gives users a sense that they know exactly where to go\u2014mastery itself can be rewarding and can produce small dopamine hits. Emotional Effect: Users feel relieved and confident rather than overwhelmed. This sense of calm clarity helps them trust the app, making them more open to exploring other features. 3. Personalized Suggestions Example: Netflix\u2019s Seamless Auto-Play and Personalization Netflix introduced auto-play of previews and next episodes, along with a dynamic UI that personalizes title images and recommendations for each viewer. Substantially increased viewer engagement and watch time by reducing friction (no more manual browsing). Encouraged binge-watching behaviors, driving up retention and subscription renewals. Reinforced Netflix\u2019s image as a data-driven, user-centered streaming platform. Why It Matters: Creates relevant user journeys: Contextual nudges like \u201cYou could save $X by refinancing\u201d or \u201cTry our new savings plan\u201d resonate more when tailored to the user\u2019s financial profile. Increases product uptake: Users are more inclined to explore new features or products when prompted with concrete, personalized benefits. Builds advisory value: Over time, customers see the bank as a trusted advisor rather than a mere transaction processor. Implementation Tips: Provide contextual offers: \u201cBased on your spending behavior, you could save $X per month if you\u2026\u201d or \u201cYou have $Y available in savings\u2014would you like to explore investing?\u201d Use spending patterns or deposit trends to offer personalized suggestions. Employ simple infographics or progress bars to explain how each recommendation can benefit the user. Dopamine Trigger: Personal Relevance and Novelty: Unexpected or relevant suggestions (\u201cYou can earn 2% more interest!\u201d) provide a pleasant surprise, stimulating dopamine through novelty and perceived reward potential. Timely Interventions: Well-timed prompts (e.g., \u201cYou have $300 left this month\u2014why not set aside $50 in savings?\u201d) give the user a sense of immediate reward for taking a beneficial action. Emotional Effect: Users feel cared for by the bank, experiencing positive emotions from receiving relevant, seemingly tailor-made tips or deals. The bank shifts from a faceless institution to a helpful advisor. 4. High-Quality Visuals Example: Airbnb\u2019s Emphasis on High-Quality Photos Early on, Airbnb discovered that better photos drove more bookings. They made photo quality a prominent part of their listing creation and updated the platform UI to feature large, appealing images. Listings with professional photos earned more views and significantly higher booking rates. Simplified the user journey: travelers could more easily judge the property, which boosted trust and conversions. This visual-first approach became a core design principle for Airbnb, helping them scale globally. Why It Matters: Conveys professionalism: Clean, high-resolution images, intuitive icons and well-structured graphs reinforce the bank\u2019s credibility. Enhances feature adoption: Users are more likely to try budgeting tools, investment products or robo-advisory solutions if the interfaces look polished and easy to understand. Humanizes the brand: Featuring real customer support avatars or representative photos can reassure users that people are behind the scenes. Implementation Tips: Make all your service interfaces aesthetically pleasing, modern and consistently authentic to your brand identity. Replace generic stock images and icons with consistent, authentic illustrations and icons that reflect your brand identity. Ensure all charts and dashboards use clear color coding and labeling for quick comprehension. Use clear, confidence-inspiring illustrations and real images of your representatives or customer support teams. Provide visual dashboards for spending, savings goals or investment performance to reinforce transparency. Dopamine Trigger: Aesthetic Pleasure: Attractive, cohesive visuals can spark aesthetic appreciation, a subtle dopamine release when encountering good design. Emotional Safety: Seeing modern, clean dashboards and friendly illustrations can reduce stress and create a welcoming environment, making it easier for users to feel a small emotional \u201clift.\u201d Emotional Effect: Users experience greater trust and comfort, which is critical in finance. This emotional security can heighten positive user experiences and keep them coming back. 5. Streamlined Onboarding Example: Basecamp\u2019s Simplified Signup Flow The team behind Basecamp is famous for minimalist designs. One change they cite repeatedly is removing unnecessary fields in the signup process and clarifying each step of the workflow. Lowered the barrier to entry, leading to a jump in completed signups. Reinforced the brand\u2019s commitment to frictionless user experiences. Provided a template for many SaaS products that copied the \u201cless friction, more clarity\u201d signup ethos. Why It Matters: Shortens time to value: The faster users can open an account or apply for a loan, the sooner they\u2019ll start engaging with your services. Reduces abandonment: Fewer forms and clearer step-by-step instructions mean less friction and dropout. Enhances perception of modernity: Smooth digital onboarding sets your bank apart from clunky, time-consuming competitors. Implementation Tips: Use progressive forms: show only what\u2019s needed at each step (e.g., personal info, then ID verification, then income details). Integrate real-time validation to catch errors on the spot (e.g., incorrect ID format). Remove extraneous fields or combine them smartly. Dopamine Trigger: Progress Feedback and Small Wins: Breaking down account creation into manageable steps (with real-time feedback) gives the user multiple mini \u201cwins,\u201d each capable of sparking a dopamine release. Reduced Anxiety: A simpler process means less cognitive load, so users can be more receptive to the small emotional highs of completion. Emotional Effect: Users feel accomplished at each step instead of stressed or frustrated. This sense of steady progress encourages them to finish onboarding and remain engaged afterward. 6. Referral Prompts Example: Dropbox\u2019s \u201cGet Space\u201d Referral Prompt Dropbox made a small tweak to highlight their referral program\u2014offering extra storage if you invite friends\u2014more prominently within the app UI. Skyrocketed referral-driven account signups, becoming a core viral loop for Dropbox\u2019s early growth. Simple, unobtrusive calls to action resulted in widespread brand advocacy at a very low cost. Became a legendary example of how product-led growth can hinge on a few well-placed nudges. Why It Matters: Accelerates user acquisition: Referral programs encourage organic word-of-mouth expansion with minimal marketing spend. Increases loyalty: Existing customers get a \u201cwin\u201d when they successfully refer friends or family. Validates trust: People are more likely to trust a bank recommended by someone they know, which can amplify your brand\u2019s reputation. Implementation Tips: Make sharing easy: a simple banner or button in the app that lets users send a unique referral link or code. Offer tangible incentives like cash rewards, waived fees or bonus interest for both parties. Offer a simple in-app invite (\u201cRefer a friend to open a checking account and you both get $XX\u201d). Make the referral prompt a friendly, unobtrusive banner on the homepage or in user settings. Dopamine Trigger: Social Validation and Reward: Getting a bonus for referring a friend\u2014and knowing the friend also benefits\u2014creates a win-win scenario that triggers dopamine both through social approval and the tangible reward (like cash or bonus points). Positive Anticipation: Waiting to see if the referral converts is itself a mini thrill, and receiving the reward spikes dopamine upon success. Emotional Effect: Users feel valued by the bank and take pride in sharing a good product with friends. The reward structure cements loyalty and fosters a community feeling. 7. Progress Bar Example: LinkedIn\u2019s Progress Bar for Profile Completion Adding a visual progress bar and step-by-step guidance encouraged users to complete their profiles or any other applications. More complete profiles led to better matches and increased recruiter engagement and user satisfaction. Significantly boosted LinkedIn\u2019s key metric: time spent on the platform and networking success. Set a precedent for gamified \u201conboarding journeys\u201d now found in countless apps and services. Why It Matters: Encourages thorough KYC: Seeing a profile progress bar can nudge users to verify their address, upload identification or add income details. Improves overall service: A fully updated profile unlocks faster loan decisions, personalized advice and lower compliance risk. Adds a gamification element: Users experience a sense of reward when reaching 100% completion, increasing the likelihood they\u2019ll continue exploring the app. Implementation Tips: Introduce a visual tracker that shows how much of the user\u2019s profile is complete (e.g., address, ID documents, phone verification, etc.). Provide incentives: \u201cComplete your profile to unlock faster loan approvals or instant transfers.\u201d Show clear benefits at each milestone: \u201cAdd your employer to boost credit limit possibilities.\u201d Use celebratory micro-animations or badges when users reach a new completion level. Dopamine Trigger: Gamification and Achievement: Each incremental fill in the progress bar is a mini-achievement, which can consistently trigger small amounts of dopamine as the user edges closer to 100%. Clear Goals and Feedback: The brain loves clear goals with visible feedback loops\u2014hitting them translates into tangible reward signals. Emotional Effect: Users feel rewarded and motivated to complete their profile (or KYC steps), associating the banking app with a sense of accomplishment rather than dread. 8. One-Tap Feedback Example: Facebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d Button (and Reactions) Initially, adding the simple \u201cLike\u201d button offered a low-effort way to acknowledge posts. Later, other reactions (e.g., love, angry, sad, etc.) were introduced for more nuanced engagement. \u201cLikes\u201d quickly became a core social metric, encouraging users to engage with content. Reactions gave Facebook deeper data on user preferences and emotional responses. The small tweak of going from zero to multiple \u201creactions\u201d changed the way users share feedback, spurring increased interaction. Why It Matters: Ensures continuous improvement: Quick feedback loop helps the bank measure customer satisfaction on-the-go \u201cthumbs up or down\u201d or a 1\u20135 star rating. Customer-centered culture: Creates a culture of continuous improvement, powered by data-driven insights on customer satisfaction. Builds customer trust: Users see the bank is genuinely interested in their experience, not just the transaction. Implementation Tips: After a chat or call with customer support, show a one-tap feedback mechanism (like a thumbs up or 1\u20135 stars). Provide optional expanded reactions for more nuanced feedback (e.g., \u201cfast response,\u201d \u201cfriendly agent,\u201d \u201cissue not resolved\u201d). Instant experience rate request with optional fields for more details: \u201cPlease tell us why\u201d if the user gives a low rating. Sum up feedback in dashboards to identify trends and training opportunities. Dopamine Trigger: Instant Sense of Contribution: Providing a quick reaction or rating triggers a small psychological reward, as the user feels \u201cheard\u201d by the service. Social Mechanism: Positive feedback loops\u2014like a quick \u201cthumbs up\u201d for a helpful chat\u2014mirror social media\u2019s reaction mechanisms, each delivering micro doses of dopamine for both the user and the service agent (if they see high ratings). Emotional Effect: Users feel empowered and believe their feedback matters, building a stronger emotional connection and sense of loyalty to the institution. 9. Biometric One-Tap Payment Example: Apple iPhone\u2019s \u201cApple Pay\u201d One-Tap Checkout Apple seamlessly integrated \u201cApple Pay\u201d into the iPhone\u2019s core experience, allowing users to authorize payments with Face ID or Touch ID in just one tap. Eliminated friction: Removing the need to type credit card details or billing addresses significantly shortened the checkout flow. Boosted adoption: Partnerships with major retailers and apps helped \u201cApple Pay\u201d become a ubiquitous, go-to payment method. Strengthened ecosystem: The convenience factor kept users locked into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, reinforcing brand loyalty. Why It Matters: Frictionless transactions: One-tap or one-look authentication for financial transactions sets a new bar for quick, secure payments in banking apps. Increased user trust: Apple\u2019s strong privacy and security stance assures users that their sensitive data is protected. Future-proofing: As users grow accustomed to instant payments, banks that fail to offer similarly smooth experiences risk losing relevance. Implementation Tips: Biometric integration: Tie into the device\u2019s biometric security (Face ID, Touch ID) to reduce login friction and confirm transactions seamlessly. Enter Apple ecosystem: Present the Add Card to Apple Pay (or equivalent) button prominently in your app. Dopamine Trigger: Instant gratification: The speed and ease of paying with a tap or glance release small hits of dopamine associated with accomplishing tasks effortlessly. Security + convenience rush: Users get the dual reward of feeling both safe and efficient, reinforcing positive emotions. Emotional Effect: The marriage of security and speed makes users feel their bank is modern and protective, increasing emotional loyalty. 10. Recurring Personalized Discovery Example: Spotify\u2019s \u201cDiscover Weekly\u201d Personalized Playlists Spotify pioneered user-specific music recommendations with \u201cDiscover Weekly,\u201d a curated playlist updated each Monday. High engagement: Users often check the playlist regularly, boosting in-app listening time. Built habit loops: The anticipation of new, tailored songs each week fosters a loyal user base. Industry-defining: It became a blueprint for recommendation systems across music and media platforms. Why It Matters: Contextual insights: Banks can similarly offer spending insights or saving tips based on a customer\u2019s \u201cfinancial habits.\u201d Habit formation: Recurring personalized prompts (like monthly spending reviews) can keep users returning to the app. Deep user bonds: Showing you \u201cknow\u201d your customer\u2019s preferences builds trust and longer-term engagement. Implementation Tips: Weekly or monthly insights: Provide automated \u201cFinancial Snapshot\u201d playlists\u2014like recommended budgeting steps or relevant offers Data-driven personalization: Leverage machine learning on user transaction data to highlight products or services with the highest personal benefit. Easy discovery: Place these personalized recommendations front and center on the home screen or via push notifications. Dopamine Trigger: Novelty and surprise: Finding a new favorite song (or, in banking terms, discovering a new benefit) sparks a dopamine hit. Positive reinforcement: When suggestions prove helpful, users feel validated and look forward to more customized tips. Emotional Effect: Users feel recognized on an individual level, forging an emotional link with your brand. 11. Single-Tap Rides Example: Uber\u2019s One-Tap Ride Request Uber simplified ride-hailing to a single tap, automatically detecting location, matching a driver and processing payment in the background. Revolutionized convenience: Removing the need for phone calls, manual address entry or cash changed urban transport globally. Increased retention: Customers repeatedly chose Uber for the seamless experience over traditional cabs or slower competitor apps. Set user expectations: Ride-hailing is now synonymous with \u201ctap, ride, done.\u201d Why It Matters: Reduced friction = higher usage: In finance, simplifying complex tasks (like requesting a loan or splitting bills) can lead to more frequent user activity. Automation of details: Users appreciate not having to re-enter repeated data points, echoing the convenience of \u201cno-cash, no-hassle\u201d rides. Brand differentiation: A bank offering near-instant processes (e.g., quick loan approvals) stands out in a crowded market. Implementation Tips: Auto-fill data: For repeat transactions, pre-fill as many details as possible so users just confirm. Transparent process: Show real-time status updates (e.g., \u201cYour request is being processed,\u201d \u201cApproved in 10 seconds\u201d). Built-in payments: Keep the payment mechanism seamless within the app rather than redirecting to external portals. Dopamine Trigger: Immediate outcome: One-tap actions that instantly produce a tangible result (like calling a ride) reward the brain with a sense of competence. Predictability and control: Knowing exactly when the \u201ccar\u201d or result will arrive fosters calm satisfaction\u2014tiny dopamine bursts. Emotional Effect: Minimizing complexity helps users feel they\u2019re effortlessly in control of their finances, reducing stress. 12. Live Collaboration Canvas Example: Figma\u2019s Real-Time Collaboration Figma introduced live, multi-user editing in a design tool, allowing teams to collaborate in the same file simultaneously. Eliminated version chaos: No more \u201cv2-final-FINAL\u201d file versions. Everyone sees updates instantly. Supercharged productivity: Designers, developers and stakeholders communicate in one place, reducing the number of back-and-forth emails. Community effect: Shared templates and plug-in ecosystems flourished around real-time features, fueling word-of-mouth growth. Why It Matters: Transparent collaboration: In banking apps, real-time co-browsing with support agents or co-managing finances with family members can build trust. Instant updates: Shared budgeting tools or joint account management can show immediate changes, fostering teamwork. Modern user expectations: People now expect seamless, synchronized experiences\u2014bringing that to finance differentiates you from outdated, siloed systems. Implementation Tips: Multi-user features: Offer \u201cjoint account views\u201d in which spouses or business partners see real-time transaction updates and can add notes. Co-browsing support: Enable support reps to view a user\u2019s screen (with permission) to guide them through complex tasks. Notification system: Keep relevant stakeholders in the loop with instant push alerts or in-app updates on shared financial tasks. Dopamine Trigger: Synchronous collaboration joy: Seeing real-time input from others can be exciting and rewarding, sparking mini-dopamine boosts. Reduced friction in teamwork: A frictionless group experience fosters a positive emotional response and a sense of collective achievement. Emotional Effect: Shared ownership and trust provides real-time transparency to build trust among users and between users and the bank. Feeling \u201cin it together\u201d increases satisfaction. 13. Endless Personalized Feed Example: TikTok\u2019s \u201cFor You\u201d Infinite Feed TikTok\u2019s vertical feed quickly personalized videos based on watch time, likes and replays, hooking users into continuous viewing. Hyper-engagement: The algorithm\u2019s accuracy and infinite scroll keep users scrolling far longer than they initially intend. Viral content engine: Easy video creation plus mass distribution turned TikTok into a cultural phenomenon. Redefined short-form media: The \u201cFor You Page\u201d is now the gold standard for endless, highly personalized entertainment. Why It Matters: Contextual curation: Banks can adopt similar \u201cinfinite\u201d but curated feed concepts\u2014like continuously updated financial insights. User stickiness: Engaging, snackable content (short tips, quick budgeting wins) can keep users returning daily. Behavioral data: By analyzing user interactions, the bank can refine future recommendations, from loyalty offers to credit advice. Implementation Tips: Short-form updates: Provide quick, scrollable financial tips or \u201cstories\u201d (e.g., daily spending insights, saving challenges). Personalized content feed: Prioritize recommendations based on each user\u2019s spending patterns, goals and previous interactions. Easy shareability: Let users quickly share these insights or achievements with friends, echoing TikTok\u2019s social \u201cduet\u201d effect. Dopamine Trigger: Endless novelty: Rapid-fire personalized content can trigger repeated dopamine surges as each new \u201ccard\u201d or insight might bring value. Micro-rewards: Even a small, useful tip or motivational nudge can feel rewarding, encouraging continued scrolling. Emotional Effect: Users feel a slight \u201cthrill\u201d in checking what will come up next, building habit loops around financial literacy. Presenting financial guidance in an engaging feed reduces intimidation and builds a positive, exploratory mindset. Final Thoughts While banks and Fintechs must navigate strict regulations and prioritize robust security, interface innovations needn\u2019t be complex to succeed. A single button, a strategic piece of microcopy or a well-placed progress bar can guide user behavior, inspire trust and drive meaningful business results. In a digital world in which consumers can switch providers with a few taps, thoughtful design enhancements are paramount. By adapting proven UX patterns from retail, media and tech to the specialized needs of finance, banks and Fintechs can surprise and delight customers, creating enduring loyalty. Even minor changes\u2014like shortening forms or enabling one-step transactions\u2014can reduce user effort and boost satisfaction. Clear, streamlined interfaces also reassure users that their finances are secure. Psychological nudges, such as progress bars, rewards or urgency indicators, can further influence positive user behavior while distinguishing forward-thinking institutions from those clinging to legacy systems. By weaving small, gratifying user experiences into every step of the banking journey, financial institutions can harness the power of dopamine to boost user satisfaction and build deeper loyalty\u2014all while helping customers manage their finances in a more streamlined, empowering way. Whether it\u2019s removing unnecessary steps, adding a single button or surfacing the right information at the right time, these micro-optimizations often become major growth levers\u2014proving that small, thoughtful design changes can have an outsized impact on both user behavior and business metrics. Minimize friction: Just like in e-commerce or media streaming, faster and simpler interactions increase conversion and satisfaction in banking. Use microcopy and visual cues: Subtle text prompts, progress bars and well-chosen animations reassure users about the seriousness and security of financial actions. Personalization matters: Deliver the right suggestions at the right time\u2014be it a savings prompt or a referral link\u2014to dramatically increase uptake of financial services. Build trust: In finance, trust is paramount. High-quality visuals, clear confirmations and frictionless onboarding reinforce user confidence. Balance and Transparency: Overusing urgency tactics or \u201cdark patterns\u201d can erode trust. Ethical design focuses on helpful nudges rather than manipulative tricks. Sustainable Engagement: Dopamine-driven design should improve financial wellness and user satisfaction, not pushing impulsive actions. Long-Term Loyalty: Positive \u201cmicro-rewards\u201d around money management encourage recurring, long-term usage of your platform.

Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. WASHINGTON: Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. Defining The Market A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2024.

In 2025, its parent company, Alphabet, is a vast multinational technology conglomerate and one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. While much of Alphabet\u2019s growth was internal, it also added to its empire through shrewd acquisitions, including of Android, DoubleClick and YouTube. Since 1998, it has acquired at least 267 companies . Alphabet is a key player in many digital markets, including general search, browsers, online advertising, mobile operating systems and intermediation. Google Search, for example, is now the most widely used general search engine in the world. Globally, its market share has been at least 78% for the past 10 years . Unsurprisingly, antitrust agencies, whose task is to protect competition, have been taking a close look at Google\u2019s conduct and that of other tech giants. While having market power is not illegal if it is the result of a superior product, protecting such a position by means that are not meritorious is. A weekly e-mail in English featuring expertise from scholars and researchers. It provides an introduction to the diversity of research coming out of the continent and considers some of the key issues facing European countries. Get the newsletter! Google\u2019s conduct under scrutiny In recent years, there has been growing concern that Google may be using anticompetitive means to protect and extend dominant positions in core digital markets. In 2017 , 2018 and 2019 , the European Commission fined Google over \u20ac8 billion for abusing dominant positions in key markets \u2013 more than any other Big Tech company to date. A fourth investigation into Google\u2019s behaviour in the advertising technology market , in which the European Commission is likely to request structural changes to Google\u2019s advertising business, is nearing completion. The national competition agencies of the EU member states have also actively enforced EU and national abuse-of-dominance rules. Private antitrust class actions for damages are adding to Google\u2019s woes. In 2022, the EU enacted the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to create an additional tool for intervening against entrenched market power in core platform markets. The DMA regulates the behaviour of so-called gatekeeper companies, aiming to make markets more contestable for competitors and fairer for users. In September 2023, the European Commission designated Alphabet as a gatekeeper in no fewer than eight platform markets for the following services: Google Search, Google Maps, Google Play, Google Shopping, Google Ads, Chrome, YouTube and Google Android. Within days of the DMA\u2019s conduct rules becoming binding on Alphabet in March 2024, the European Commission opened the first noncompliance investigation to assess whether Google Search was continuing to treat Alphabet\u2019s own services more favourably than its rivals\u2019, and whether Google Play prevented app developers from steering consumers to other channels for better offers. For the Trump administration, EU rules amount to non-tariff restrictions The territorial scope of these rules is limited to services offered in Europe. They do not regulate how Google operates in the United States \u2013 this is subject to US antitrust law. Nonetheless, the European Commission\u2019s enforcement actions have provoked the ire of the current US administration. In February 2025, the White House issued a memorandum titled \u201cDefending American Companies and Innovators From Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties\u201d that takes issue with European antitrust and regulatory measures against US companies. According to the Trump administration, the EU\u2019s rules amount to non-tariff restrictions and unfair exploitation of US companies, and they interfere with American sovereignty. The memorandum stresses that Washington will not hesitate to impose tariffs and other actions necessary to mitigate the harm to the United States. According to the European Union, such actions would amount to economic coercion and interfere with its legislative sovereignty to decide under what conditions services are offered on European soil. In 2022, likely with the possibility of a second Trump presidency in mind, it enacted the so-called Anti-Coercion Instrument , which allows the European Commission to impose a wide range of \u201cresponse measures\u201d, including tariffs and restrictions on imports, exports, intellectual property rights, foreign direct investment, and access to public procurement. Such response measures could be imposed on US digital services. Potential for escalation The situation has the potential to further escalate the risk of a trade war between Europe and the United States. However, the dispute over tech regulation does not appear to be about substantive antitrust principles per se. In 2020, the US House of Representatives issued a bipartisan report stressing the need for the United States to address the lack of competition in digital markets and the monopoly power of dominant platforms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice subsequently brought antitrust lawsuits against all four companies, most of which are still pending. The Department of Justice filed two separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020 and in 2023 . In the first case, a Washington DC district court in August 2024 found Google guilty of violating section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and established that Google had attempted to protect its monopoly power in the market for general search through anticompetitive means. Judge Amit P. Mehta is now determining appropriate remedies, and the Department of Justice recently reiterated its request that the judge break up Google . The second US case against Google is still pending. The accusations in it are similar to those underlying the European Commission\u2019s ongoing investigation into Google\u2019s behaviour in the market for advertising technology. While the case was initiated during the Biden administration, it has not (yet) been shut down since Trump returned to power. It\u2019s also worth noting that the new head of the Federal Trade Commission has stressed that Big Tech is a main priority of his agency . There seems to be concern on both sides of the Atlantic that Google has been restricting competition. The crux of the discord, most likely, is that European regulators are telling US companies what to do \u2013 even if on European territory. Europe lacks equivalents to Big Tech The European Commission appears determined to keep enforcing its antitrust rules and the DMA. On March 19, 2025, it informed Alphabet that its preliminary assessment had shown that Google\u2019s behaviour in search and in the Google Play Store was incompatible with the DMA. Also, the first noncompliance decisions against Apple and Meta under the DMA are expected shortly \u2013 even though the fines may well stay below the maximum 10% of a company\u2019s global annual turnover allowed by the act, in view of its novelty. Europe is not an insignificant market for Google and other US tech companies. In 2024, Google reportedly generated 29% of its global revenue, or $100 billion , in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Europe has no equivalents to Google or other Big Tech companies, and the EU today imports 80% of its digital technology . In September 2024, the Draghi Report issued a stark warning to bloc leaders, highlighting waning geopolitical stability and the need for Europe to focus on closing the innovation gap with the US and China in advanced technologies. Less than five months later, the European Commission published the Competitiveness Compass , a roadmap to restoring Europe\u2019s dynamism and boosting economic growth. Strong measures from the White House in retaliation for European antitrust and regulatory enforcement might just give this process additional impetus. President Trump cannot make European tech great again, because it never was great. But his policies may unintentionally help make it so.

We're not talking about casual scrollers dropping quick stars \u2013 we mean folks who felt so strongly about their purchase that they sat down and crafted whole testimonials. Between cleaning supplies that turned skeptics into evangelists and luggage that has travelers writing poetry in the review section, these finds don't just sell well; they create devoted followers who can't help but spread the gospel. Getting 40K people to agree on anything feels like herding cats, yet here we are. Whether it's meat thermometers preventing kitchen disasters or car cleaning gel inspiring people to write reviews longer than their college essays, each product earned its massive following through pure, consistent excellence. From handheld fans turning summer survivors into cooling converts to car jump starters saving enough stranded drivers to populate a small city, these aren't just popular items \u2013 they're verified victories backed by an army of satisfied customers who couldn't keep quiet about their discovery.

Adams initially backed Trump\u2019s tariffs but later exposed inflated figures, arguing the real issue is U.S. consumerism\u2014Americans prefer buying goods over manufacturing them. Nations like China and Singapore are ditching the dollar, with ASEAN countries urged to prioritize regional trade, accelerating the decline of U.S. financial dominance. Adams forecasts skyrocketing food prices, homelessness, and violent crime as the dollar collapses, warning the U.S. faces global economic isolation. Adams urges immediate investment in physical gold and silver, predicting fiat currencies will fail, and endorsing Peter Schiff\u2019s hyperinflation warnings. In a fiery broadcast on Brighteon Broadcast News, Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, issued a stark warning: President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff policies are accelerating a global economic decoupling that could plunge the United States into financial ruin. Adams argues that Trump\u2019s miscalculations\u2014including misleading claims about foreign tariffs\u2014are destabilizing international trade and pushing nations like China, Singapore, and ASEAN members to abandon the U.S. dollar. The fallout, he warns, could include hyperinflation, mass poverty, and supply chain breakdowns. The Tariff Sheriff\u2019s Reckoning Adams opened his April 14, 2025, broadcast with a satirical song titled Trump the Tariff Sheriff, mocking the president\u2019s hardline trade policies. But the tone quickly shifted to alarm. \u201cTrump breaks the world,\u201d Adams declared, likening the collapse of U.S. dollar hegemony to Humpty Dumpty\u2019s irreversible fall. The first critical fracture, Adams noted, came in 2022 when Western nations froze Russian assets, signaling that foreign reserves in dollars or euros could be seized at will. The second shock arrived with Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, announced on April 2, 2025. Adams initially supported the tariffs, believing Trump\u2019s claim that China imposed a 67% tariff on U.S. goods\u2014until he discovered the numbers were inflated. \u201cTrump\u2019s team calculated trade imbalances and called them tariffs,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie.\u201d The real issue, he argued, is America\u2019s insatiable consumerism: \u201cAmericans don\u2019t want to work in factories, but they do want to buy stuff made in factories.\u201d The Great Decoupling Adams pointed to Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister, who recently delivered a scathing critique of Trump\u2019s policies, urging ASEAN nations to prioritize regional trade and ditch the dollar. China, meanwhile, is anchoring an alternative financial system, backed by gold reserves and bilateral currency swaps. \u201cThe U.S. is going to be embargoed by the entire world,\u201d Adams warned. \u201cCountries are cutting the ropes\u2014they won\u2019t let America drag them down.\u201d He predicts skyrocketing food prices, rampant homelessness, and a surge in violent crime as the dollar collapses. Gold as the Last Lifeline Adams\u2019 most urgent advice? Buy physical gold and silver\u2014now. \u201cIf you don\u2019t own precious metals, you will be financially wiped out,\u201d he said, dismissing fiat currencies as \u201cgoing to zero.\u201d He endorsed Peter Schiff\u2019s Crash Proof 2.0, which forecasts hyperinflation and a dollar collapse, and urged listeners to stockpile tangible assets. His grim conclusion: \u201cTrump is conducting a controlled demolition of the U.S. economy.\u201d Whether by design or ignorance, the result is the same\u2014a world abandoning America, leaving its citizens to face the consequences alone.

The \"Firework\" and \"California Gurls\" singer will be lofted more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) above the Earth's surface in a vessel from Blue Origin, the space company owned by the Amazon founder. Five other women including Bezos' fiancee Lauren Sanchez will join the flight, slated to blast off from western Texas at around 8:30 am (1330 GMT). Their fully automated craft will rise vertically before the crew capsule detaches mid-flight, later falling back to the ground slowed by parachutes and a retro rocket. Monday's mission is the first all-female space crew since Valentina Tereshkova's historic solo flight in 1963. It is also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered the space tourism experiences for several years. The company does not publicly communicate the price of trips made possible by its New Shepard rocket. Lasting around 10 minutes, the flight will bring the passengers beyond the Karman line -- the internationally recognized boundary of space. There will be a brief period when the women can unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity. Perry recently told Elle magazine that she was taking part \"for my daughter Daisy,\" whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, \"to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams.\" \"I'm just so excited to see the inspiration through her eyes and the light in her eyes when she sees that rocket go, and she goes back to school the next day and says 'Mom went to space',\" Perry added. Perry, launched onto the international stage with her 2008 hit \"I Kissed a Girl,\" will sit alongside TV presenter Gayle King, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA scientist Aisha Bowe and Amanda Nguyen, founder of a campaign group against sexual violence. They follow 52 previous Blue Origin passengers, including longtime \"Star Trek\" leading man William Shatner. Such high-profile guests are intended to keep public interest in Blue Origin's work, as it battles multiple rival firms in the space tourism field. Bezos' top challenger in passenger flights is Virgin Galactic, which offers a similar sub-orbital experience. But Blue Origin aims in future to bring space tourists into orbit, competing directly with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In January, Blue Origin's much more powerful New Glenn rocket successfully completed its first unmanned orbital mission. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2024. All rights reserved.

Facebook X LinkedIn Copy to Clipboard Copy North America Analysis Economy Technology World Tech tariff trainwreck: Mad King Donald backflips on the backflip Can you backflip on a backflip after another backflip? That\u2019s what Donald Trump has done with his \u2018exemption\u2019 for computer equipment. Bernard Keane Glenn Dyer Apr 14, 2025 4 min read Share 0 US President Donald Trump (Image: ABACAPRESS/Matias J. Ocner) The working rule for any major announcement by Donald Trump is that it will be reversed, modified or dismissed as never having happened within a matter of days. And that appears to apply as much to the reversals and modifications themselves. So that tariff backflip revealed on Friday (not the initial backflip, to reduce tariffs to 10% for everyone other than China, but the backflip to exclude semiconductor chips, smartphones and laptops made in China from the-nearly 150% tariffs on China) which was widely seen to have saved the bacon of Apple , given its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, turns out not to be an exemption at all. There will instead be a specific tech tariff, the administration said yesterday. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019,\u201d Trump raved . \u201cThere was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019 The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d The additional tech tariffs won\u2019t be revealed for one to two months, presumably giving the administration time to cobble together an equivalent to the kind of irrational, innumerate mathematical model it used to work up its now-ditched \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 1202161 Trump wants allies in his war on China. Albanese and Marles will bend the knee \u2014 as will Dutton Bernard Keane 139 Friday\u2019s electronics backflip-that-wasn\u2019t was disseminated not via a White House PR stunt but a US Customs and Border Protection Service notice to shippers, which contained a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes, retroactive to 12.01am EDT (3.01pm Sydney time) on Saturday, April 5. Reuters reported that the notice \u201clisted 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays\u201d. That still leaves billions of dollars worth of kitchen and other households goods, toys, foodstuffs, machinery, car parts and similar products still paying the 145% China tariff. Big companies like Walmart, Target, Tesla, Ford, GM, Stellantis and their customers all face a sharp rise in costs and prices. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when it committed to invest US$500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. It similarly pledged a US$350 billion investment during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. This time the exemption took days to appear, and investors sold Apple shares down heavily as they speculated it would be the most impacted from the tariffs of all the tech heavies. That saw the market value of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms \u2014 slump US$2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2. Trump\u2019s latest move will add to the belief among investors and in bond markets that his administration has injected a permanent sense of uncertainty into US economic policy. Who can plan investment with any certainty when the price of key inputs can double on the whim of an irrational ignoramus? And if the goal of the tariffs remains both to generate massive revenue to fund Trump\u2019s tax cuts and force the onshoring of all manufacturing to the US in a form of modern-day autarky, where will the US get the skilled workers needed, given Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4%? Certainly not migration \u2014 under Trump, the US is now overly hostile to visitors of any kind, let alone people who might want to consider offering their skills to US employers. He also seems to have undermined, at least for the medium term, confidence in the safe haven status of the US and its bonds, which is what caused the initial tariff backflip last week. The Federal Reserve (hated by Trump because of its independence) stepped in on Friday with well-timed comments aimed at bond market investors. Boston Fed president Susan Collins told the Financial Times that the US central bank would \u201cabsolutely be prepared\u201d to deploy its various tools to help stabilise the financial markets if the need arose. You know confidence in US bonds and the country\u2019s credit worthiness is shot when a senior member of the Fed has to go public to emphasise that the central bank will be there to clean up the mess Trump is making. But Treasury yields remained elevated over the weekend at 4.482%, reflecting that Trump\u2019s volatility is materially adding to the risk of what was until recently the crucial safe haven of global finance.

After opening toasted sesame oil should be tightly capped refrigerate and use within 6 months. It is a condiment, a post-cooking finishing oil not a cooking oil.

However, the idea is more about levelling the global playing field by building a much more open, collaborative stack. Francesco Bonfiglio, CEO of cloud exchange platform Dynamo, an Italian cloud services company, says EuroStack\u2019s all about teaming up to create a European tech ecosystem alternative, including cloud. The concept answers a new wave of protectionist practice and sovereignty concerns that have increasingly come to the fore worldwide. \u201cWe need to do something. We understand the importance of digital infrastructures, and cloud in particular, as a new strategic infrastructure for the economy, societies, politics and democracy in general,\u201d Bonfiglio tells Computer Weekly. The hegemony of giant tech firms, often in the US, has continued to loom larger. In cloud, this is signified by the growing dominance of hyperscalers \u2013 especially Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft and Google. Of course, the power of Silicon Valley stems in part from capital investments over decades that cannot today be easily replicated. However, that\u2019s not to say nothing can be done. What is EuroStack? A EuroStack pitch document came out in January 2025 which notes that 2024\u2019s Draghi competitiveness report identified that a failure to take \u201cfull advantage of the digital revolution\u201d is a key cause of Europe acquiring an \u201ceconomic laggard\u201d status. An industry-driven initiative, EuroStack therefore seeks to develop an integrated digital ecosystem, with an entire value chain encompassing software, services, hardware and solutions. According to the 100 or so organisations involved so far, the IT environment has become \u201cfundamentally extractive, with data and economic rents appropriated through unfair bargains between super-dominant providers and us, the dependents\u201d. A growing body of laws and regulations representing \u201cmultiple attempts\u201d at competition intervention have failed \u2013 and slowed home-grown companies further with compliance demands. \u201cFurther, the \u2018occupation\u2019 of spaces is massively accelerating as US hyperscalers are aggressively marketing AI tools and services as key to European growth and prosperity,\u201d it says. The topline objective is to boost security, redundancy and resilience, opportunities, sovereignty and governance through direct industry action, bottom-up rather than top-down. This should be supported by five policy pillars: Recognise and define a European digital industrial policy (EDIP) across European commission functions. Build strategic digital infrastructures, first by aggregating \u201cbest of breed\u201d existing assets and supporting them with integration platforms, then by increasing industry collaboration. Support this aggregation with public and private investments, including in costly parts of the value chain. Select aligned interventions and measure results in terms of business outcomes that drive economic autonomy. Seek cooperation with third-party states that share common goals. A successor to Gaia-X In a sense, EuroStack appears a successor to a more or less stillborn Gaia-X . Bonfiglio says the Gaia-X concept had \u201cthe political message\u201d but less of a clear action plan. One key for EuroStack is ensuring organisations and consumers trust digital services and platforms. Technological quality and innovation is available in Europe, if not always adequately commercialised. Also, many remain nervous about data handling, privacy and intellectual property (IP). \u201cWe need to make that simple,\u201d Bonfiglio says. \u201cWe need transparency, controllability and interoperability. And if you want to lock me in, I won\u2019t let you in.\u201d Cloud federation has to go beyond technical federation too because no single operator will invest in becoming interoperable with another without related business opportunities. Concretely, cloud services providers Aruba, Ionos and Dynamo have just introduced the Sovereign European Cloud API (SECA) as a best-in-class industry standard for cloud infrastructure management. The next requirement is for potential customers to be able to find the European solutions they need. Bonfiglio says providers all over the world can and perhaps should build their own version of EuroStack, even organisations from the US itself: \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be hostage to these three private companies either.\u201d Cloud infrastructure services investment globally is still growing. Canalys reported 20% year over year to Q4 2024 and similar for 2025. However, 64% of that total spend is on AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Bonfiglio estimates that European providers have less than a 10% share of the market \u2013 and that share is shrinking, with most European datacentre capacity already either owned or rented by hyperscalers. \u201cIn 2028, hyperscalers will likely control 75% of our datacentres. It\u2019s an application of ancient colonisation techniques \u2013 only now it\u2019s not tea plantations but GW and square metres,\u201d says Bonfiglio. \u201cBut we can start to change this now, leveraging our existing assets.\u201d Change will be tricky \u2013 what is the best way? Nicky Stewart, senior adviser at the Open Cloud Coalition, retains doubts regarding strategy. After all, managing change across 27 member states remains \u201cincredibly complex\u201d. Regulation needs harmonisation, or even strengthening, and addressing competition could be simpler, she suggests. \u201cCertainly the hyperscalers have become all-powerful in technology; there\u2019s been fast growth, enormous concentration, and, if you like, anti-competitive business practices,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cBuyers don\u2019t always want the homogeneous, one-size-fits-all answer when it can be better provided with better customer service \u2013 and often keener pricing \u2013 by other cloud providers.\u201d Stevenage-based cloud services provider Civo is also a member of the Open Cloud Coalition. Chief commercial officer Simon Hansford adds that options are needed, with digital sovereignty entailing differential data handling. Some data is far more important and private. The way you handle, store and share it should recognise that. \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t travel abroad, but that we put more economic value on it,\u201d adds Hansford. EuroStack as it is envisaged would better recognise the value of data and related industries. If you do not have sovereignty over a given resource, you control how you drive value. \u201cA clear example might be Airbus. Europe decided to build its own aircraft, rather than becoming a manufacturing site or maintenance site for Boeing, which would have been very easy to do,\u201d says Hansford. Today, this appears to have been a good decision. Without recognition of value, it can be very difficult to develop a local ecosystem \u2013 from education, training and certification to OEM \u2013 that drives jobs and businesses beyond indirect sales and services. \u201cThe majority of Europe\u2019s cloud professionals are in sales, marketing, pre-sales engineering and the like. AWS and Microsoft might say they\u2019ve got 1,000-2,000 people in the UK, but if they\u2019re all pre-sales, there\u2019s no research or core engineering done there,\u201d Hansford points out. \u201cWe have got to start creating demand by moving money away from the hyperscalers into our local industry.\u201d Solange Viegas Dos Reis, chief legal officer at French infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) provider OVHCloud, points out that Amazon, Microsoft and Google have power that extends beyond cloud as well. \u201cThey have more and more power, and use that to strengthen what they have in other markets too,\u201d she says. OVHCloud has signed up. With EuroStack, business and industry have finally understood the direct impact that politics, and indeed geopolitics , can have on economics, she says, adding: \u201cWe need to get rid of dependencies on other countries where the political pressure can have a direct effect on us.\u201d Freedom of choice and innovation might be achieved by having a more open provider or by developing some smaller stacks with collaborative interoperability and transparency, with \u201cgood strategic partners\u201d from outside the EU also involved. She notes that when your data is hosted on hyperscaler servers, there is a risk that your activity competes with one or more of theirs, because they are so large and dominant. Or that it can be accessed by other governments for reasons with which you would not agree. Data and digital sovereignty is about more than competition. \u201cEuroStack makes me hope that we may go faster and be more precise on the needs,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s quite ambitious, for sure, but it\u2019s driven by economics, business and industry, and with strong leaders. It\u2019s not just a couple of lawyers in the room trying to make more regulation.\u201d Tackling the issues with regulation, top down, has not worked so far. Of course, it\u2019s a challenge, not least because it involves companies from diverse sectors up and down tech stacks. And there will likely be resistance from some. \u201cWe must coordinate everyone and identify the common challenges and elements,\u201d Viegas Does Reis says. \u201cBut the objective will benefit all the world, the whole tech ecosystem.\u201d Mark Neufurth, lead strategist and programme manager for SECA at cloud services provider Ionos, agrees that EuroStack models an initiative that could benefit organisations worldwide, and that is important. \u201cWhile there\u2019s no [actual EuroStack progress] development as of now, Europe has to develop a \u2018target picture\u2019 in the light of current politics, which are changing fast,\u201d he says. \u201cOtherwise, we will be out of business in a matter of years in terms of digitisation and digital things.\u201d That\u2019s all while the hyperscalers are still coming to, for instance, Berlin or wherever to take advantage of local innovation, Neufurth adds. Meanwhile, EuroStack has seven layers and takes a \u201chuge work package\u201d to get it off the ground. Software, hardware and services must be defined, resourced and built. Local problems, including potential inertia, must be overcome. That said, there are already European designs for low-energy chips here, and the cloud API standard SECA , so that should all help, Neufurth says. Of course, economies of scale must be developed. Other organisations, in other countries, can and should develop similar initiatives, including the UK \u2013 but partnering is key. Overall, however, the vision will take years, even decades, to materialise, Neufurth adds. \u201cNonetheless, we need this. It\u2019s essential that we emancipate ourselves a bit from China and the USA,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there\u2019ll be less of a single point for failures, and of course better competition.\u201d Read more about competition in the cloud market CCS Insight\u2019s Bola Rotibi looks at the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s plans to regulate the public cloud.

Cell C is the fourth-largest mobile network operator in South Africa, , after Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom. The company founded in 2001 offers prepaid and postpaid mobile plans, data bundles and internet services, fiber broadband, roaming and international calling, SIM-only plans and device deals. Cell C has confirmed a data breach following a RansomHouse cyberattack that occurred last year. The ransomware group has since leaked the stolen data on its dark web leak site. The gang claimed the theft of 2 TB of data. Compromised data includes full names, contact details, ID numbers, banking information, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical records and passport details. Cell C stated that threat actors gained unauthorized access to some of its IT systems. \u201cCell C is aware that data compromised in the recent cybersecurity incident has been unlawfully disclosed by RansomHouse, the threat actor claiming responsibility.\u201d states the company . \u201cThis follows a previously reported incident involving unauthorised access to unstructured data in some parts of our IT environment.\u201d Cell C has taken swift action to contain a recent cyberattack, secure its systems, and limit the impact. The company engaged top cybersecurity and forensic experts, informed authorities, and is actively supporting affected stakeholders. They continue to monitor for potential data misuse and urge vigilance against fraud, phishing, and identity theft. Cell C has also shared fraud prevention resources, including guidance on registering with SAFPS for extra protection. RansomHouse is a data extortion group that has been active since Dec 2021. Unlike other extortion group, the gang doesn\u2019t encrypt data, but focuses on data theft to speed up its activity. Victims include AMD and Keralty. They shame non-payers by leaking data. Backups are insufficient; IPS is recommended for protection. American hospitals are a privileged target for threat actors due to the huge trove of sensitive data they manage. Ransomware attacks on U.S. healthcare providers surged in 2024, with 98 attacks compromising 117 million records . Hospitals often face system lockdowns, forcing a switch to manual processes. High-profile breaches include Change Healthcare (100M records), Summit Pathology (1.8M), OnePoint Patient Care (796K), and Boston Children\u2019s Health Physicians (909K). In 2023, Loretto Hospital experienced another data security incident . On January 19, 2023, a former employee misappropriated security camera footage of a limited number of patients and posted it on Facebook. The footage was removed after the incident was discovered. Loretto identified the impacted individuals and notified them by mail on March 15, 2023, offering guidance on protecting their information. The exposed information consisted of security camera footage of a small number of patients.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 01:26am EDT Share Save Comment Amazon's new agentic AI system, \"Nova Act,\" is set to transform how we interact with technology in ... More our homes, potentially outperforming competitors from OpenAI and Anthropic. Adobe Stock The next wave of AI transformation will be driven by agents . Rather than simply asking questions or following prompts, these AI tools will carry out complex tasks and act with far more autonomy. This will change a lot of things as we become able to delegate more and more tasks to machines. By connecting with external applications, agents can take care of shopping, scheduling, managing travel, and many of our day-to-day interactions with digital services. Amazon has long been on a mission to bring AI into the home, and the sound of Alexa\u2019s voice is familiar around the world (even if it has been reported that she\u2019s mostly used as a very overpowered timer.) With homes increasingly filled with smart gadgets, agentic AI clearly has the potential to further streamline the way we engage with technology in our homes. However, Amazon\u2019s plans are likely to go further. Here\u2019s what we know about them so far and a look at what it could mean for smart homes of the future. What Is Nova Act? Amazon recently became the latest of the AI giants to unveil their own agentic AI model, called Nova Act. Similar to ChatGPT Operator, it can take control of a web browser and use it to do many of the same things we can do. MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, April 15th WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades On April 14, 2025 Before WrestleMania 41 When you think of how many day-to-day activities we use apps on our phones for, it becomes clear how big the impact of this on our lives could be. According to Amazon, Nova Act is capable of booking trips, completing online purchases and managing calendars and to-do lists. One difference between Nova Act and competing agentic platforms like Operator is that the technology will be built into an upcoming upgrade to Alexa . This could potentially be amazing, with home AI assistants becoming much more useful. Of course, there would be some fairly sturdy privacy guardrails in place for technology like this that could potentially gather very intimate details of our day-to-day lives. According to this TechCrunch report , Nova Act outperforms competitors, including tools from OpenAI and Anthropic, at some of the key tests used to rate agentic AI performance. Agentic AI Assistants Rival agentic services like Operator and Manus may be available (like Nova Act, they are research previews) but don\u2019t have this same potential backdoor into millions of homes. Popular voice assistants brought mainstream adoption for voice-activated computing, but they have been slow to integrate LLM technology of the type used by ChatGPT. After chatting to a voice LLM chatbot like ChatGPT, going back to trying to have a conversational user experience with Alexa (or Siri, or whoever) is frustrating. They\u2019re clearly far less good at holding a conversation or understanding nuanced commands. What they are good at, though, is working with an ecosystem of connected apps and services. By jumping to agentic, Amazon can make home assistants that are capable and conversational like ChatGPT but also have a framework for communicating and controlling external services, as Alexa and Siri can. We\u2019ve recently seen Apple integrate its Apple Intelligence platform into Siri in the hope it will lead to an \"iPhone moment\" for genAI-equipped handsets. Google is taking a slightly different approach, with its Gemini chatbot acting as a standalone voice AI rather than attempting to integrate with the existing Google Assistant. For the moment, at least. So it\u2019s clear that the big AI companies all think the time is right for us to start welcoming the next generation of agentic smart technology into our homes. But would that actually be a smart idea? The Pitfalls Of Agentic AI In The Home Agentic AI has the potential to be hugely transformational. And so there are some pretty big concerns that need to be addressed before we can be confident that society has an informed view of the risks and challenges. These include cybersecurity concerns. Whenever we integrate new technology, particularly into our homes, we need to be sure we aren\u2019t creating new vulnerabilities that can be targeted. Then there's the glaring issue of privacy. Concerns have long existed about how securely smart speakers protect the personal conversations they hear. With autonomous, always-active agents, the risk of privacy invasion becomes even greater. More generally, some people are concerned that becoming too reliant on AI for menial and routine tasks could lead to us becoming over-reliant and helpless, perhaps even to the detriment of human problem-solving or decision-making ability. We should also consider the potential ramifications of AI hallucinations . No one is really sure how the LLM chatbot's propensity to simply make things up will transfer and scale to an agentic, action-based system, but it\u2019s not difficult to predict that things could get messy. At the end of the day, though, I think it\u2019s inevitable that agentic AI will play an increasingly major role in our lives, including in the home. Amazon has as good a shot at making it happen as anyone, thanks to the market penetration of Echo and Alexa. But one thing that\u2019s certain is that with AI, everything is still to play for. In the near future, many more services and devices will offer agentic AI in the home as we start to get a better understanding of what it can do and how it can help us.

Posted on Apr 14, 2025 Subscribe to Shopping Newsletter Caret Down 28 Flowy Dresses You'll Basically Live In All Spring Now that the sun's social battery has recharged, it's time to stock up on maxis and midis. by Daniel Boan BuzzFeed Staff Facebook Pinterest Link Unless otherwise specified, all sizes in this post are listed in women's. 1. A flowy maxi with whimsical tied straps \u2014 it'll be your go-to dress for the influx of bridal showers you're currently getting invitations to. The bodice is nice and stretchy, while the tiered skirt will basically float around you as if you're carrying your own personal fan. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Such a cute and comfy dress! It has a fun flow to the bottom of it, and the ties for straps add an extra dose of fabulous.\" \u2014 Kelsey Krucker Get it from Amazon for $21.78+ (available in sizes XS\u20134XL and 14 styles). 2. A V-neck dress featuring an adjustable twist-tie waist that comes in several cute polka-dot and floral designs \u2014 which are inarguably the two most springy patterns of all. Bonus points if you tie the belt into an adorable bow. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"For me, clothes pay for themselves based on the number of compliments that are received when an item is worn. I already liked the dress the moment I put it on, but all day long women commented about what a lovely and pretty dress it is (ooh, I like the color, ooh it\u2019s so pretty, ooh, that dress looks like the start of a whole new wardrobe). The compliments made the reasonable dress price feel like a bargain deal. I guess I\u2019m a sucker for polka dots and the power of hearing something positive during the day.\" \u2014 Isadelle Mercedes Get it from Amazon for $35.99 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 19 colors). 3. A sleeveless number with a button-down design and tiered skirt if you're looking to put a unique semi-formal twist on the classic swing dress. Throw on some strappy sandals , grab a round rattan bag , and your official spring brunch 'fit is sorted. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I\u2019ve been buying lots of dresses on Amazon for an upcoming vacation, and this one hits the mark perfectly! ...This is sooo comfortable! AND it has pockets! The best part is that my husband was trying to be helpful and did laundry, and he washed and dried this dress and I found it smashed into the laundry basket three days later. Not only did it still fit, but it wasn\u2019t even wrinkled! Perfectly packable! Brb, gotta go buy all the other colors!\" \u2014 DiKat Get it from Amazon for $27.67 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 22 colors). 4. A short-sleeve button-up dress that's long and fluttery, yet lightweight and breathable, so you'll probably still be reaching for this in the fall. Reviewers say they've received tons of compliments when wearing it, and you may even feel like a \"fairytale princess.\" \ud83d\udc51 www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought this dress on a whim and was a little skeptical about it. I have never received so many compliments on a dress before. I wore it on a trip to the Biltmore Estate with my husband and in laws and we honestly couldn't get through the day without someone stopping me every few minutes to ask where I got my dress or to tell me how gorgeous it was. It flowed beautifully on that windy day. I'm obsessed with it, I even bought two more in different colors. I highly recommend!!!\" \u2014 Maria Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in sizes XS\u2013L and six colors). 5. An embroidered tulle dress so elegant and floaty it might make people curtsy or bow every time you enter the room. The vibrant floral embroidery is truly the epitome of spring, and the tulle will keep the skirt lightweight and airy as you flutter around like the spring fairy you are. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Note: Reviewers suggest having someone help you tie the corset lacing at the back. Some also say they had to adjust the straps for a more secure fit, so be sure to allow yourself time to make some alterations if necessary! Promising review: \"I don\u2019t ever write reviews but had to because this dress is literally EVERYTHING!! It\u2019s so pretty and the fabric is high quality. I just wish for more occasions to wear it!!\" \u2014 Norah Barnes Get it from Amazon for $59.99+ (available in women's sizes 0\u201328 Plus and in 13 colors). 6. An open-back design with a halter neckline and a fabulous floor-length cut I guarantee you'll twirl around in every 15 seconds. No worries if you get dizzy and need a break \u2014 the fabric is super comfy and lightweight enough to lounge around in. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have been wanting this same dress from a store in the mall, but it was $118. I was leery about this, considering it was much cheaper in cost, but it is PERFECT! It fit absolutely perfectly. Great length, too. Keep in mind you can't wear a bra with it, and if you are larger-busted (I'm small, an A cup), then it may fit totally differently. It's thin and lightweight, but with skin-colored undies, I had no problem with lines or visibility. I'm considering buying it in another color.\" \u2014 Bullitt02797 Get it from Amazon for $32.99+ (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 34 colors). 7. An off-the-shoulder smock dress so springy and adorable, you might be crowned this year's May Queen. But not in the creepy Midsommar way. Actually, a flower crown would pair quite nicely with this... go ahead and book that flight to Sweden!! Reviewers especially love the side slit that's not only super breathable but also gives you ample room to show off your latest sandal purchase. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review : \"Bought this for our couples beach photo session in Oahu and it was PERFECT!!! I received endless compliments whenever I\u2019ve worn this: to dinner, the farmers market, shopping\u2026anywhere and everywhere! The sleeves stay in place and don\u2019t ride up or fall down, very flowy. Buy two!!! You won\u2019t regret it! :)\" \u2014 Christi Get it from Amazon for $43.99 (available in sizes XS\u20134XL and 27 styles). 8. A short-sleeve pleated dress with the absolute best feature a dress can have \u2014 POCKETS! The wide variety of vibrant prints doesn't hurt, either. Reviewers note that while the fabric is breathable and spring friendly, it's still heavy enough to stay in place so a slip isn't necessary! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I absolutely love this dress. I bought it in another print after trying it out for a few weeks. It washes and dries perfectly . Good material and pockets!!! I get so many compliments on it, especially the polka-dot one I ordered after this one. They are so versatile, and I wear it all seasons. When it is warmer as is, and in the fall and winter, I layer with it.\" \u2014 Annie Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in sizes S\u20133XL and 28 colors). 9. A gorgeously floaty dress featuring a true wrap design, meaning you can customize it to your perfect fit. It's practically tailor-made for walking around barefoot on the grass. Like any good spring dress, reviewers say this one is super lightweight and never clingy. Amazon Promising review: \"This dress is absolutely gorgeous! I love that it is a wrap dress because you can customize the waist for how you would like it to fit. I was worried about it being too low cut (because I am large in the chest area), but it fits perfectly. I can wear a regular bra and I don't feel like I am showing too much cleavage.\" \u2014 Danielle Palermini Get it from Amazon for $45.99+ (available in sizes XS\u20132XL, two lengths, and five colors available in the calf-length style and 20 available in the ankle-length style). 10. An A-line dress with a wrap waist design that's perfect for any upcoming spring parties... even if that party is just you and your roommate sitting around drinking wine. Bonus: it's airy enough to stick around for all your summer BBQs as well! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"You won't be disappointed by this dress. It is good quality, the fabric is not see-through at all, and I LOVE having pockets! It washes well, the colors are vibrant and I went back to order more. This is perfect for casual shopping with cute sandals or the office.\" \u2014 Domestic Bliss Get it from Amazon for $24.49 (available in sizes S\u20132XL and 30 colors). 11. A black organza dress that would go perfectly with some Doc Martens if you like to wear all-black for spring \u2014 which even Miranda Priestly would consider quite groundbreaking. Pair it with a plain black slip and TA-DA! You just found the perfect spring dress with zero floral prints or pastel colors in sight. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I use this with a simple silk undergarment of the same color...From being a beach coverup for a casual and refreshing dress for the hotter days. Size up if you have bigger arms or large breasts as it doesn\u2019t have any stretch to it at all.\" \u2014 Joan Espinoza-Gonzalez Get it from Amazon for $25.99 (available in sizes XS\u20133XL and four styles). 12. A casual-chic cocktail dress featuring gorgeous lace detailing at the waist for an extra dainty touch. It'll definitely be one of those \"excuse me, where did you buy that?\" dresses. No judgment if you decide to gatekeep it. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I was nervous about ordering online without trying on first, but BOY did it pay off. The decorative band around the middle is not at my waist. It's slightly above my waist, but not so high as to be a princess waist (right below the bust)... The skirt is all the way to the knee but not below it, so it's conservative enough to wear to a cocktail party... but also fun and twirly enough to wear out dancing (which is what I got it for). Am now looking for more dresses by this company!!!\" \u2014 GHBeckwith Get it from Amazon for $31.99+ (available in sizes 4\u201312 and 26 colors). 13. A maxi dress with a skirt so voluminous you'll be tempted to fling it from side to side every time you walk. The linen and cotton blend fabric keeps things airy and lightweight, while the long sleeves are perfect for these early days of spring when the sun needs to recharge its social battery every few days. Any Size / Etsy Promising review: \"Gorgeous dress! So generous in material. Perfectly sewn! Thank you for excellent service!\" \u2014 shirleysullivan Any Size is a small business that makes beautiful tailored garments to fit up to 6XL! They recommend dry-cleaning this dress, but just look at it \u2014 it's so worth it. Get it from Any Size on Etsy for $38.60+ (available in sizes S\u20136XL and three colors). 14. A mini shift dress that has a breathable v-cut neckline and back, so you'll immediately reach for it once the sun is finally out in full force (signaling an official ~shift~ away from leggings season!). Also, the shade on the left is called \"olive martini,\" which would be the perfect accessory. Preferably on a trendy rooftop bar with a nice stranger who offers to take pics of you and your friends when they see you struggling to take a group selfie. Impressions Impressions is an Arkansas-based woman-owned boutique serving up stylish apparel that can fit your budget. Get it from Impressions for $52 (available in sizes S\u20133XL and in navy and olive \u2014 not all sizes available in both colors). 15. A bohemian print dress \u2014 it feels like your favorite nightgown but looks trendy enough for an impromptu photo shoot when you spot the flower wall at that new restaurant that's blowing up on TikTok. Oh, and the elastic waistline will keep you comfy all day long. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This dress is super cute! Material is soft and lightweight; the fit is loose and flowy. Perfect throw-on dress for summer in Florida, but cute enough to wear to brunch or dinner.\" \u2014 Lauren Carlucci Get it from Amazon for $37.99 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 31 colors). 16. A short-sleeve dress so cute, you'll be tempted to wear it on a weekly basis. You'll feel dressed up enough for an important meeting, but you won't mind lounging around in it once you get back home. The material is a lovely mid-weight fabric, so prepare to pull this back out when the early days of fall come around. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Material is light, but I love that I can wear a slip, tights, and a cardigan in the fall or winter to make this dress last year-round. Great buy!!!\" \u2014 FOUR UR Review Get it from Amazon for $31.98 (available in 14\u201326 Plus and 39 colors). 17. A ridiculously cute dress with a stretchy high-waisted design that's so comfortable you might still reach for it on your work-from-home days. It also has a unique bow-tie neckline and ruffled sleeves to help it stand out from the rest of your go-to dresses. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I needed a dress to easily pack in my suitcase that was no-iron or fancy treatment needed after the suitcase. This was for a dinner with my boyfriend's family and I was meeting them for the first time. It was such a hit. Of course, right out of the package you see it and think, 'hmmm is this too cheap looking?' but it seriously looks great on and I dressed it up with tights. I wore the other color to my boyfriend's work party. It\u2019s a great no-fuss dress that packs and wears easy.\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $33.89 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 24 colors). 18. Or! A similar knee-length flared sundress , but this one has a unique buttoned skirt design that comes in so many different color combinations. You could pretty much just buy one for every day of the week and have a much more stylish version of a spring work uniform. www.amazon.com Several reviewers say this runs true to size! Promising review: \"This is dress is prefect for work, casual events, etc. I absolutely loved it and it\u2019s really comfy. The material is soft and not too heavy but heavy enough. I reside in Arizona and it\u2019s prefect for the summer! A lot of people confused it for a skirt, so I think of it as two outfits in one.\" \u2014 Robert G. Get it from Amazon for $31.90 (available in sizes S\u2013XL and 10 colors). 19. A popular maxi dress with short sleeves but a super long length, making it perfect for those transitional days when it's way too warm for a jacket but not quite hot enough for shorts. And I truly meant it when I said this is popular \u2014 it's impressed over 10,000 Amazon reviewers so far! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This dress is lightweight enough to wear in warmer weather, and I'm looking forward to wearing it with tights and a long cardigan well into cooler months. A blank canvas to accessorize as you like with long necklaces, boho bracelets, a wide-brimmed hat. Looks great with sandals, probably cute with snow boots. All around a versatile, staple piece. I imagine it'd be great for capsule collections. I live with a dog who sheds fur furiously (ha), and I was easily able to shake his fur out of the dress and still go out in public.

Quechua farmer Anacleta Mamani inside her greenhouse in Poques, in Peru\u2019s Cusco region, where she practices agroecological farming as an alternative to face the effects of climate change. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS LAMAY, Peru, Apr 14 2025 (IPS) - \u201cUp here in the highlands, there\u2019s a lot of frost, and everything seems bleak. But I\u2019m so happy since I got my greenhouse and started growing vegetables in a healthy way. I feel like we\u2019re overcoming the challenges of the weather,\u201d Anacleta Mamani, a Quechua farmer from the community of Poques (about an hour\u2019s drive from Cusco, the former imperial capital of Peru), told IPS. Poques is one of 13 farming communities in the municipality of Lamay, located nearly 3,000 meters above sea level in the province of Calca, in the southeastern department of Cusco. Like much of rural Peru\u2019s Andean highlands, the area faces persistent poverty and neglect from the national government\u2014a disadvantage worsened by the climate crisis. This South American country of 34 million people is highly vulnerable to climate change, even though its greenhouse gas emissions account for less than 1 percent of the global total, according to a 2021 measurement by Peru\u2019s Environment Ministry . The ministry, citing figures from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), reports that around 5.5 million Peruvians are exposed to floods and another 2.6 million to droughts. Among the most affected are family farmers, as they depend on natural resources\u2014particularly women, due to gender inequalities that limit their ability to respond. \u201cBefore, we only grew potatoes, corn, and quinoa for daily sustenance. Now we also have a variety of vegetables we didn\u2019t even know how to eat before. With the techniques we\u2019ve learned, we\u2019re better equipped to face the climate crisis, which is hitting us hard,\u201d said Mamani, one of 120 families in her community, located in Cusco\u2019s Sacred Valley, known for its landscapes and traditions. She is one of 80 women farmers taking part in a training project led by the non-governmental Flora Trist\u00e1n Peruvian Women\u2019s Center , aimed at developing their farming skills to confront climate change while increasing their participation and decision-making in community organizations. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that the first step is working the land\u2014digging up to 60 centimeters deep and loosening the soil so it can breathe. Otherwise, the plants die even if you water them. That\u2019s the first good agroecological practice we\u2019re applying in the greenhouses,\u201d Mamani explained proudly. In four municipalities in Cusco, in the Andean highlands of southeastern Peru, greenhouses aim to enhance the agricultural skills of women engaged in family farming, helping them better cope with the climate crisis. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS Agroecology in Daily Life A Quechua speaker born in Poques 59 years ago, Mamani has dedicated her life to farming and family work, never having the chance to attend school. Now, she feels vindicated as she enriches her ancestral knowledge as a student of the Agroecological School run by the Flora Trist\u00e1n Center with support from the Basque Development Cooperation Agency and Mugen Gainetik . \u201cFor a while now, rains, hail, and frost come at the wrong time and cause a lot of damage. Last year, the wind was so strong it flattened the cornfields, and we couldn\u2019t harvest anything\u2014just losses,\u201d she recalled, gesturing with her hands as engineer Janet Nina translated her words into Spanish for IPS. Peru\u2019s National Meteorology and Hydrology Service (Senamhi) reported that 2024 was the hottest year in the last six decades. The consequences included droughts and heavy rainfall, impacting areas like family farming, leading to crop losses and food insecurity. The 80 trained women farmers come from four districts or municipalities: San Salvador, Coya, Calca, and Lamay. Each has a 100-square-meter greenhouse equipped with a drip irrigation system, in which they\u2019ve also been trained for sustainable use. \u201cWe water just enough\u2014no more wasting water. I water my cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, lettuce, carrots, and tomatoes early in the morning before the sun gets too strong, because I have to walk a long way from my house to the greenhouse,\u201d Mamani said.

Her children Avelina and Ricardo Cruz (second from left and first from right, respectively), along with other family members, have embraced Mamani\u2019s teachings on agroecology to protect the environment and biodiversity threatened by climate change while also improving their daily diet. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS She also grows squash ( Cucurbita pepo ), beets, chard ( Beta vulgaris ), beans ( Phaseolus vulgaris ), and other vegetables, now a staple in her household diet. The surplus, which is growing, is currently bartered with other families in the community, but starting in May, she will also sell them in nearby markets, providing her with her own income. Through training, she also learned to make natural fertilizers. \u201cI save fruit peels, potato skins, eggshells, and all kitchen scraps, along with ashes from the stove, animal bones, and manure from chickens, sheep, and guinea pigs. We mix it all to make fertilizer that nourishes the soil, producing healthy, strong, and tasty plants,\u201d she shared. She passes this knowledge on to her family\u2014her husband, daughter, son, and their respective families. This dynamic is replicated by other women in the Agroecological School, spreading this climate-resilient farming method. \u201cIn my mom\u2019s greenhouse, there\u2019s a special climate. We can grow many vegetables and eat better. The crops are protected from weather extremes, and we can keep practicing agroecology, caring for our environment, our Pachamama (Mother Earth), and our water for future generations,\u201d said Avelina Cruz, 36, who learns from her mother alongside her husband and teenage daughter. Her husband works in Cusco city and returns on weekends to help apply what they\u2019ve learned. \u201cWe do it carefully because, as my mom says, the plants \u2018speak.\u2019 Protecting nature is our small way of preventing climate change from destroying us,\u201d Cruz said. Diverse vegetable production with an agroecological approach is being developed on the high Andean slopes of communities in southeastern Peru. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS Leading the Charge Sociologist Elena Villanueva, the project leader, emphasized the role of Andean rural women in the climate crisis. \u201cThey aren\u2019t responsible for this situation threatening food and water security and human health, yet they don\u2019t hesitate to take action,\u201d she told IPS in Cusco. She highlighted agroecology as a sustainable production model that helps restore ecosystems. \u201cIt\u2019s an alternative to industrial, extractive, monoculture-based farming, which worsens global warming and harms the well-being of rural women and families,\u201d she said. She warned that \u201cwe\u2019re at a critical moment where industrialized nations most responsible for climate change are backtracking on emission reduction commitments, ignoring the consequences for vulnerable populations.\u201d She urged national policies to prioritize family farming, which supplies nearly 70% of Peru\u2019s food. \u201cOur authorities must turn their attention to the countryside, promote agroecology, and close gender gaps,\u201d she demanded. In rural areas, women have less access to land, water, seeds, and other resources while bearing heavy workloads that hinder their leadership and political participation. The mayor of Lamay, Glicerio Delgado, criticized the Peruvian government for ignoring rural development demands, including proposals to expand greenhouses and implement water catchment projects as sustainable practices to address climate challenges. Credit: Mariela Jara / IPS Lack of Support Peru recognizes 55 Indigenous peoples \u201451 from the Amazon and four from the Andes, including the Quechua, the largest group, with nearly five million members nationwide, including rural-to-urban migrants. About 14 percent of Peruvians speak Quechua as their first language. Peru\u2019s 2017 national census was the first to include ethnic self-identification. Andean rural women are mostly Quechua and have inherited ancestral farming knowledge. But migration and shifting community dynamics have left some struggling to adapt to climate challenges. Traditionally, reading nature\u2019s signs guided farming, but this is no longer enough with current erratic weather and rain patterns. Women now face turmoil, which causes constant worry as family farming sustains their households. Lamay\u2019s mayor, Glicerio Delgado, expressed commitment to rural development and climate resilience but lamented the lack of national support. \u201cThere\u2019s much to do\u2014expanding greenhouses, building water catchment systems for family farming led by women. But so far the Ministry of Economy and Finance hasn\u2019t responded to our funding requests,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, in the four Cusco municipalities, Anacleta Mamani and her 79 peers will keep working to sustain their homes with agroecological practices, strengthening their resilience against climate extremes.

Social media juggernaut Meta is on trial on Monday. It faces serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission, the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world\u2019s third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\u201d As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \u201cIt would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\u201d Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook\u2019s 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram \u2014 then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. EXPLAINER: Understanding Trump\u2019s tariff policy \u2014 and what it means for Nigeria Ecuador reelects incumbent Daniel Noboa as president How to boost economic growth \u2013 Agbakoba An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram\u2019s emergence as \u201creally scary,\u201d adding that is \u201cwhy we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\u201d The FTC argues Meta\u2019s $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta\u2019s defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta\u2019s apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta\u2019s monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience \u2014 with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. \u2013 Defining the market \u2013 A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta\u2019s market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe bigger that Meta can make the relevant market\u2026 the more likely it is to defeat the FTC\u2019s case,\u201d said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

Almost as good as the first one, did not like the fact you cant drive vehicles in this one. Otherwise, graphics game play and story is really good. Well worth it. 1 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Risenxone Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 6:10 PM 17 Posts Joined Dec 2013 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 6:10 PM Risenxone Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 6:10 PM 17 Posts Currently playing this on Xbox game pass and I'm really enjoying it 1 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Sign up for a Slickdeals account to remove this ad. dwong83 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:53 PM 28 Posts Joined Apr 2013 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:53 PM dwong83 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 8:53 PM 28 Posts Is this better on ps5 or xbox series x?

Assuming price is a factor for prospective buyers and you'd want all 3 of these movies, I can't imagine you'll ever get close to this price comparatively for the 4K versions. 2 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Related Searches Entertainment Movies Blu-ray & 4K Blu-ray Free Shipping with Prime Online Only Amazon $55 $70 21% off Levels Grass Fed Whey Protein, 5.64 lbs Double Chocolate or Vanilla Bean $54.99 shipped at Costco.com 6 There is no voting data on this thread You have chosen to downvote this deal.

It\u2019s embarrassing to have guests over because the toilets are so gross! I have tried so many products and cleaning solutions \u2014 from natural essential oils to harsh chemicals so strong I was lightheaded for the rest of the day. Well, I tried out this pumice stone after reading about it in a BuzzFeed article, and honestly the hype is real! It does take some elbow grease, but the after picture is from only 20 minutes of scrubbing, light enough that I didn\u2019t break a sweat! The stone does get used up, but I think this one should last me a couple of years at least. So if you have embarrassing toilets, try this! \" \u2014 Stephanie Ray Get it from Amazon for $9.26 (available in multiple pack sizes). 4.

This product does everything and more. Just ordered another round. We were about to throw away some furniture due to the smell, and now, after use, we can keep it. Saved me hundreds.

My fabric sofa is constantly covered in hair and I finally decided to try this after reading an article about popular TikTok products. The reviews do not lie, this thing works magic!! I wish I had taken a before and after picture because the difference is noticeable. I watched the video tutorial before I tried it to ensure I was using it properly and everything he says is true, you do really have to put your arm to work with vigorous back-and-forth movement!

I tried name-brand shower cleaners and bleach to try and clean the soap scum off the tiles and tub. I had no luck and I would cough and get sick because of how strong the smell was. I thought I would try this to save my lungs. I sprayed my entire shower and left it for about 15 minutes. I came back and rinsed off the walls and they were shiny! I've never had such a clean shower. The smell is amazing and subtle. All I smell is tea tree and it didn't affect me at all. The price is also a good deal since the bottle is pretty large.

It won't... so grab this and save the pipes from yourself! www.amazon.com Please note how hard I'm trying not to make a Super Mario Bros. plumbing joke right now. Promising review: \"Y\u2019all, this thing is amazing! My kitchen sink was completely clogged for four days. I\u2019ve been trying to clear the drain with a different sink plunger that I already had and it didn\u2019t do diddly squat. I was about to give up and call a plumber.

I've made so many different rices in it. The only thing I suggest is when making rice that might end up sitting in the pot for a while, put some olive oil on the bottom as the rice tends to stick if it's sitting on the 'warm' setting for too long, or add some extra water. The rice cooker is wonderful though. It's a real time-saver. \" \u2014 Michelle Get it from Amazon for $16.74+ (available in four sizes). 14.

After seeing the results, I couldn't help but spread the word. Sure, it took some beer, a little John Mayer, and a lot of elbow grease, but I got the job done, thanks to this handy little product.

I have a family of four and would frequently have to snake our shower drain, it appears I won't be having that problem ever again. I even give my dog baths and this collects the hair.

I tested the pump to see how well it works, and it worked perfectly! Works just as well as a vacuum, just takes a little more effort pumping out the air. Using these bags, I got half my closet back!

I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weeds was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it from Amazon for $39.97 . 27.

I think the intuitive, easy to use design is fantastic. We already have the muscle memory for using a spray can. In an emergency, it's so much easier to grab this and use it, and turn a small fire into a non-fire. I don't have time to remember a three step method of fire control when my bacon has gotten out of control on the stove. I'm not a firefighter! I'd really like to have one in every room. Think about it. Isn't it better to immediately contain a small fire than deal with a big one? This could save your life, and your house. \" \u2014 K. Zander Get it from Amazon for $11.99 . 32.

There was a lot of attention to detail put into the design and I particularly appreciate the wire inside the rim that holds everything steady \u2014 no more worrying about spilling all the liquid on the way to the freezer. Just a fantastic product all around. I purchased this and a cheaper version from another manufacturer at the same time but returned the other product. This one is definitely worth the added cost.\" \u2014 Kate Get it from Amazon for $19.95 (available in three colors). 33.

A reviewer in Edge highlighted the arcade releases as having both quantity and quality, and said the Atari 2600 games have held up less well and that the selection of Lynx and Jaguar games were mostly curiosities. I'll pass on this one. 2 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Drifta Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:11 PM 92 Posts Joined Nov 2023 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:11 PM Drifta Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:11 PM 92 Posts Switch version is also $20. All these ROMs are widely available for emulation as well. All you need is something like an Anbernic to emulate these games. Still, the convenience to play them on a modern console is nice. 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Slikku Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:26 PM 3,830 Posts Joined Apr 2004 Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:26 PM Slikku Yesterday Apr 14, 2025 12:26 PM 3,830 Posts Last July this collection was on Steam for under $4.

Omnia Studios Ltd. v. JD E-Commerce America Ltd., 2025 WL 961473 (W.D.N.Y. March 31, 2025) This case involves the service Joybuy, which listed items for sale in Walmart.com\u2019s marketplace. The plaintiff alleges that Joybuy sold counterfeit items, as confirmed by test buys. The court is unclear about how Joybuy operates, but it appears that Joybuy (via the entity \u201cJD\u201d) runs its own online marketplace. As a result, the Joybuy listings on Walmart.com are actually third-party merchant listings with Joybuy syndicated to Walmart. This ruling deals with the 512(c) defense. The plaintiff argued that Joybuy/JD did not qualify as a \u201cservice provider\u201d because it was the direct merchant. This is a rare attack on the capacious definition of a service provider, and it did not succeed. The court says that Joybuy sufficiently established that it ran its own online marketplace and thus qualified as a service provider. Shockingly, the plaintiff didn\u2019t contest any of the other 512 elements, so Joybuy defeats the lawsuit. The plaintiff argued that Walmart received direct financial benefits from the listings, so it is disqualified from the 512(c) defense. Rather than address that argument, the court does a switcheroo and says that Walmart doesn\u2019t have the right and ability to control the infringements. This switcheroo doesn\u2019t answer the question on the table, because the 512(c) defense requires the defendant to BOTH not have the requisite supervisory ability AND not have a direct financial interest in the infringements. Showing that Walmart satisfied one 512(c) defense element doesn\u2019t have any bearing on a different defense element. Still ignoring the question on the table, the court explains why Walmart lacked the requisite supervisory ability: Wal-Mart exercised little influence over the activities of its users. As the operator of the marketplace, Wal-Mart allowed users to take the lead on creating listings and thereby selling products\u2014including infringing ones. Wal-Mart\u2019s ability to remove infringing content does not grant it the right and ability to control, nor does its role in screening content as it was listed. The plaintiff also argued that Walmart had red flags of infringement because it was willfully blind. The court says that even if that\u2019s true, Walmart expeditiously removed the infringing items, typically \u201cwithin a day of receiving the complaint.\u201d The court gives Walmart some grace over the exceptions: Plaintiffs point to only a small number of listings that remained active for longer periods of time, but this seems to speak more to the technical difficulties involved in curating an online marketplace than a sign of willful blindness. As reported by Snukset, these lapses are attributable to glitches within Wal-Mart\u2019s automated takedown system\u2014Plaintiffs have not submitted evidence that satisfactorily disputes this. The plaintiffs also challenged Walmart\u2019s implementation of its repeat infringer policy because it didn\u2019t terminate JD. The court accepts Walmart\u2019s explanation: Snukset explains at length why Wal-Mart did not terminate JD or its marketplaces from Walmart.com: because Wal-Mart knew that JD was \u201cnot the actual source\u201d of the infringing products and did not create the listings themselves, that JD had a relatively low number of infringement complaints relative to market volume, and a \u201clack of evidence of prior notice of Plaintiff\u2019s IP rights.\u201d All of these constitute appropriate reasons why an ISP would refrain from terminating a user. Another act of grace from the court. Having a low number of infringement complaints still would sound like a recidivist to most courts. All told, Walmart gets summary judgment on the DMCA online safe harbor defense. I can\u2019t tell why the plaintiff\u2019s narrative fell so flat before this judge, but I don\u2019t know how repeatable this ruling is. The contributory trademark infringement claim against Walmart goes the same. \u201cThe evidence shows that Defendants were on-notice that their marketplaces contained infringing listings\u2014Plaintiff and their agents issued infringement complaints on dozens of such listings. In response to these complaints, however, the evidence shows that Defendants promptly took down nearly all of the infringing listings.\u201d As Miracle Max would say, \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between mostly removed and all removed,\u201d but this court treats them as equivalent. In a footnote, the court says: \u201cWal-Mart points out that Plaintiffs assert \u201crelatively small levels of infringing sales\u2014Chinn ($311.40), Collis ($2,195.28), Omnia ($170.01) and Turkey ($153.66).\u201d Plaintiffs dispute whether these constitute \u201crelatively small levels.\u201d\u201d Say what? This case involved less than $3k of total gross sales??? That seems like dubious grounds to go after a giant business like Walmart. After II Movie, LLC v. WideOpenWest Finance LLC, No. 1:21-cv-01901-DDD-CYC (D. Colo. March 14, 2025) This is a lawsuit against an IAP for subscriber-caused copyright infringement. The contributory copyright infringement claim survives a motion to dismiss when the plaintiffs allege \u201cthat WideOpenWest was notified of over 33,750 specific instances of direct infringement at over 13,000 of its IP addresses, including approximately 100 instances of specific infringements at several IP addresses, yet it did not investigate further or take any action to stop continued infringement by the subscriber accounts associated with those IP addresses.\u201d The IAP argued that Taamneh changed contributory copyright infringement, but that argument was rejected in UMG v. Grande (see also In re Frontier ). With respect to the vicarious copyright infringement claim, the court credits the following allegations: at least one subscriber continued using WideOpenWest\u2019s internet service because WideOpenWest is \u201camazing on torrents\u201d and the subscriber had \u201cnever gotten a letter or notice\u201d despite having \u201cdownloaded truly an outrageous amount of data.\u201d That subscriber recommended WideOpenWest to someone else looking for an internet service provider that is \u201c\u2018less\u2019 strict on downloading.\u201d (Note that nothing in that subscriber\u2019s testimonial refers to copyright infringement. The subscriber could have been celebrating their massive bandwidth consumption, not their massive infringement spree). As a result, the court accepted the inference that \u201ccopyright infringement was a draw for WideOpenWest\u2019s customers, and that WideOpenWest reaped some financial benefit, via attraction or retention of accounts, directly from its users\u2019 downloading and distribution of the plaintiffs\u2019 copyrighted works.\u201d As I\u2019ve mentioned many times before, treating IAPs as the deputy copyright sherriffs is bad news for the Internet. For more, see the linkwrap below. Maddry v. Luoxue, 2025 WL 822692 (N.D. Cal. March 14, 2025) The copyrighted work at issue in this case is a card game called \u201cDiscernment,\u201d which contains a deck of \u201cmade up of cards with biblical or funny Christian phrases\u201d that are garbled and need to be decoded. The copyright owner allgedly got flooded with Chinese knockoffs in online marketplaces that undercut his price. He complained to Amazon, which temporarily suspended the listings. Amazon said the listings would be restored unless he sued the knockoff merchants. He sued the online marketplaces pro se and sought an ex parte TRO for various remedies. His requests are all denied. The court says that it cannot bind the online marketplaces because they aren\u2019t defendants and thus are not reachable via FRCP 65. This goes straight to the heart of the SAD Scheme, where rightsowners keep getting TROs that purport to bind the online marketplaces\u2013seemingly lawlessly. The court says that 512(c)(3) takedown notices are supposed to provide the quick relief he seeks, and the court can\u2019t tell if he has availed himself of that procedure. This is a bit unfair to the plaintiff. 512(c)(3) is a way of disqualifying a defendant from the DMCA online safe harbor, but it\u2019s not mandatory that copyright owners send takedown notices to succeed in court. However, as a practical matter, courts have been skeptical when copyright owners sue intermediaries without trying 512(c)(3) notices first, and that appears to be the case again here. The court also says the plaintiff can discover the identity of the merchants through 512(h) subpoenas, so an ex parte TRO is unnecessary. That\u2019s true, but what about disclosures mandated in the INFORM Consumers Act? The court denies the plaintiff\u2019s request to enjoin the merchants from making listings because the complaint doesn\u2019t provide evidence of copyright registrations. An always-embarrassing mistake, even for a copyright owner proceeding pro se. Lopez v. Meta Platforms, Inc., 2025 WL 965811 (S.D.N.Y. March 31, 2025) Lopez claims copyright and trademark ownership of the \u201cNYC New York Cannabis\u201d logo: Lopez claims Meta and its users used the logo to promote the \u201cNYC Canna Cruise.\u201d The problem is that Lopez doesn\u2019t have a copyright registration in the logo because the Copyright Office refused it under its standard policy against registering logos. The unjust enrichment claim fails because it\u2019s preempted by the Copyright Act. The court doesn\u2019t give Lopez another chance to amend in part because \u201cLopez is a serial IP litigant who has filed at least 41 lawsuits in this District against more than 100 different defendants.\u201d Selected Posts About IAP Copyright Liability Internet Access Providers Face Contributory Copyright Liability for Subscribers\u2019 Infringements\u2013UMG v.

April 12, 2025 14:11 ET | Source: Whispeara Whispeara New York City, April 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hearing loss isn\u2019t just an age-related condition\u2014it\u2019s a growing global concern affecting people of all backgrounds and lifestyles. Whether it\u2019s the constant exposure to environmental noise, the long-term effects of earbud usage, or the slow, creeping impact of aging, millions are silently suffering. From asking people to repeat themselves to missing key parts of conversations, the frustration adds up. And for many, the problem isn't just hearing\u2014it\u2019s the emotional toll that comes with it. But there's hope. Whispeara can bring relief and restore the joy of sound. As social situations become more difficult and the feeling of isolation sets in, mental health can begin to deteriorate. Anxiety, fatigue, and even depression can follow when auditory clarity disappears. And while modern solutions like hearing aids promise quick relief, they often fall short of expectations. These devices can amplify sound indiscriminately, fail to address the root cause of the problem, and often come with a hefty price tag. Surgeries and prescription medications present another set of challenges, including high costs, risks, and side effects. That\u2019s why many people are turning to natural solutions\u2014remedies designed to support hearing from the inside out. But the wellness space is crowded, and not all supplements are created equal. Enter Whispeara , a powerful hearing support formula crafted with natural ingredients to help users experience sharper sound, reduced ringing in the ears, and stronger connections between the brain and auditory system. Whispeara stands out because it\u2019s designed to do more than mask symptoms. Its ingredients are strategically chosen to support overall ear health, nourish the auditory nerves, and help fight the inflammation and oxidative stress that contribute to hearing loss. With a growing number of satisfied users, glowing testimonials, and rising popularity, Whispeara is quickly being recognized as one of the best natural alternatives to traditional hearing solutions. Its effectiveness is undeniable, and it's time for you to experience it. In this in-depth review, we\u2019ll explore why hearing loss is becoming so common, what makes Whispeara so effective, how it works inside the body, what real users are saying, and how it compares to similar products on the market. By the end of this article, you\u2019ll have all the information you need to decide whether Whispeara is the right choice to restore clarity, confidence, and quality of life. Why You\u2019re Struggling to Hear \u2013 Understanding the Root Causes Before delving into the functionality of Whispeara, it\u2019s crucial to grasp the intricate nature of hearing loss and tinnitus. These are not simple mechanical issues of 'old ears,' as commonly perceived. The causes are multifaceted, ranging from neurological interference to cellular inflammation. Your ears often bear the brunt of a breakdown in communication between your brain, nerves, and auditory pathways. The Brain-Ear Disconnect One of the most overlooked causes of hearing problems is a breakdown in the brain\u2019s ability to interpret sound signals. Sound isn\u2019t just heard through the ears\u2014it\u2019s processed and understood in the brain. The brain plays a crucial role in not just receiving sound signals, but also in interpreting and making sense of them. Over time, due to aging, oxidative damage, or toxin exposure, this processing system can become sluggish or distorted. This is why many people with age-related hearing loss say they can hear sounds, but can\u2019t understand them. It\u2019s not a problem with loudness\u2014it\u2019s a problem with clarity. Whispeara plays a pivotal role in addressing this critical disconnect. It supports the neurological pathways that carry sound signals from the ear to the brain. By enhancing nerve communication, it has the potential to restore sharper interpretation of sound and improve speech comprehension in noisy environments. This offers hope for those struggling with hearing issues. Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Every day, your ears are exposed to oxidative stress caused by free radicals\u2014unstable molecules that damage cells over time. This damage affects the tiny hair cells inside your cochlea that are responsible for detecting sound vibrations. Once these cells are destroyed, they don\u2019t regenerate, making prevention and protection critical. In addition, chronic inflammation in the auditory system can reduce blood flow to the inner ear, choke off nerve endings, and hinder the repair of damaged tissues. Together, oxidative stress and inflammation form the silent villains behind progressive hearing loss. Many of the ingredients in Whispeara are rich in antioxidants and natural anti-inflammatory agents. These work to neutralize free radicals and support circulation to the inner ear, creating a more hospitable environment for sound transmission and nerve health. Environmental and Lifestyle Factors Daily habits can also accelerate hearing decline. Loud environments, constant earbud use, poor nutrition, smoking, unmanaged stress, and even dehydration can all compromise ear health. These factors can lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, and damage to the auditory system. Add in factors like earwax buildup, past infections, or exposure to toxins, and it becomes clear that hearing loss is rarely due to a single issue\u2014it\u2019s usually the result of a cascade of damaging influences. What\u2019s worse, the onset is often so gradual that many people don\u2019t realize how much they\u2019ve lost until it\u2019s too late. Conversations become harder to follow, high-pitched sounds vanish, and that faint ringing or buzzing sound\u2014tinnitus\u2014starts to become more frequent and persistent. Whispeara was meticulously developed with all these contributing factors in mind. Its comprehensive formula is designed to support the full auditory ecosystem. From cellular repair and nerve protection to circulatory enhancement and brain connectivity, Whispeara is a holistic solution that instills confidence in both prevention and recovery from hearing issues. Don\u2019t Wait\u2014Grab Whispeara Now for Natural Hearing Support What is Whispeara? A Full Breakdown of the Formula and Its Origins Whispeara isn\u2019t just another generic supplement on the market\u2014it\u2019s a precision-formulated natural hearing support formula designed to help restore auditory clarity, reduce tinnitus, and protect long-term ear and brain health. But what exactly is it? And how did it come to stand out in a sea of overpromising products? Let\u2019s dive into the origin of Whispeara, what makes it unique, and why it\u2019s becoming the top choice for people seeking a natural path to sharper hearing. A Solution Born From Frustration According to Whispeara\u2019s official page, the formula was developed in response to a growing problem: millions of individuals suffering from progressive hearing loss, ringing in the ears, and deep frustration with conventional solutions like hearing aids, medications, or surgeries. The creators behind Whispeara recognized that many of the available options on the market failed to address the root causes of auditory decline. Hearing aids merely amplify sound\u2014they don\u2019t repair or protect. Prescription medications often treat symptoms with a laundry list of side effects. And surgical options, while occasionally effective, are both expensive and invasive. Whispeara, in contrast, was formulated to be simple, non-invasive, and accessible to everyone. It was built on the philosophy that restoring hearing requires supporting the full system\u2014ear, brain, and nerve health\u2014not just amplifying external sounds. This approach is designed to provide relief and comfort to those struggling with hearing issues. A Comprehensive, Multi-Stage Approach Whispeara\u2019s standout feature lies in its multi-layered formula. Rather than focusing on just one element of ear health, the supplement takes a holistic view, providing a comprehensive solution that addresses various aspects of hearing health. This is designed to reassure the audience of the thoroughness of the product. Detoxification : Helps cleanse the auditory system from toxins and oxidative stressors that disrupt inner ear and brain communication. Repair and Nourishment : Delivers essential nutrients to rebuild and support the delicate structures of the ear and auditory nerves. Neural Activation : Enhances brain-ear communication by supporting cognitive clarity and neurotransmitter function involved in processing sound. Inflammation Defense : Includes anti-inflammatory agents to reduce swelling and increase circulation in the auditory system. This full-spectrum support is what separates Whispeara from many single-function hearing formulas that may only target tinnitus or ear circulation. Why Whispeara is Gaining Momentum As more people search for effective, affordable, and natural ways to manage their hearing challenges, Whispeara has quickly become one of the most trusted options available. Its rise in popularity isn\u2019t just due to smart marketing\u2014it\u2019s because the product offers a comprehensive alternative to the limitations of traditional hearing interventions. In fact, the product is often referred to as the best natural hearing support formula available in 2025, thanks to its carefully researched blend of ingredients, its non-habit-forming design, and its commitment to long-term hearing wellness. From individuals in their 40s starting to experience early signs of hearing decline, to seniors who are tired of relying on clunky, uncomfortable hearing devices, Whispeara is proving to be a welcome, empowering solution. And as we\u2019ll see in the next section, the formula behind it is more than just impressive\u2014it\u2019s rooted in science. Order Whispeara Today and Start Hearing the World Clearly Again Inside the Formula \u2013 Ingredient Deep Dive At the heart of Whispeara\u2019s success is its carefully chosen blend of natural ingredients, each selected for its unique contribution to auditory health, neurological function, and cellular protection. This isn\u2019t a random cocktail of herbs\u2014it\u2019s a purpose-built formula designed to address hearing loss and tinnitus at the source. This emphasis on purposeful design is intended to instill confidence in the effectiveness of our product. Let\u2019s explore the core ingredients inside Whispeara and the science behind how each one contributes to better hearing, reduced ringing, and long-term ear-brain harmony. The Science of Hearing Support Compounds Unlike standard hearing supplements that rely on just a few generic ingredients, Whispeara combines over a dozen nutrients, antioxidants, and plant extracts. These ingredients work synergistically to protect the auditory nerves, improve blood flow to the inner ear, and reduce inflammation that interferes with sound processing. Key components include: Moomiyo: The Unique Adaptogen for Cellular Vitality Research by Shakirov (2021), Ivanov (2020), and Kolesnikov (2019) has shown that Moomiyo (also known as Shilajit) plays a powerful role as a natural adaptogen with multi-system support capabilities. It enhances immune function, modulates inflammatory responses, and increases physical resilience\u2014all of which are crucial for the maintenance of cochlear health and inner ear function. Within Whispeara, Moomiyo stands out as a foundational antioxidant, uniquely contributing to the detoxification of the auditory system, support for ear canal detox, and reduction of cumulative stress that leads to age-related hearing decline. As a keystone botanical, Moomiyo's deep cellular restoration potential elevates Whispeara above the status quo of ear health supplements. Alpha-GPC: The Cognitive Enhancer for Brain-Ear Synchronization Studies by Kato et al. (2021), Canal et al. (1991), Gatti et al. (2011), and Parker et al. (2015) underscore the impact of Alpha-Glycerylphosphorylcholine (Alpha-GPC) on neurotransmitter support, cognitive clarity, and neuroplasticity. In Whispeara, Alpha-GPC plays a crucial role in the restoration of hearing clarity by optimizing acetylcholine transmission, a key neurotransmitter in the auditory cortex. This nutrient supports both the processing speed of auditory signals and mood regulation, helping to address the mental fog and frustration often linked with tinnitus and hearing loss. Sangiorgi et al. (1994) even noted its promise in managing cognitive decline, placing Whispeara in a class of neuro-hearing protection formulas rather than just a basic supplement. GABA: The Neural Soother for Tinnitus and Auditory Overload Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), supported by Smith et al. (2018) and Lee et al. (2017), is the brain\u2019s primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, essential for calming hyperactive nerve signals. In cases of tinnitus and auditory fatigue, dysregulated excitatory activity is common. Whispeara's use of GABA is instrumental in soothing overactive auditory pathways, promoting tranquility in the brain\u2019s hearing centers. This mechanism is a key component of Whispeara\u2019s tinnitus formula, helping to reduce ringing, buzzing, and static noise\u2014a benefit often echoed in real reviews of Whispeara. Mucuna Pruriens (L-Dopa): Neuromotor and Auditory Enhancement Gupta et al. (2019) and Zhang et al. (2020) highlight L-Dopa extracted from Mucuna Pruriens as a dopaminergic precursor vital for neuroregeneration and motor response. In hearing, dopamine helps modulate synaptic strength in auditory nerve fibers, particularly those that relay sound intensity and pitch. By including L-Dopa, Whispeara reinforces the brain-ear connection, improves response to environmental sound stimuli, and supports neurotransmitter balance. This compound is especially important in addressing age-related hearing decline and supplements that improve auditory signals. L-Arginine: The Vascular Booster for Inner Ear Circulation According to Wu et al. (2016) and Bescos et al. (2012), L-Arginine is a nitric oxide precursor that enhances vascular dilation, thereby improving blood flow to inner ear structures. Good circulation is essential for delivering nutrients and oxygen to the cochlea and surrounding tissues. Whispeara\u2019s use of L-Arginine supports inner ear function, enhances auditory clarity, and contributes to ear health supplements that work by facilitating microvascular repair and nutrient transport\u2014elements that are crucial in hearing improvement through supplements. L-Tyrosine: Resilience Under Cognitive Load L-Tyrosine, as studied by Deijen et al. (2000) and Neri et al. (2015), is a precursor to dopamine and norepinephrine, making it vital for stress resilience and focus under pressure. For individuals with hearing challenges, especially in loud or chaotic environments, the brain\u2019s ability to focus and filter sound is often impaired. By incorporating L-Tyrosine, Whispeara enhances auditory concentration, combats cognitive fatigue, and supports neuro-auditory pathways\u2014making it a key player in the formula\u2019s ability to restore hearing naturally and promote hearing clarity support. Detox, Repair, and Restore Each capsule of Whispeara is designed to perform three key functions, ensuring comprehensive auditory health: Detoxify the auditory system \u2013 clearing buildup and neutralizing toxins that interfere with hearing. Rebuild and nourish \u2013 supporting healthy ear tissue, hair cells, and nerves. Improve neural connections \u2013 enhancing the way your brain interprets sound signals sent from the ear. This is especially important for individuals experiencing high-pitched ringing, buzzing, or static-like noise in the ears. Tinnitus often stems from miscommunication between damaged nerves and the auditory cortex. Whispeara's formula helps soothe this interference by calming inflammation and re-establishing clear nerve pathways. All-Natural, Non-Habit-Forming, and Easy to Use Whispeara stands out from other supplements in its category. It\u2019s not a synthetic compound or a pharmaceutical-grade chemical. Instead, it's a gentle, non-habit-forming, and all-natural solution for auditory health. Every ingredient is included in clinically supported dosages and manufactured in a facility that follows strict quality control practices. Whispeara is not just safe, but also inclusive. It\u2019s vegetarian-friendly, gluten-free, and free from GMOs or artificial additives\u2014making it a safe choice for most individuals looking for an all-natural path to restored hearing. This emphasis on inclusivity is designed to make our potential customers feel catered to and considered in our product design. Say Goodbye to Ringing\u2014Buy Whispeara While Supplies Last How Whispeara Works in the Body Hearing is more than just what your ears pick up\u2014it\u2019s what your brain understands. Whispeara was uniquely formulated not just to enhance the ears, but to restore the entire hearing system, including the neurological connections that interpret sound. This innovative, multi-step internal approach is what sets Whispeara apart from temporary fixes like hearing aids or masking devices, and it's sure to pique your interest. Rather than amplifying noise, Whispeara helps the body work better\u2014clearing pathways, reducing inflammation, and optimizing the transmission of sound from the ears to the brain.Here\u2019s how the process unfolds. The 3-Stage Process of Hearing Restoration Whispeara follows a phased biological process that mirrors the body\u2019s own repair mechanisms. Its ingredients work in unison through the following stages, providing a natural and reassuring path to hearing restoration: Stage 1: Detoxification and Ear Cleansing Whispeara begins by targeting the toxic buildup that often blocks optimal auditory function. Environmental pollutants, heavy metals, synthetic chemicals, and even chronic stress can introduce toxins into the bloodstream. These can interfere with nerve signaling and cause inflammation in the inner ear. Whispeara\u2019s antioxidant-rich ingredients like green tea extract and hawthorn berry go to work clearing this cellular debris, reducing oxidative stress, and refreshing the delicate tissues responsible for sound detection. Stage 2: Repair and Nutritional Rebuilding Once the environment is cleared, the next phase focuses on strengthening the physical structures involved in hearing. This includes the cochlea, auditory nerves, and neuro-auditory pathways. Critical vitamins like B6, B12, and niacin nourish the nerve sheaths and restore signaling potential, while magnesium and zinc support tissue repair and cellular renewal. This rebuilding stage is vital not just for people dealing with gradual hearing loss, but also those suffering from tinnitus\u2014often caused by inflammation or breakdown in the auditory nerve network. Stage 3: Brain-Ear Signal Optimization The final step in Whispeara\u2019s process is to enhance communication between the ears and the brain. Many people with hearing issues report that they \u201chear\u201d but can\u2019t \u201cunderstand.\u201d That\u2019s because the ear captures sound, but the brain deciphers it. When that system is out of sync, confusion, echoing, or muffled hearing can occur. Whispeara supports cognitive clarity through ingredients like ginkgo biloba, which improves blood flow to brain regions responsible for auditory processing. As signal clarity improves, users often report that voices sound sharper, environmental noises are less distorted, and concentration improves\u2014especially in noisy environments like restaurants or group conversations. For instance, users may find it easier to follow conversations in a crowded room or enjoy music without distortion. Long-Term Auditory Health Support This 3-phase cycle isn\u2019t just a short-term fix\u2014it\u2019s designed to build long-term resilience in your auditory system. Regular use of Whispeara can help protect against future decline, support better cognitive function, and preserve the quality of life that comes from clear, confident hearing. This long-term support is sure to give you hope for a better hearing future. Unlike conventional options that focus on one aspect of hearing, such as amplifying sound or reducing tinnitus, Whispeara offers a full-system upgrade: cleansing, rebuilding, and optimizing your body\u2019s natural hearing process\u2014without the need for batteries, invasive procedures, or discomfort. This comprehensive approach sets Whispeara apart from temporary fixes like hearing aids or masking devices, which often provide short-term relief without addressing the underlying issues. Benefits You Can Expect \u2013 From Silence to Clarity Whispeara isn\u2019t just about protecting hearing\u2014it\u2019s about restoring a richer, fuller sensory experience that many people haven\u2019t felt in years. Whether you\u2019re dealing with mild tinnitus, significant hearing decline, or just want to stay ahead of age-related auditory deterioration, Whispeara delivers a broad spectrum of benefits that go far beyond simple sound amplification. Here\u2019s a detailed look at what users can expect\u2014physically, emotionally, and mentally\u2014when taking Whispeara regularly. Immediate and Long-Term Results While every body responds differently, many users report subtle improvements within the first few weeks. This often includes a reduction in the volume or frequency of ringing in the ears, better clarity in everyday conversations, and a noticeable sense of \u201ccalm\u201d in the auditory field. As the detox and repair phases of Whispeara\u2019s process take hold, more profound changes can occur: Improved word recognition \u2013 No more \u201cHuh?\u201d or \u201cCan you repeat that?\u201d moments during conversations. Less audio distortion \u2013 Sounds become crisper and easier to isolate, even in noisy environments like restaurants or crowded events. Enhanced sound localization \u2013 You\u2019ll be able to better determine where sounds are coming from, which improves situational awareness. More restful sleep \u2013 Especially for those dealing with constant ringing or buzzing that interrupts rest. Over time, with consistent use, Whispeara may help restore the body\u2019s natural auditory processing abilities, reduce nerve inflammation, and protect against further decline. The goal isn\u2019t just symptom relief\u2014it\u2019s whole-system balance. Tinnitus and Ringing Relief One of the most common reasons people turn to Whispeara is to manage tinnitus\u2014the persistent ringing, buzzing, hissing, or pulsing noise that originates in the ears or brain. Tinnitus isn\u2019t just irritating; it can be mentally exhausting, interfere with sleep, and make everyday life stressful. Whispeara understands this and is here to provide relief. Whispeara approaches tinnitus not as a standalone problem, but as a symptom of underlying inflammation and neurological misfiring. By targeting the root causes through its anti-inflammatory and nerve-calming ingredients like garlic extract, magnesium, and vitamin B complex, many users have reported a significant reduction in their tinnitus volume and frequency. While there is no known \u201ccure\u201d for chronic tinnitus, Whispeara offers a realistic and science-backed path to meaningful relief. Support for Age-Related Hearing Decline Hearing loss due to aging\u2014also known as presbycusis\u2014is a slow, progressive condition that impacts millions. It typically begins with difficulty hearing high-pitched sounds or understanding speech in noisy environments and gradually worsens over time. Whispeara addresses the most common contributors to age-related hearing loss: oxidative stress, blood flow reduction, and nerve signal degradation. With consistent use, the supplement supports better oxygen and nutrient delivery to the ears and brain, helping seniors stay sharp and socially engaged for longer. Instead of waiting for your hearing to deteriorate past the point of no return, Whispeara offers proactive protection and maintenance. It's about taking control of your auditory health and ensuring a better quality of life. Overall Auditory Clarity and Focus It\u2019s not just about hearing sounds\u2014it\u2019s about understanding them clearly. Whispeara improves auditory clarity by supporting both the mechanical and neurological sides of hearing. As blood flow improves and inflammation reduces, your brain processes sound more efficiently, reducing mental fatigue and increasing comprehension. This clarity translates to better focus, stronger memory, and reduced strain in social interactions\u2014something users often describe as \u201cgetting their life back.\u201d Real Stories, Real Relief \u2013 What Users Are Saying While science and formulation are crucial, nothing validates a product like real experiences from everyday people. Whispeara has been gaining a strong reputation through word-of-mouth and verified customer feedback\u2014not just for what it promises, but for what it delivers. People across age groups and backgrounds have shared their personal stories of frustration turned into relief, and silence replaced by clarity. Here\u2019s a closer look at what users are saying about Whispeara, and how this natural supplement has made a real difference in their daily lives. Verified Testimonials from Everyday Users Many individuals turn to Whispeara as a last resort\u2014after trying hearing aids, sound machines, or other supplements that just didn\u2019t help. What they discover instead is often described as surprising, even life-changing, sparking a sense of hope and intrigue in potential users. \u201cI was skeptical at first, but after about three weeks on Whispeara, the buzzing in my ears began to fade.

Hear Every Word Again\u2014Act Fast, Get Whispeara Today Safety, Side Effects & Suitability When choosing any supplement\u2014especially one targeting something as delicate as hearing\u2014safety is a top concern. Whispeara positions itself not only as effective, but also as gentle, natural, and free of the typical side effects seen with pharmaceuticals or invasive procedures. This natural and gentle approach should provide users with a sense of reassurance and peace of mind. So what should users know before getting started? Let\u2019s explore Whispeara\u2019s safety profile, any potential side effects, and who is best suited to take it. Designed for Daily Use Without Dependency Whispeara is formulated with a blend of plant-based extracts, essential vitamins, and minerals \u2014with no synthetic stimulants, artificial chemicals, or habit-forming substances . The product is non-GMO, gluten-free, dairy-free, and manufactured in a facility that adheres to strict GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) standards. This attention to purity makes it ideal for long-term use. Unlike hearing aids, which require constant upkeep, or prescription drugs that may lead to side effects or tolerance over time, Whispeara is designed to integrate seamlessly into your daily wellness regimen with minimal risk. Users report that the supplement is easy on the stomach , especially when taken with a meal, and most experience no adverse effects at all \u2014even after extended use. What About Side Effects? While Whispeara is generally very well-tolerated, it\u2019s important to consider that every individual responds differently to supplements. A small number of users may experience mild side effects during the first few days as their body adjusts. These may include: Light digestive discomfort Temporary increase in awareness of ear sensitivity (as circulation improves) Slight headache or fatigue during detox phase These effects are typically short-lived and can often be mitigated by staying hydrated and taking the supplement after meals. If symptoms persist, it\u2019s always wise to consult a healthcare provider. Who Should Use Whispeara? Whispeara is intended for adults experiencing hearing concerns , such as: Gradual or sudden hearing decline Ringing or buzzing in the ears (tinnitus) Difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments Age-related auditory fatigue Long-term ear health support It\u2019s especially ideal for those who: Want a non-invasive, natural solution Are not ready for or dissatisfied with hearing aids Are seeking a preventative measure for long-term auditory health Who Should Consult a Doctor First? While Whispeara is safe for most adults, there are certain groups who should seek medical guidance before beginning any new supplement: Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions (especially neurological or circulatory) Those currently taking prescription medications , particularly blood thinners or neuroregulators Pregnant or breastfeeding women Anyone under the age of 18 Whispeara is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. It should be viewed as a supportive wellness tool , not a substitute for professional medical treatment or hearing care services. Peace of Mind with a Satisfaction Guarantee One of the strongest endorsements of Whispeara\u2019s safety and trustworthiness is the company\u2019s 100% satisfaction guarantee . This guarantee provides users with the peace of mind that they can try the product risk-free for several months, with a full refund available if they\u2019re not satisfied with the results. This customer-first policy speaks to the brand\u2019s confidence in both the safety and performance of its formula, giving users a sense of security and confidence in their purchase. Comparing Whispeara to the Competition The natural supplement market is overflowing with products that claim to support hearing, brain function, or both. Butnot all supplements are created equal. Many are underdosed, poorly formulated, or focused on general wellness rather than the specific causes of hearing decline. Whispeara, however, sets itself apart through its clarity, focus, and performance\u2014and a comparison with other popular formulas makes that crystal clear. A Sharper Focus on Hearing One of the most noticeable differences between Whispeara and alternatives like Quietum Plus, Cortexi, and Synapse XT is its unique focus . While Whispeara was developed specifically for auditory restoration , many competing products take a broader, less defined approach. This distinct focus of Whispeara reassures you that it's designed to address your specific needs. Quietum Plus, for example, includes a variety of herbal ingredients, but its focus is spread across stress management, circulation, and hormonal support\u2014not strictly on ear health. Cortexi markets itself heavily as a cognitive and metabolic enhancer, not a hearing-specific formula. Synapse XT is designed primarily to promote mental clarity and brain function, with minimal direct action on auditory pathways or inner ear support. Whispeara\u2019s mission is different. Every ingredient is included to serve the ear-brain connection \u2014to detoxify the auditory system, reduce inflammation, improve signal clarity, and support nerve repair. This hearing-first philosophy makes it a more targeted and effective option for those struggling with hearing loss or tinnitus. Ingredient Transparency and Quality Another key differentiator is transparency . Whispeara clearly lists its ingredients and their dosages on the product page, so users know exactly what they\u2019re putting into their body. This kind of openness is rare. Many other supplements hide their formulations behind vague \"proprietary blends,\" which means you don\u2019t know how much of each ingredient you're getting\u2014or whether it\u2019s enough to be effective. In contrast, Whispeara\u2019s formulation is backed by clinical research and real-world user outcomes . Each component is selected for its proven benefits, and the dosages align with levels shown in studies to produce results. The inclusion of ingredients like hawthorn berry, garlic extract, B-vitamins, ginkgo biloba, magnesium, and niacin provides support across multiple systems\u2014auditory, neural, vascular, and cognitive\u2014without relying on synthetic fillers, stimulants, or artificial compounds. Customer Experiences Speak Louder Than Labels Beyond formulations, the most compelling evidence comes from the people who\u2019ve actually used the products. Many users report disappointment with competing supplements, saying they either didn\u2019t notice any real changes or felt the results were too subtle to justify the cost. Whispeara\u2019s customers, however, tend to express satisfaction with their noticeable results \u2014often within the first few weeks. Tinnitus relief, improved conversation clarity, and a greater sense of peace and mental sharpness are among the most commonly shared outcomes. This high level of user satisfaction should give you confidence in Whispeara's effectiveness. The fact that many Whispeara users go on to reorder and recommend the product is another major advantage\u2014it\u2019s not just being bought, it\u2019s being trusted. Value for Your Investment When comparing cost, most hearing supplements land in a similar price range. But Whispeara stands out for what you\u2019re actually receiving. Not only is the formula more targeted and potent, but it also comes with a generous money-back guarantee that gives users plenty of time to try it risk-free. This value for money makes Whispeara a wise investment in your health. For those looking to stock up, multi-bottle bundles bring the price down considerably, and the brand offers periodic discounts that make it one of the more accessible premium formulas available. Why Whispeara Wins To put it simply, Whispeara is designed specifically for people who want to support, restore, and protect their hearing \u2014not just boost brain power or overall wellness. Its focus, transparency, positive user outcomes, and strong refund policy make it the clear leader in the natural hearing support space. If you\u2019ve tried other supplements and walked away disappointed, Whispeara could be the one that actually delivers. How to Use Whispeara for Best Results One of the most comforting aspects of Whispeara is its simplicity in becoming a part of your daily routine. There are no complex programs, no messy drops, no external devices to manage\u2014just two capsules a day. But like any supplement, consistency and proper usage are key to experiencing its full range of benefits. Here\u2019s everything you need to know to get the most out of Whispeara. Simple, Effective Dosage The recommended dosage for Whispeara is two capsules per day , preferably taken with a meal and a glass of water. This ensures proper absorption of fat-soluble nutrients and reduces the chance of mild stomach discomfort, which can sometimes occur when taking any supplement on an empty stomach. Some users prefer taking both capsules in the morning for an early mental and auditory boost, while others split the dose\u2014one with breakfast and one with dinner\u2014for sustained support throughout the day. Either method is effective, so it\u2019s more about what fits your lifestyle best. When Will You Start to Notice Results? While some people report subtle changes within the first few days\u2014such as a decrease in tinnitus intensity or feeling more \u201cpresent\u201d in conversations\u2014 Whispeara is not a quick fix . It\u2019s a formula designed to repair, restore, and protect hearing over time. For most users, noticeable improvements begin around the 2- to 4-week mark , especially when it comes to clarity, ringing reduction, and ear sensitivity. The detoxification and repair stages typically take place in the first month. Continued use for 60 to 90 days tends to deliver deeper, more long-lasting changes in auditory health and overall cognitive performance. That\u2019s why the company recommends purchasing a multi-month supply, particularly for those with moderate to severe hearing concerns. Tips for Maximizing Your Results To get the most out of your Whispeara experience, here are a few best practices to follow: Take it consistently \u2013 Missing doses can delay your progress. Try setting a reminder if needed. Stay hydrated \u2013 Water helps the body flush out toxins and supports circulation to the ears and brain. Pair with healthy habits \u2013 Reduce exposure to loud environments, use ear protection when necessary, and avoid excessive use of earbuds or headphones. Get enough sleep \u2013 Proper rest supports neurological repair and recovery, which enhances the effects of hearing support supplements. Be patient \u2013 Natural restoration takes time. Whispeara is working behind the scenes to recalibrate your body, reduce inflammation, and optimize neural pathways. Can You Stack It With Other Supplements? Yes. Whispeara is generally safe to take alongside other wellness supplements such as multivitamins, omega-3s, or memory-support formulas. This safety aspect is designed to reassure you. However, if you\u2019re using medications\u2014especially those that affect blood flow, neurological health, or inflammation\u2014it\u2019s wise to consult your healthcare provider just to be sure there are no interactions. What\u2019s important is that Whispeara doesn\u2019t rely on stimulants or sedatives, making it safe for both daytime and evening use, without the risk of jitters, crashes, or dependency. In summary, Whispeara was designed to be as convenient as it is effective. Just two capsules a day may be all it takes to start hearing better, thinking more clearly, and finally feeling like yourself again. This convenience is meant to put you at ease and make the process more comfortable.

Now, with Epomaker's Magforce 68, the company has been able to integrate compactness, design, and quality all in a single package, and this particular keyboard is what I would call one of the best options out there if you are looking for something \"small.\" Epomaker Magforce 68 - Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro Switches, Hall Effect Technology & Speedy Type-C Connection Well, in the keyboards segment, there are really many 65% layout options that are said to be something a hardcore gamer would prefer, and Epomaker probably had these in mine before designing the Magforce 68. For someone like me whose work performance revolves around having a decent keyboard, my experience with this keyboard has been a charm. While the \"compactness\" hasn't appealed to me much, the typing quality is simply something that I am sure every purchaser will appreciate. Related Story Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives Thinks Trump Has Taken \u201cThe Doomsday Scenario Off The Table\u201d And Tech Stocks Will Rally Come Monday, But One Options Market Veteran Feels \u201cIt\u2019s A Crowded Trade\u201d For a quick rundown of Epomaker Magforce 68 specifications, it features the Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro switches, which we'll discuss extensively ahead of time, along with a CNC aluminum body and much more. Here's a summary of the keyboard's features/specifications: Specification Details Brand EPOMAKER Model Magforce 68 Layout 65% ANSI US Layout Number of Keys 68 keys Connectivity Type-C Wired Compatibility WIN Case Material Aluminum Finish Anodized Flex-Cut No Flex-Cut Mounting Structure Top-Mount Plate Material FR4 PCB Thickness 1.6mm Stabilizers Plate-Mount Stabilizer Typing Angle 7 degree Sound Dampening Poron Sandwich Foam, Bottom Foam, Bottom EVA Keycaps Profile Cherry Profile Keycaps Material PBT Plastic Keycaps Manufacturing Technique Double-Shot RGB South-facing, per-key RGB Polling Rate 8000Hz Scan Rate 32kHz per key Latency 0.125ms (USB) Anti-Ghosting N-Key Rollover Keyboard Dimensions 314.5 * 113.9 * 38.6 mm Keyboard Weight 1.5kg Package Weight About 2kg Epomaker Magforce 68 - Unboxing & Close-Up The packaging of the keyboard is undoubtedly creative, as the box features a black and blue-themed design, with the branding at the very front. When you open up the box, there's cushioning on both the top and the bottom, which means that the company has ensured that the unit doesn't get damaged when shipping it across different regions. Inside the box, you get the standard manual, a Type-C USB cable, and a keycap puller, which is pretty standard for every keyboard. You also get extra Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro switches in case a replacement is needed, which might come in handy. When I saw the keyboard for the first time, I started to think about the unit's compactness, since I could almost carry its weight entirely at the palm of my hands. That is indeed the beauty of a 65% layout, since not only does it make portability much easier, but it occupies a little space on your desk, which means that you can use the extra space left for something else. But, you do get void of elements such as a dedicated numpad, so it is more of a consumer choice in the end. Starting with the keycaps come in a cherry profile design, which is the common notion in the segment. They are made out of PBT Plastic, which not only is a sturdy material but also ensures that there are no thumbprint impressions on the keycaps after extensive use, and I did notice this after using the keyboard for several days. Another interesting factor about the Magforce 68 is its sound-dampening mechanism, which uses Poron Sandwich Foam as the main cushion, creating that \"crisp\" typing sound. Epomaker Magforce 68 - Design Language, Hall Effect Technology & Gateron Magnetic Switches One thing about the keyboard that makes it a bit weird is the design language. The overall vibe of the product is seen as something \"minimalistic\" and more professional-oriented, but switching on the RGB makes the design layout complicated. Apart from this, the RGB really strikes out when you look at it for the very first time, and a more \"diffused\" look would have been a better choice, like the Galaxy100 counterpart. One of the standout features of the Magforce 68 is the \"Hall Effect\" technology, which uses a magnetic field to detect keystrokes, providing a smoother and quieter experience. Here's how Epomaker describes it: This feature allows users to fine-tune the actuation distance, catering to specific gaming or typing preferences. The Snap Tap function ensures rapid keystroke registration, while the Dead Zone adjustment eliminates unintended inputs, providing unparalleled control. This level of customization, powered by magnetic switches, ensures that every keystroke is accurate and consistent, enhancing performance across various use cases. So, consumers of different segments could easily fine-tune the actuation distance to get the desired typing experience, which really opens up the Magforce 68 to several types of users. You can utilize Epomaker's cloud adjustment platform to fine-tune the keyboard's performance. Speaking of the onboard switches, the Epomaker Magforce 68 comes with the widely-known Gateron Magnetic Jade Pro, a magnetic linear switch popular for their \"cracky\" sound, similar to Mahjong tiles clicking together. They come with a travel distance of 3.5mm with a lifespan of over 100 million keystrokes. These switches are primarily used in keyboards supporting the Hall Effect technology and are widely used by a variety of keyboard integrators. Since switches are a personal preference, I won't comment much on them, apart from the fact that if you don't like a \"cracky-sounded\" keyboard, the Magforce 68 isn't for you. Epomaker Magforce 68 Conclusion - Ideal Option If Compact & High-Performing Keyboard Is Your Need This particular keyboard is one of the best options in a 65% layout segment, but it comes with a hefty price tag of $159.99, which might seem justified if you look at the specifications alone. If you are eager to purchase the Epomaker Magforce 68, you can refer to the company's official website here and enjoy a great experience. 8.5 WCCFTECH RATING The Epomaker Magforce 68 is a great option for consumers looking for a compact keyboard option that features a great typing experience. Combined with the Hall Effect technology, the Magforce 68 is suited for many consumers out there.

It has (mostly) been all I have needed. Now that 10 support is ending, I was thinking of what I may use next, but really don't want have to go through the Windows installation which I found a nightmare! I am looking at this can anyone offer advice/opinions? The Amazon description seems rather lacking especially in the O.S. area and I wouldn't want to end up with having to buy and install my own copy of Windows! \ud83d\ude44 Thanks.

Back to top #4 six-h six-h Topic Starter Members 450 posts OFFLINE Gender: Male Location: North West England Local time: 07:16 PM Posted Yesterday, 01:31 PM @Cat Herder I agree, they are brilliant. I have been an Intel fan for many years but have a sneaky feeling that AMD currently give better bang for the bucks. Since my desire is to gain entry to the W11 party without the graft of installation, the lack of detail on the proffered OS is a deal breaker. Just wondering if there are any Beelink aficionado's here who can clarify just what we would likely receive, seems from the responses on the \"hotukdeals site\" even the dratted model is also now in dispute!! Back to top #5 six-h six-h Topic Starter Members 450 posts OFFLINE Gender: Male Location: North West England Local time: 07:16 PM Posted Yesterday, 01:34 PM Thanks @PhillPower2, so that's a \"No\"! Back to top #6 ranchhand_ ranchhand_ Members 5,719 posts OFFLINE Gender: Male Location: Midwest Local time: 12:16 PM Posted Yesterday, 02:09 PM You asked for an evaluation, but have not detailed exactly you want to use this for, so this cripples any responses. The specs are good, and the Ryzen9 CPU is a top-contender. I have built 2 desktops using the Ryzen7 and 32 gigs RAM and they jet through programs on Windows 11. I am about ready to start a new build using the Ryzen7, that's how much I like AMD. If you are going to use it only for streaming videos, watching movies and surfing the internet to shopping sites, etc. the specs are fine. Note what it is intended for with the amount of RAM that is devoted to graphical interface, about half of the 32gigs. So...if you run heavy duty programs such as video editing & creation, this is going to slow down a lot. I am a bit careful because Amazon lists only 15 ratings, and out of those only 5 users actually posted in with reviews. They claim as follows: \" 89% positive ratings from 200+ customers \" but I don't see those Amazon ratings. They claim this is a gaming machine. I seriously doubt that, unless childrens', low-overhead games that I am sure you would not be interested in are played. They claim this will run Photoshop. Well, ok, maybe only if it comes with Windows11 (not spec'd) and it will run very slow-w-w-w-w. What I don't like is that it appears not to come with an OS, or with one unspecified. Possibly using Linux? That's a deal-breaker for me. Here in the USA Amazon gives a 30-day return period for almost any reason, postage paid. If you have that in the UK then you are pretty safe. Really work the bejabbers out of it immediately to have it prove itself. Honestly, I would pass on it. Edited by ranchhand_, Yesterday, 02:12 PM.

You have more or less summed up my intended usage, but I do do quite a lot of Photo manipulation with Elements 2019 and some Video work using Shotcut which my current Intel i5 based NUC manages reasonably quickly though I suspect My demands are few since it achieves all I require with only 8GB of DDR4 ! The total confusion around this Amazon offer leads me to believe that it will not be the specification we think it will be. Returning may also be disappointing since we pay the import duty and tax up front and I suspect that may not be refundable. Think I'll wait for something a little less nebulous!

I take your point and also the advice of @PhillPower2 and will \"step away\" from that deal! I think I'll wait and see if there are any good deals during the year. Having always had Intel based machines before, I fancy AMD Ryzen are perhaps better value/faster these days. I've lived with this NUCi5SYH machine with 8GB DDR4 which has been capable of satisfying most of my needs despite having the OS Trashed by Microsoft's engineers who Naused up their attempt to create \"Libraries\" for me and I ended up with two folders with exactly the same content, ...everything that was on the dratted machine! So traumatised was I from doing the original install, I couldn't face doing it again to correct their mistake. That's why I really need my next machine to have W11 preinstalled. Hopefully something will come along before W10 expires that will fit my fairly conservative needs.

Golden rule when asking for help with a new rig ( or even upgrading ) is to state your intended use and when possible your maximum budget, if we know your intended use we can do some research for you. Being honest I am a bit taken aback about your almost fear of installing Windows, it is far easier nowadays and especially when you think back to the days when you had to slipstream SATA drivers into Windows XP.

Introduction In an age where physical performance, mental clarity, and intimate vitality are becoming critical to men's overall health, the market for male enhancement supplements continues to grow at an unprecedented pace. Whether it's due to age-related decline, chronic stress, or sedentary lifestyles, many men today face issues related to low stamina, diminished drive, and fluctuating testosterone levels. This surge in demand has led to an influx of quick-fix solutions and synthetic alternatives\u2014many of which underdeliver or include hidden subscriptions and questionable ingredients.

With a clean formulation, no hidden auto-shipments, and a 180-day money-back guarantee, Alpha Bites is rapidly earning its place as a trusted name in men's health.

It will also explore the specific pain points men face, how this supplement addresses them, and why it has become a standout performer among male enhancement supplements on the market today. Whether you're seeking improved energy, enhanced intimacy, or just a natural edge in your day-to-day performance, this article delivers everything you need to know\u2014accurately, thoroughly, and without the hype. If you're ready to take the next step towards improving your health and vitality, consider giving Alpha Bites a try. II. Understanding the Root of Male Performance Decline Declining male performance is a topic that is often met with silence, yet it impacts millions of men across age groups and lifestyles. The signs may begin subtly: lower energy levels, reduced interest in intimacy, difficulty maintaining stamina during physical or mental tasks, or even a loss of self-confidence. Over time, these issues can become persistent and disruptive, affecting not only personal health but also relationships, work performance, and emotional well-being. The Biological Causes of Performance Decline One of the most common causes of diminished male vitality is the natural decline in testosterone levels that begins as early as the late 20s or early 30s. Testosterone plays a central role in regulating muscle mass, bone density, libido, mood, and energy. As levels drop over time, men may experience a wide array of unwanted symptoms, including fatigue, mood swings, decreased libido, and even reduced cognitive sharpness. Additionally, poor blood flow\u2014a key factor in physical and sexual performance\u2014is often linked to sedentary habits, poor nutrition, and oxidative stress. As circulation worsens, the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to critical areas, including the brain and reproductive organs, is compromised. This leads to reduced performance and delayed recovery. Lifestyle and Psychological Factors Performance is not purely physical; it is tightly connected to mental resilience and emotional health. Chronic stress, sleep deprivation, and poor dietary choices create a vicious cycle that further depletes energy reserves and hormonal balance. Anxiety and low self-esteem also feed into the problem, often worsening physical symptoms through psychosomatic responses. Furthermore, many men are unaware that nutritional deficiencies\u2014especially in key compounds like nitric oxide precursors, adaptogenic herbs, and essential vitamins\u2014contribute to poor stamina and drive. The modern diet is often stripped of these performance-supporting nutrients, leaving many to rely on stimulants or ineffective over-the-counter options that do little more than mask symptoms. Why Most Solutions Fall Short The supplement industry is flooded with fast-acting pills and synthetic stimulants that promise instant results but often come with undesirable trade-offs\u2014crashes, side effects, and even hidden subscriptions that trap consumers into recurring charges. Many of these products are underdosed, loaded with filler ingredients, or built on unproven formulas lacking clinical research. What men need is not just a short-term fix but a strategic, natural solution that supports their body's systems holistically\u2014from hormones and circulation to stress resilience and cellular energy. This is where Alpha Bites steps in. In the next section, we'll examine why Alpha Bites Male Enhancement Gummies have rapidly become a trusted product in the male health space, offering a complete and clinically grounded formula that targets the root causes of decline rather than merely covering up symptoms.

This section provides an in-depth examination of the core ingredients used in Alpha Bites, based on the official formulation listed on getalphabites.com , and explains how they work together to deliver measurable benefits. Each ingredient has been chosen based on its relevance to nitric oxide production, testosterone support, cognitive resilience, and overall male wellness. Let's take a closer look: 1. Catuaba Bark Extract (200 mg) Known in traditional Brazilian medicine for centuries, Catuaba bark is a natural aphrodisiac celebrated for its libido-enhancing effects.

Beet Root Powder (200 mg) Beets are a rich source of dietary nitrates, which convert into nitric oxide in the body\u2014a compound that supports vascular dilation and improved blood flow.

Benefit to users : Increases energy, libido, and stress resilience. Scientific connection : Clinical trials show improvements in mood, desire, and physical performance 4. Horny Goat Weed Extract (250 mg) Also known as Epimedium, this botanical contains icariin, a natural compound known for its phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitory activity.

Visit the official website: getalphabites.com Synergistic Effects and Formula Cohesion Unlike many products that stack ingredients haphazardly, Alpha Bites relies on intentional synergy.

Vitamin C ties the formula together by promoting cellular health and metabolic balance. There are no proprietary blends, which means users know precisely what they are consuming. This level of transparency is rare in the supplement space and underscores Alpha Bites' commitment to consumer trust. In the next section, we'll examine how these ingredients interact within the body and explore the science behind their combined effects on performance, vitality, and long-term health. V. How Alpha Bites Works: The Science Behind the Formula Understanding how Alpha Bites Male Enhancement Gummies deliver results requires examining the interplay of hormonal regulation, circulatory function, and cellular resilience. Each ingredient in the formula plays a distinct role, but the power of Alpha Bites lies in how these components work together to support the male body holistically. 1. Enhancing Circulation Through Nitric Oxide Pathways At the core of male physical and sexual performance is healthy blood flow. Without adequate circulation, achieving and sustaining performance\u2014whether in the gym or the bedroom\u2014becomes increasingly complex. Alpha Bites leverages Beet Root Powder and Horny Goat Weed, both of which contribute to nitric oxide production and vascular dilation. Beet Root Powder provides a natural source of nitrates, which the body converts into nitric oxide. This allows blood vessels to relax and expand, enhancing oxygen delivery to muscle tissue and intimate areas. Horny Goat Weed supports nitric oxide bioavailability while also acting as a PDE5 inhibitor, which can help maintain stronger, longer-lasting erections without pharmaceutical interference. By improving vascular tone and blood delivery, Alpha Bites helps optimize both physical endurance and intimate performance. 2. Supporting Natural Testosterone Levels Testosterone is a key hormone for male vitality, and Alpha Bites incorporates a three-pronged approach to supporting it naturally: Tribulus Terrestris supports testosterone synthesis and helps enhance the body's natural androgen response. Maca Extract is an adaptogen that indirectly supports hormonal balance by improving stress responses and overall endocrine function. Horny Goat Weed contains icariin, which has been shown in some studies to support testosterone signaling. While Alpha Bites does not contain synthetic testosterone or DHEA, it supports the body's own production and regulatory pathways, promoting balance rather than artificial spikes. 3. Addressing Stress and Mental Fatigue Performance is not just physical\u2014it is deeply tied to mental stamina, mood, and emotional resilience. Chronic stress elevates cortisol levels, which can interfere with testosterone and lead to symptoms like fatigue, reduced libido, and poor concentration. Maca Extract acts as a natural adaptogen to regulate stress and improve energy levels. Vitamin C helps lower oxidative stress and cortisol levels, contributing to a more stable mood and faster physical recovery. By targeting these underlying factors, Alpha Bites provides more than a temporary lift\u2014it helps rebuild a more balanced and energetic foundation for daily life. 4. Enhancing Libido and Sexual Desire Ingredients like Catuaba Bark and Maca have long-standing reputations in herbal medicine for their effects on sexual desire and arousal. These botanicals stimulate neurotransmitter activity and may help increase the frequency of spontaneous arousal and overall intimacy satisfaction. This effect is often enhanced by the circulatory benefits of Beet Root and Horny Goat Weed, which improve physical readiness during moments of intimacy. 5. Fast Absorption, Consistent Support Because Alpha Bites is delivered in gummy form, the active ingredients are absorbed more efficiently through the digestive tract compared to hard-pressed pills or tablets. This means faster action and better consistency in results over time. Used daily, Alpha Bites becomes a cumulative performance enhancer, supporting long-term energy, hormone health, stamina, and confidence\u2014without resorting to synthetic additives or crash-inducing stimulants. In the next section, we'll break down the specific, real-world benefits men are reporting from Alpha Bites, from energy and mood to libido and relationship satisfaction\u2014offering further insights into why this product stands out in the male enhancement supplement market. Don\u2019t Settle for Less\u2014Upgrade Your Stamina, Drive, and Confidence with Alpha Bites VI. The Benefits of Alpha Bites: What Users Can Expect While Alpha Bites is built on a foundation of natural ingredients and scientific theory, its actual value lies in the real, measurable benefits users experience when taken consistently. By addressing key biological, hormonal, and psychological factors affecting male vitality, Alpha Bites positions itself not only as a performance enhancer but also as a comprehensive male wellness support tool. Here's what men can realistically expect from incorporating Alpha Bites Male Enhancement Gummies into their daily routine: 1. Increased Energy and Stamina The combination of Maca Root, Vitamin C, and Beet Root Powder supports mitochondrial energy production and improved blood circulation, which directly translates into increased physical stamina and reduced fatigue. Men report more energy throughout the day without relying on caffeine or stimulants. Physical endurance, particularly in exercise or athletic contexts, improves due to better oxygen delivery and muscular recovery. 2. Enhanced Libido and Sexual Drive Loss of desire can be one of the most demoralizing experiences for men, especially when it happens gradually. Alpha Bites helps restore sexual interest, responsiveness, and spontaneous desire by boosting both mental and physical readiness. Catuaba Bark and Maca Extract stimulate neurotransmitter activity linked to arousal. Improved blood flow heightens sensitivity and physical responsiveness. 3. Improved Erection Quality and Performance Thanks to the nitric oxide-boosting effects of Horny Goat Weed and Beet Root, many users notice improvements in erection firmness, duration, and frequency\u2014without the use of synthetic chemicals. Better circulation ensures that tissues receive adequate blood flow for optimal function. Men report increased confidence and reduced performance anxiety. 4. Hormonal Support and Testosterone Balance With ingredients like Tribulus Terrestris and Horny Goat Weed, Alpha Bites supports testosterone activity, helping men regain their natural hormonal edge. Benefits include improved muscle tone, greater physical resilience, and enhanced mood. Unlike hormone replacement therapy, Alpha Bites works with the body's systems. 5. Stress Relief and Mood Stability Men often overlook the role that stress and mental fatigue play in diminishing performance. Alpha Bites supports emotional wellness through ingredients that stabilize cortisol and support the nervous system. Maca's adaptogenic properties help improve focus and mood under pressure. Vitamin C reduces oxidative stress and inflammation that may contribute to fatigue and mood swings. 6. Confidence, Motivation, and Quality of Life Perhaps the most overlooked but vital benefit of Alpha Bites is the restoration of confidence . As energy returns, drive improves, and relationships strengthen, men report feeling like themselves again\u2014often even better. Improved vitality contributes to greater motivation and productivity. Enhanced performance leads to more satisfying personal and professional relationships. The cumulative effect of Alpha Bites is a total upgrade in the male experience\u2014from the gym to the bedroom and from the boardroom to day-to-day interactions. These aren't short-term bursts of energy but long-lasting improvements rooted in better biological balance and nourishment.

These mental health benefits are subtle but powerful contributors to overall performance. \"I feel more in control of my stress, and my focus has improved. This wasn't just about performance\u2014it's made a difference in my daily mindset.\" \u2013 Mike T., Verified Customer, Age 50 No Side Effects, No Gimmicks Unlike many male enhancement products that are plagued by negative feedback due to hidden subscriptions, synthetic stimulants, or unwanted side effects, Alpha Bites is consistently praised for its clean formulation and transparent business model. \"No weird side effects. No surprises on my credit card. Just a solid supplement that works when you use it daily.\" \u2013 Brian C., Verified Customer, Age 45 Testimonials as Social Proof The volume and consistency of positive reviews for Alpha Bites act as compelling social proof, reinforcing its positioning as one of the top-rated male enhancement gummies in 2025. The results are not exaggerated promises of overnight success but relatively steady, compounding improvements in performance, confidence, and well-being. In the next section, we'll examine how to use Alpha Bites effectively to achieve optimal results and provide tips for incorporating it into a holistic male health routine. VIII. How to Use Alpha Bites for Maximum Results While the formulation behind Alpha Bites Male Enhancement Gummies is supported by science and user reviews, achieving optimal benefits depends on one crucial factor: consistency. Like any natural supplement, Alpha Bites is not intended to produce instant, pharmaceutical-like effects. Instead, it supports the body's internal systems over time, creating sustainable improvements in energy, hormonal balance, and performance. This section explains how to use Alpha Bites properly, what to expect at each stage of supplementation, and how to integrate the gummies into a broader lifestyle strategy for male health. Recommended Daily Dosage According to the manufacturer, the ideal usage protocol is: Take two Alpha Bites gummies once per day , preferably with food and water. Choose a consistent time of day (morning or early afternoon) to establish a routine. Do not exceed the suggested dosage, as the formulation has been calibrated for optimal efficacy at the recommended level. Short-Term vs Long-Term Results Alpha Bites is designed to support male health in both immediate and gradual ways: Within the first 1\u20132 weeks , many users report increased energy, mental clarity, and a noticeable uplift in stamina. By weeks 3\u20136 , improvements in mood, confidence, and libido tend to become more apparent. After 2\u20133 months , the effects may become more stable and profound\u2014particularly in hormonal balance, circulatory health, and overall vitality. For men over 40 or those with chronic fatigue or low testosterone symptoms, extended use (3\u20136 months) is encouraged to allow the adaptogenic and circulatory benefits to take full effect. Lifestyle Factors That Enhance Results To get the most from Alpha Bites, users are advised to complement supplementation with basic lifestyle principles: Stay hydrated : Water enhances nutrient absorption and supports circulation. Get adequate sleep : Hormonal restoration primarily occurs during deep sleep cycles. Exercise regularly : Even moderate physical activity supports blood flow, nitric oxide production, and testosterone regulation. Manage stress : Pairing Alpha Bites with mindfulness techniques or stress-reducing practices may enhance the product's adaptogenic effects. These habits don't accelerate results, help sustain long-term improvements, and maximize the supplement's return on investment. Warnings and Precautions While Alpha Bites is made from natural, non-GMO ingredients and is manufactured in FDA-registered facilities under GMP guidelines, users should be aware of the following: Do not use if under 18 years old . Consult a healthcare professional before starting if you have known medical conditions, are taking prescription medications, or are being treated for hormonal imbalances or cardiovascular issues. Avoid combining Alpha Bites with other testosterone boosters or nitric oxide supplements without medical guidance. In the next section, we'll evaluate Alpha Bites's performance compared to other leading male enhancement gummies on the market, analyzing differences in ingredients, results, and trustworthiness to demonstrate why Alpha Bites stands out in 2025. IX. Alpha Bites vs Other Male Enhancement Gummies The market for male enhancement products is highly competitive, and with dozens of brands promising everything from enhanced libido to instant performance, it's crucial to distinguish hype from substance. In this section, we compare Alpha Bites with other popular male enhancement gummies and supplements available in 2025, such as Boostaro, Red Boost, Erecta Gummies, and various private-label formulas found on eCommerce marketplaces. By examining ingredients, transparency, safety, pricing, and customer satisfaction , Alpha Bites emerges as a category leader designed with consumer trust and holistic male wellness in mind. 1. Ingredient Transparency and Dosage Integrity Many male enhancement products use proprietary blends\u2014meaning the ingredients are listed, but their exact dosages are hidden. This often results in underdosing, where key compounds like Maca or Tribulus are included in ineffective quantities for marketing purposes only. Alpha Bites: Fully discloses each active ingredient and its dosage . Avoids proprietary blends entirely. Includes clinically supported dosages of Beet Root, Maca, Horny Goat Weed, Tribulus Terrestris, Catuaba Bark, and Vitamin C. Competitors: Often rely on \"proprietary performance blends.\" Include filler ingredients or low concentrations of premium botanicals. May exaggerate benefits without scientific grounding. 2. Natural Formulation vs Synthetic Enhancers Alpha Bites: 100% plant-based , non-GMO, and free from synthetic hormones or chemicals. Designed to work with the body's hormonal and circulatory systems , not override them. Competitors: Some contain synthetic stimulants or harsh aphrodisiacs , increasing the risk of side effects. May rely on temporary vasodilators that lead to \"crashes\" or cardiovascular strain. 3. Performance vs Gimmicks Alpha Bites: Focuses on sustainable performance , not just a one-time boost. Designed for daily use to improve energy, stamina, and hormone balance over time. Competitors: Often marketed as \"fast-acting\" or \"instant results,\" it appeals to impulse buyers but lacks longevity. Formulas may not support long-term vitality, energy, or testosterone levels. 4. Purchasing Model and Guarantee Alpha Bites: Sold direct-to-consumer only from the official website ( getalphabites.com ). No hidden subscriptions or auto-shipments . Backed by a 180-day money-back guarantee \u2014far exceeding industry norms. Competitors: Many products offer 14- or 30-day return windows , with restocking fees. Auto-renew traps are typical\u2014some customers unknowingly subscribe to monthly billing. 5. User Trust and Reputation Alpha Bites: Highly rated for honest advertising , transparent formulation, and real results. Developed in the United States in GMP-certified, FDA-registered facilities . Earns trust through hundreds of verified positive testimonials. Competitors: Many brands have limited background transparency. Negative reviews often highlight billing disputes, side effects, or lack of results . Conclusion of Comparison When measured across core performance metrics, safety, pricing fairness, and long-term user experience, Alpha Bites consistently outperforms much of the competition. Its formula is not only clinically thoughtful but also ethically marketed, making it an ideal solution for men looking for real, sustainable results without compromises.

Gold Bond's firming neck and chest cream formulated with salicylic acid to exfoliate your skin (without being too rough), and hyaluronic acid to help it retain moisture. This can help your d\u00e9colletage area to appear smoother and firmer \u2014 in fact, multiple reviewers have noticed a difference in a matter of *pause for dramatic effect* DAYS. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"My dry neck and the annoying itchiness I used to experience have completely gone away after using this cream. It\u2019s not only soothing, but it also feels like it\u2019s really nourishing my skin. The firming benefits are a bonus! I highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with dryness or discomfort in their neck and chest area. It\u2019s become a must-have in my skincare routine.\" \u2014 JAcosta Get it from Amazon for $11.89 (also available in a two-pack). 2. A Bissell multipurpose carpet and upholstery cleaner reviewers absolutely love for removing stains and messes from carpets, furniture, and car interiors. Don't let the fact that it's small and portable fool you; this little green cleaning machine has a pow-er-ful suction! So if you've been ignoring those salt and mud stains all over the floor of your car, it's about time you clicked \"add to cart.\" www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I was super skeptical. My dog was not feeling well and started relieving himself on our bedroom rug. I had tried multiple spray cleaners and techniques but couldn\u2019t get the smell out. I was convinced I\u2019d need to get rid of my rug, and this was my last shot. I honestly thought I\u2019d have to return it. Nope!! Easy to assemble. Easy to use and clean. I used it with the pet cleaning solution. My rug is clean and odor free!!! I\u2019m excited to use this on my couch and in my car now. So happy!\" \u2014 Brittany Get it from Amazon for $122+ (available in three styles). 3. A pet ear cleanser for a gentle, non-toxic way to manage your doggo's dirty ears, especially if they have enough wax in there to make a (very gross) candle! Plus, it'll leave their ears smelling fresh because as much as we love our furry babes, they stink... like, all over... all the time. amazon.com Promising review: \"My husband and I just adopted our cute puppy, Winston, from the Humane Society. When we adopted him, his ears were unfortunately pretty dirty, but after we used this ear cleaner today, his ears are so clean!! I'm so amazed at everything it managed to get out. Our puppy's ears look so much better now! I would highly recommend this product to anyone with a dog.\" \u2014 Jerome F Get it from Amazon for $16.99 . 4. Topicals Faded serum to help reduce the appearance of dark spots, scars, and uneven skin tone. Thanks to its formula with antioxidants and inflammation-reducing and brightening ingredients (like kojic acid and niacinamide), many reviewers say the results are definitely noticeable with consistent use! One reviewer even calls it a \"miracle worker.\" Sephora Just so you know, reviewers say that Faded's scent is on the stronger side, but it's totally worth it once the results start happening! Topicals is a WOC-founded small business started by Claudia Teng and Olamide Olowe. The brand is all about helping you love the skin you're in, with a little help from their effective, science-backed products. Promising reviews : \" What is this witchcraft?! I've tried every hyped-up treatment on the market over the past five years to address hyperpigmentation, and none of them had the noticeable impact that Topicals Faded did in just three uses so far. This stuff is amazing. I have no idea why this has been so effective, but I'm a customer for life now.\" \u2014 ShannonD726 \" The hype is real!! This is an instant holy grail for me. Yes, there is a smell when you apply the product, but it dissipates almost instantly. In my opinion, it is worth it for the results. I would rather have a product that actually does what it says as opened to one that is filled with irritating fragrances. This product has revered hyperpigmentation that I have had for YEARS. Please never change!!\" \u2014 KierynJoy Get it from Amazon for $18+ (available in two sizes) or from Sephora for $18+ (available in two sizes). 5.

Promising reviews: \"Product was awesome. It rejuvenated a 5-year-old tattoo and made it look like new again. Mad Rabbit absorbed into the skin very easily without being greasy.\" \u2014 Janson Ward \"This stuff is the best! My girlfriend bought this before but I didn\u2019t like the scent she had, but the spreadability of this was to die for. When I found out they had different scents, I was so excited. I want to get more tattoos just so I can put it all over my body. \ud83e\udd23\" \u2014 Iris Kotico Get it from Amazon for $16.30+ (available in two scents). 6. A bottle of sulfate-free biotin shampoo infused with tea tree and argan oils to help stimulate hair growth. Over time, it's meant to make your locks appear fuller while also nourishing your scalp. More than 36,000 reviewers (with all different hair types) have noticed positive results \u2014 so if you've been searching and searching for a solution to hair thinning, give this a try! www.amazon.com Read more about how biotin shampoo could help with the fullness of hair at Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: \"I love this shampoo! I had gastric sleeve surgery and my hair was very, very thin. I started taking biotin and switched to biotin shampoo as recommended by my doctor. It doesn\u2019t make your hair grow by washing it but it makes your hair and roots stronger. And it worked. After using the whole bottle, my hair was stronger. I had a lot of new growth that was sticking around (the previous new growth fell out early on) and my hair was getting thicker. Eight months later, my hair is back to normal. It's longer and thicker than ever. I still use it twice a week and love it! I [don't love] the way it smells but others love it when they smell my hair.\" \u2014 Diane J. Huff Get it from Amazon for $13.95 . 7. A reviewer-loved retinol body lotion , which is also infused with ferulic acid, shea butter, vitamin E, and green tea \u2014 a wondrous combo that can help reduce the appearance of wrinkles, fine lines, crepy skin, and sun damage on your whole body. Because who said retinol was only for your face?? Like the reviewer below, you'll be kicking yourself for not snagging this sooner. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I could kick myself for not trying this sooner! It is my new favorite lotion... After one night of using this, I woke up to smooth, soft moisturized skin that wasn\u2019t itchy at all. This lotion goes on and absorbs beautifully. It\u2019s not too thin or thick, and the scent is sensational... It\u2019s not greasy or slick and does not have a residue that pills or transfers.\" \u2014 TickTokAlice Get it from Amazon for $18.99 . 8. A mattifying I Dew Care dry shampoo powder to dab on your roots anytime your hair is looking a bit too greasy for your liking, but you don't have time to wash it. The ultra-fine, hypoallergenic powder works to absorb oil, sweat, and dirt from your hair, making it look more fresh and voluminous. www.amazon.com , Amazon BTW, this is cruelty-free! Get a look at how it's used on TikTok . Promising review: \"I bought this in desperation after having elbow surgery, which left me unable to wash my own hair. I have tried countless dry shampoo sprays and have been disappointed every time. But this? Absolutely 100% game changer. It kept my hair feeling clean and oil free for several days at a time. It's easy to use, absorbs in quickly, no white residue on my dark hair, and you don't need much. I will never buy another brand again. This is my holy grail of dry shampoo .\" \u2014 Bad Girl Get it from Amazon for $18 (available in six shades). 9. A jar of internet-famous The Pink Stuff \u2014 this all-purpose cleaning paste has over 155,000 5-star reviews for a reason! \ud83c\udf1f It can help remove even the toughest dirt, grime, and rust from your appliances, walls, dishes, floors... you name it!

Promising review: \"I saw someone using this on TikTok and I was skeptical at first, but for $7 I thought I'd try it anyway. I am SO glad I bought this! I had a hair dye stain on the bottom of my bathtub for about a year from dyeing my hair at home, and I tried EVERYTHING...nail polish remover, Mr. Clean Magic Erasers, Scrubbing Bubbles foam spray, etc., with no avail. I also had calcium stains on the drain of my bathtub and sink that were a pain to get out. This product erased all of these stains with ease and made it look like they were never there! This is your sign to buy this...I am so happy!\" \u2014 Savannah M. Get it from Amazon for $5.97 . 10.

It's formulated with jojoba, grape seed, rose, and other oils to help gradually decrease pesky bumps and scars over time. www.amazon.com This product does not promise to work overnight. Apply this daily 2\u20133 times a day as long as needed. Be sure to be patient as the healing process takes time! Talk to your doctor before attempting to treat your keloid on your own, and learn more about keloids from Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: \"This product is amazing!! Truly a miracle product. I had an AWFUL keloid bump forming near my nose piercing about six weeks after getting it done, and it was just getting bigger and more irritated by the day; nothing was helping. I bought this stuff and started using it, and in less than two weeks, my huge keloid was completely gone! I was definitely skeptical and a little nervous when it didn\u2019t seem to be getting noticeably smaller after a week, but then the second week, it started totally disappearing, so make sure to give it some time to work if your bump is on the larger side. If you remain patient and apply it twice a day, it should do the trick! Also smells pretty good, definitely no bothersome or overwhelming scent which is appreciated in a product that I\u2019m applying on the nose area.\" \u2014 Jordan C. Get it from Amazon for $12.85 (also available in multipacks). 11. Onyx Professional Hard as Hoof Nail Strengthening Cream infused with vitamins, minerals, and emollients to assist fragile nails and help them avoid splitting, chipping, peeling, and cracking. If years of acrylics have done some damage to your nails (same) and you're looking to restore them to their pre-monthly-expensive-fill-ins state, this is here to help. amazon.com Plus, it smells like coconuts! Promising review: \"My natural nails are horrible! They are thin and brittle, and have a tendency to split, peel and break. Consequently, I wore acrylic nails for several years until I got tired of leaving so much money at the nail salon. When I soaked off the acrylics, my nails were, of course, worse than ever, and nothing I tried seemed to restore them to even their original condition until I found Hard as Hoof Nail Strengthening Cream. I rub this into my cuticles and nail beds several times a day, and after two months, my nails are hard and much thicker with no breaking or splitting. For the first time since I took off the acrylics, my nails are growing past my fingertips. This cream is a keeper, I just ordered my second jar, and I'll never again be without it.\" \u2014 M. Hill Get it from Amazon for $7.94 . 12. A foot file so you can scrape off the dead skin and calluses to make your feet soft and smooth again. No more snagging your socks with your dry heels. amazon.com Promising review: \"OMG, these should be standard issue for every human. I\u2019ve bought them all: the cheap foot files, the expensive ones, the Ped Egg, and even a foot file from that direct sales nail wrap company. None of those remotely compare to this one. I thought I was reduced to course heels forever; no more! With just one use, my heels are fabulous! The calluses this thing removed were absolutely disgusting, but I couldn\u2019t be happier. You won\u2019t be disappointed!!\" \u2014 JMart Get it from Amazon for $8.88 . 13. A pack of multipurpose dermaplaning razors for gently removing peach fuzz and dirt from your face and making it feel as smooth as a baby's bottom. Plus, you can use it to shape your eyebrows, too! Which means less money being spent on getting them waxed or threaded every other week. amazon.com Promising review: \"I used to pay a professional to dermaplane my face once a month to remove the peach fuzz, which makes me look older and makes the makeup application more cumbersome. I searched for years for a home product to use to save money and time. This is the closest I have been able to get to professional dermaplaning in the convenience of my home, on my time/schedule, and at a fraction of the price. Love it!\" \u2014 SEM1969 Get a three-count from Amazon for $5.94 (also available in a pack of nine). 14.

Promising review: \"Every winter, my fingers and knuckles crack and bleed. I've tried everything on the market to heal my hands. I received this hand cream yesterday, and when I put it on, I could tell right away that it was better than anything I'd tried. This stuff started working immediately. I filled all the cuts and cracks on my hands with this cream, and today, they are almost healed. I believe that this is the best hand cream ever made on earth.\" \u2014 Steve Get it from Amazon for $9.62 (also available in multipacks). 15.

It is the best, most high-quality, and most popular product you can find at a drugstore. I know people from all walks of life who use it \u2014 it\u2019s a universal favorite. It blends beautifully, has so many color options, and the applicator design is perfect for both use and portability. It\u2019s my go-to every time. I appreciate this product so much \u2014 100 out of 10! \" \u2014 AS Get it from Amazon for $8.80 (available in 24 shades, including color-correctors). 16.

Promising review: \"I don\u2019t usually do reviews on products, but for this one, I absolutely have to. I have 3c type hair and struggle with a lot a breakage, unmanageability, and moisture. When my mom mentioned this product to me, I didn\u2019t take her seriously because of the simple fact that we have two completely different hair textures. I never would have thought this brand would work on my hair ... I have never in my 22 years felt my hair like this. I feel like I have a completely different head of hair. This product is so amazing, and I will FOREVER be using this product in my hair regimen.\" \u2014 Theressa Hailey Get it from Amazon for $8.20 . 17. A powerful RMR-86 spray to help get rid of stubborn mold and mildew stains in your bathroom, on your patio, and more. And you don't even have to scrub! Just spray the area and watch the stains (and musty odors) vanish. amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought this RMR spray with low expectations, even with the good reviews. I sprayed a small patch in the evening and let it sit overnight. The next morning, the grout where I had sprayed was as white as if it were brand new. I decided to spray the entire wall and part of the roof. The next day, everything I sprayed had no visible mold. By the third night, I was pretty much spraying everything left in the shower. This stuff is amazing.\" \u2014 John Werner Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in three sizes and a two-pack). 18. Or a Skylarlife mold and mildew stain remover gel great for those tiny crevices, like silicone and rubber caulking \u2014 because those tubs and showers can get gross within the blink of an eye.

I just received this yesterday, applied it last night and this morning it\u2019s like I have a brand new bathroom. I\u2019m embarrassed to show 'before' and 'after' photos cuz it was so nasty, no matter how hard we scrubbed the mildew wouldn\u2019t go away. I almost cried when I saw my bathroom this mornings. Don\u2019t hesitate, buy this now, you won\u2019t regret it.\" \u2014 Bianca Green Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . 19. A descaling solution for an effective way to finally remove the mineral buildup and limescale from your coffee machine or espresso maker. It'll help extend the life of your machine and improve the taste of your coffee. Besides, your most-used kitchen appliance deserves some R-E-S-P-E-C-T. amazon.com Promising review: \"I had never even thought of descaling my 2-year-old Keurig before Amazon suggested it, but this stuff was cheap, I knew I was supposed to descale regularly, and I knew this kind of descaler wouldn't be as hard to rinse out as the smell of vinegar. I honestly wasn't expecting much, but the next morning, it took much less time for the water to heat up, and my coffee tasted twice as strong and rich as it did before descaling, which means the brewing temperature is higher now that the heating element isn't caked with mineral deposits. Now I feel a little silly for drinking mediocre coffee for so long.\" \u2014 Lenore Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a two-pack). 20. A bottle of Bread Beauty hair gel , a water-based styler that works for all hair types but is particularly formulated for those with coils and curls to lock in their natural pattern.

Promising review: \"I am not a gel person, but the reviews convinced me...I really thought my hair was going to be this messy, crunchy clump of hair, but it was the complete opposite! In love with the defining gel! Soft, defined, and shiny while keeping my volume! 1000% recommend!\" \u2014 Bakerspassion Get it from Amazon , from Sephora , or Bread Beauty Supply for $26. 21.

Promising review: \"I seriously can't believe how well these little tablets work. I had the most disgusting HydroFlask coffee mug \u2014 I tried everything. A bottle brush, different kinds of soap, vinegar, EVERYTHING, and there was still a seemingly impenetrable layer of black sludge inside. I let a tablet sit in each of my mugs for an hour or two, and the black sludge rinsed out COMPLETELY without even scrubbing. They look brand new. What a magical product. No weird smell or taste afterward, either. I liked it so much that I used it on another HydroFlask I use primarily to hold my Bloody Mary mix in the fridge. I couldn't put anything else in it because it would always taste like spicy tomato juice. Bottle Bright to the rescue! No residual smell or taste anymore. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING.\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get a 12-pack from Amazon for $8 . 22.

Promising review: \"Naturally, because of the ingredients, it has a strong smell. However, it does seem to leave my dog's skin feeling dry and provides good relief for her poor itchy skin. My dog Molly is a 9-pound mini dachshund whose little chest makes contact with the grass all the time, so her skin gets itchy and irritated. I\u2019ve been bathing her regularly with this shampoo, and it is giving her some relief. No more greasy, flaky skin. Her skin and fur is now dry and soft. \" \u2014 Climbyourarms Get it from Amazon for $9.87 (also available in a larger size). 23. A pack of cleaning erasers to make your kid's coffee table art project ~magically~ disappear. Just wet the sponge with water and wipe the surface down \u2014 that's it!

I was one step away from going to the dermatologist. I had severe dandruff that was so bad, I could shake my head and it would come off. With just a few uses per week, I got rid of all my flakes. My scalp also stopped burning from dryness. My hair has never been healthier. \" \u2014 Moo Moo Get it from Amazon for $15.88 . 25. Essence Lash Princess Mascara \u2014 almost 300,000 reviewers swear by this cruelty- and paraben-free, budget-friendly mascara (and I'm one of them)! It's less than $5 (the price of a latte), it's lengthening, volumizing, and way easier to apply than fake lashes. What else could ya ask for? Kayla Boyd / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Plus, a lot of reviewers say it's even better than the popular Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara! I have this mascara, and it is my FAVORITE (that's my face on the left)! I am constantly buying more when I run out. Plus, it's so dang affordable. Check out my in-depth Lash Princess mascara review . Promising review: \" Better than popular name brands at a fraction of the cost!! As a woman who has bought every mascara out there, from expensive department store exclusives (around $30+ ) to brands found in local drugstores...this mascara rivals and is somewhat BETTER than all I've bought before. It gives your lashes a thick, full length in a few coats. UNBELIEVABLE for the price!! I highly recommend it. You will see for yourself!! I am shocked at how great my lashes look in only two coats!! \" \u2014 Lisa Baker Get it from Amazon for $4.99 . 26. A pack of convenient blotting sheets made to help eliminate that T-zone oiliness on the go. They can be used with or without makeup on and will give your face a nice refresh if you're tired of having a constant oily shine as soon as you leave the house. amazon.com Promising review: \"I LOVE these oil-absorbing sheets! I tried them out a few years ago but didn't get around to writing a review until now. I've tried other blotting sheets, and they've either broken me out or just did not absorb all the oil. Every time I come back to these, I realize they are truly the best. I have SUPER-oily skin (and cystic acne, which I have the scars to show for), and this makes me feel sooo fresh and even calms down active pimples/acne. As you can see, it truly removes all of the oil and keeps it that way for several hours. Very cute design, too, and really easy to use and keep anywhere with you. Amazing price for what it does. If you're hesitating to buy it, just go for it!\" \u2014 Noopur D. Get a pack of 100 sheets from Amazon for $6.95 (available in three formulas and various pack sizes). 27. A pack of cleaning tablets to get rid of all the grime from inside your dishwasher and stop it from having any weird smells and hidden residue. Having a clean machine will help ensure your dishes are actually getting clean, too! amazon.com Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and just not getting clean. Then, I saw a product test review for Affresh in Good Housekeeping magazine. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway, so I added that to my order. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I am amazed!\" \u2014 Sheila Get a six-pack from Amazon for $8.95 . 28. A Briogeo leave-in conditioning spray formulated with coconut oil and argan oil to help all hair textures minimize frizz for up to 48 hours. Just spritz your hair with this for added shine, smoothness, and a very pleasant scent. Some reviewers say it makes brushing out tangles easier too! Sephora Review with all hair types, from curly to very straight , love it! Briogeo is a Black woman-founded business. Promising review: \"Smooth and hydrated hair. \ud83d\udc93 Instantly, yes. I have struggled to find a leave-in that doesn't make my hair feel greasy afterward, actually hydrates my hair, and uses effective ingredients. It smells amazing. I do appreciate that it is reasonably priced as well. Well done. \ud83d\udc4f\" \u2014 Chrispydao Get it from Amazon for $12+ (available in two sizes) or from Sephora for $25 . 29. A set of bestselling drawer dividers to keep your socks paired, your undies sorted, and prevent your bras from getting crushed and damaged. amazon.com The set includes four bins: a six-cell (good for scarves, tight, or leggings), an eight-cell (good for underwear, briefs, and ties), a seven-cell (ideal for bras), and a 24-cell (for socks). Promising review: \"No matter how neatly I fold my bras and underwear, they always seem to become a big jumble in the drawer. These organizers are perfect for keeping everything in place, and you won't forget about those items you own that end up buried at the back.\" \u2014 M. Hanson Get a set of four from Amazon for $13.87 (available in seven colors). 30. A pack of thin velvet hangers so you can fit more into your closet and not worry about all of your shirts sliding off right after you've just finished putting your laundry away (finally \u2014 I mean, it's been sitting on that chair for weeks). amazon.com Promising review: \"The difference in my closet because of the hangers alone is striking. I can finally shift clothes to the side to actually see what I have. While some may think that saving their money and dealing with a tight closet is worth it, I am completely sold on making the change. So happy I pulled the trigger. I've purchased 100 more just now so that I can do the same for my boyfriend's closet.\" \u2014 ChristineSD Get a 30-pack from Amazon for $16.29 (also available in 50- and 100-packs and in nine colors). 31. A stainless-steel tongue cleaner to scrape the grossness from your tongue that you probably didn't even realize was there (which can also help get rid of stinky breath). Prepare to be simultaneously disgusted and satisfied because yes, your tongue really is pink underneath all that brownish-yellow gunk! amazon.com Promising review: \"Unfortunately, I, like many, suffer from bad breath and have tried so many things to stop it. I read that sometimes it's the germs on your tongue that can cause it, so I went crazy trying to brush my tongue. Of course, we all know how that ends \u2014 gagging, watery eyes, and it still looks like that gross film is on your tongue. I finally decided that maybe it was time to get a tongue cleaner, and it had to be a stainless steel one because they are easier to clean and sterilize. This product is really easy to use, and I can get very far back on my tongue without activating my gag reflex. Also, it doesn't have the feeling that brushing with a toothbrush does. This cleaner just glides across my tongue, taking all the icky germs and bad breath with it. I love my nice new fresh breath and bolster of confidence!\" \u2014 jordanb Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in packs of two or 12). 32. A jetted tub cleaner so you can get the junk out of your tub and actually be able to have a nice, relaxing bubble bath. There might be plenty of dirt and dead skin cells hiding in those jets, and it has no business sticking around. Simply run your water, pour in some cleaner, and start your jets. amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought a walk-in tub 18 months ago. I was just looking for something to clean it with. I found this product and watched the video reviews. This product is just as advertised! Even better! When you use your air and water jets, you are recycling the tub water you are sitting in. Soap scum, skin cells, and mold buildup in the pipes. This stuff cleans it all out on the first application. 4 oz is all it takes. The first time I used this product, the tub water looked like I had thrown up in my tub. All this gunk was floating in the water. Great product. I will use this every week.\" \u2014 THOMAS O. MCCUTCHEON Get it from Amazon for $18.73 . 33. A carpet cleaner to once and for all make that huge spaghetti stain in the middle of your living room carpet ~disappear~. Just spritz some on the stain, wait a few seconds, and blot it up. It's like magic! amazon.com Promising review: \"It\u2019s a miracle in a bottle. My German shepherd mix decided to pull a black fountain pen out of my purse and chew it to pieces on my beige carpet while I was sleeping \u2014 this cleaner lifted the stain, and now it\u2019s like the devastation my dog caused never happened! As soon as I saw it lifting the ink, I got back on Amazon and bought more bottles. I will never let myself run out of this. I use it in my Bissell carpet cleaner for some crazy good cleaning power. I\u2019ve become that weird lady who goes around singing the praises of a cleaning product. No regrets.\" \u2014 L. Logan Get it from Amazon for $6.88 (also available in multipacks). 34. A shower door cleaner so you can finally get rid of the soap scum and hard water stains and make it so that the place where you clean yourself is, well, clean. It's super quick, easy, and effective and you wanna know the best part? It also leaves behind a coating that helps protect the glass from collecting more grossness over the next few weeks! Less cleaning is ALWAYS a win. amazon.com Promising review: \"This product works beautifully. I tried a lot of products to remove the hard water from my glass shower. I have to admit the first time I used it with a cloth, it was not very effective. The second time I used a nonabrasive sponge for glass, it turned out beautiful just like the first day the glass was installed.\" \u2014 EJP Get it from Amazon for $11.65 . 35. Plus! A grout paint marker to turn that icky brown color between your bathroom (or kitchen) tiles into a bright, clean white. Your floors will look brand-new again \u2014 without a bunch of tedious scrubbing (because who has time for that??). amazon.com This won't clean your grout, but it'll make it look brand-new. Promising review: \"I was pleasantly surprised by how far these went. I did the entire floor of my large master bathroom, plus a little of the shower, with one pen. It is pretty forgiving,g and you have quite a bit of working time before it dries completely. This was not a quick task, but it went faster than I thought it would. I was worried the white would look too bright, but it just makes everything look so much cleaner. Very happy with this product!\" \u2014 Jenelle Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in wide tip). 36. Heavy-duty cleaning wipes that'll help you quickly and easily clean up grease, oil, dirt, ink, makeup, food, and more on pretty much any surface. No need to take a chunk of time out of what you're doing to hunt down the mop, broom, cleaning sprays, etc. amazon.com Promising review: \"I think these wipes are made out of magic because they can clean just about anything with very little effort! One wipe cleaned my ENTIRE BATHTUB, including the hard water buildup and some residual soap scum. The wipe stayed wet for the entire use, and there was absolutely no sweating involved. I hate cleaning, but I was so pumped about the tub, I took wipe #2 to my hood vent, and good golly, it's like it's brand-new. I've told everyone I know to buy these.\" \u2014 JenM Get a 90-pack from Amazon for $14.98 . 37. A Clorox ToiletWand cleaning kit , which includes a wand, caddy, and six disposable refills, so you can eliminate the germs and stains in your toilet without having to reach down in there or touch anything gross. The scrub pads are preloaded with cleaner, so it's both convenient and effective. amazon.com Promising review: \"So, we have a toilet that belongs to the cats. We don't use it, we don't look at it, we like to pretend it does not exist. Even with semi-regular flushing, cat waste is pretty nasty stuff and builds up quickly in the bowl. One of these wands cleaned it up in a single session! Before-and-after pic attached (above).\" \u2014 Whitney Get it from Amazon for $11.98 . 38. A gas range cleaning spray that'll cut through grease with just a simple spray and wipe. Now you don't have to dread when your partner cooks, knowing that they never clean up the grease splatters. This will make it extra easy! amazon.com Here's why BuzzFeed Shopping editor Daniel Boan loves this stuff: \"This stuff is THE TRUTH. My roommate is the best, but let's just say wiping down the stove after cooking is not one of her favorite activities. I'm not particularly fond of doing the dishes, so I guess we're even. Anyway, I spray this on a few times a week, let it sit for about five minutes, then wipe it with a cloth, and it removes EVERYTHING. Like, every little spot of caked-on grease and burnt crumbs come off with just one wipe.\" Get a two-pack from Amazon for $17.98 . 39. A jewelry cleaning stick to restore your bling and have it looking like it did when it was first purchased. This convenient stick is preloaded with a formula that helps to remove dirt and oils, reduces fine scratches, repels grime, and provides shine! If your engagement ring has seen better days, but you don't want to spend the money on professional cleaning, this will help it get its sparkle back. amazon.com Promising review: \"This little pen brush is incredible! I wasn't sure if it would work well on my emerald engagement ring since it's mostly advertised for diamonds, but I thought I'd give it a try. I have been wearing the ring since getting engaged in October, and even though I had it cleaned at the jeweler's in April, it just didn't seem as bright as it was when it was new, and I thought it would just always be a little cloudy. But after cleaning it once with the Dazzle Stik, I was blown away by the difference \u2014 it looks as bright and sparkly as when I first got it! I'm so glad I didn't buy an ultrasonic cleaner, since this is so much less expensive and easier and gentler. It took me less than a minute to clean, and I can do it whenever I want! And it's honestly better than when the jeweler cleaned it. So thrilled!\" \u2014 KFray Get it from Amazon for $9.48 . 40. A bestselling and surprisingly inexpensive Arvazallia argan oil hair mask that'll strengthen and restore weak and damaged hair. It'll make your locks look shiner and feel healthier (and who doesn't want shiny, healthy hair??). Sure, there are a lot of hair masks out there, but more than 300 reviewers claim this is one of the BEST. amazon.com Reviewers with 4C hair , curly hair , and straight, dyed hair rave about this! Promising review: \"My hair is very thin and curly. The ends are damaged from heat and color, causing my hair to look even more unruly. I do oil treatments once a week and only wash my hair two to three times a week, but NOTHING has made my hair feel like this product does. There is an immediate difference as soon as this product touches my hair. It leaves my hair feeling so silky, even after I rinse it out and dry my hair.\" \u2014 Melissa Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . 41. A rubber broom basically guaranteed to make all of your floors look brand-spanking new. The 100% natural rubber brush picks up hair (both pet and human) like a magnet and easily gathers it from carpets, rugs , hardwood, and linoleum. Plus, it has a built-in squeegee on the other side to assist you with liquid spills! Emma Lord/BuzzFeed Promising review: \"I have two dogs \u2014 a terrier mix and a short-hair dachshund mix. I have a navy woven couch that LOVES my dachshund's fur. I have tried pretty much everything to get the fur out \u2014 traditional lint roller, those blue fuzzy lint rollers, special vacuum attachments, etc. The terrier's fur comes out great with all of those options. The dachshund's fur, much like the dachshund herself, remains stubbornly on my couch. I got this product as the new 'let's see if it works' item of the month with low expectations. THE FUR ACTUALLY CAME OUT GUYS. It acts like a broom for my couch \u2014 sweeping the fur (with some elbow grease) basically onto the floor where I vacuum it up! Give this a try if my story sounds pretty similar to yours!\" \u2014 Janielle Get it from Amazon for $19.76 . 42. A wrinkle releaser and fabric freshening spray for mornings when you really don't have time to iron, but you also really need to wear THAT specific shirt for your work presentation. amazon.com Promising review: \"This is literally like an iron in a bottle. It's fantastic. This morning, my shirt had a crease from being folded, but I didn't have time to change, so I misted just one spray on the shirt, shook it out while I was wearing it, and the crease was gone. I cannot express how much I love this! I spray it over my shirts and shake them out a couple of times, then hang them u,p and they are completely wrinkle-free, and it smells like everything just came right out of the laundry, which is also a plus.\" \u2014 Kayla Get a two-pack, plus a travel-size from Amazon for $16.99 (available in five scents and various packs and sizes). 43. An all-purpose scrubber kit \u2014 it comes with three different brushes you can attach to your drill and use to remove any of that hard-to-clean grossness that's caked up on your stove, grill, shower, or floor. What would have taken you hours to scrub can now be accomplished in minutes! You're welcome. amazon.com And if you don't have a drill, here's one on Amazon for $39.59 \u2014 it has over 16,000 5-star ratings! Promising review: \"I bought this on a whim because my walk-in shower is just a pain to clean. I'm 51, and I guess I've just been old school with how I clean, hand scrubbing for years. T he FIRST time I used this to clean my shower, it took five minutes, AND it scrubbed my shower more clean than it has been in years. In the corners, the floor, the glass door...everything came out squeaky clean. I'm NEVER cleaning my shower by hand again.\" \u2014 Terry Get it from Amazon for $18.95 (available in six bristle stiffnesses).

Emporium Make it easier on yourself, by getting these cheaper versions of pricey Disney souvenirs that we found. DISCLOSURE: This post may contain affiliate links, which means when you click a link and make a purchase, we receive a commission. One thing you\u2019re guaranteed to see at Disney World, are little ones launching bubbles everywhere out of their bubble wands. Join the fun with a cheaper option, with this Disney Mickey Bubble Wand ! \u00a9Amazon Bubble wands are extremely popular at the Parks, they\u2019re one of the most sold items. This bubble wand isn\u2019t much different. The Mickey head shaped wand features sound and lighting effects \u2014 it will blink blue, green, and red. The wand also comes with solution. We think this is a great alternative for kids! You can order these before your trip and already have them ready to go for the parks! View on Amazon This Mickey and Friends Autograph Book is a great deal for those who love to get signatures from their favorite Disney characters! Don\u2019t worry about getting a more expensive autograph book, when you can get one like this. \u00a9Amazon It comes with a Mickey pen and some alphabet stickers, so you can personalize you\u2019re book. We love the cover featuring Mickey and his pals (and sweetheart). The fireworks and castle give it a nice pop as well. Best of all, the item is 46% off at the moment! This one is under $10. The ones in the parks will run you over $20. View on Amazon You\u2019ve probably seen a lot of Disney goers rocking this portable charger. The FuelRod Portable Charger Kit is a must-have! The kit comes with two chargers, and includes all cables and adapters needed for you phone. We LOVE using portable chargers! The kit does come with a rechargeable backup power bank as well. The cool thing about these is you can swap dead one\u2019s for new recharged ones. Just find a kiosk located at different spots around Disney World, and swap out. These are about half the price if you buy them before your trip! View on Amazon Here\u2019s a little shopping hack for you Disney lovers. If you look at the Disney Store online, you can sometimes find Disney ears for a little bit of a discount. We especially love these Minnie Mouse Polka Dot Ears ! \u00a9DisneyStore The reason they can be cheaper online than in person, is because they are often a part of sales. Whereas they almost never go on sale at a Disney Park! These ones are currently $10 off. View Online Like we mentioned with the ears, the same can be said for Spirit Jersey esc tops. It\u2019s always smart to look online first before shopping at the park, because you never know if the one you like could be on sale. Take a look at this Disney World Logo Pullover Sweater ! \u00a9DisneyStore Although it isn\u2019t a typical Disney iconic Spirit Jersey, this is pretty close to. This sweater has the Disney World logo at the front, and has the classic full name print on the back. It\u2019s available at an amazing price right now! View Online The same thing can also be said about designer items \u2014 crazy online shopping hack right! Designer items are very rarely ever marked down at the Parks, but online that\u2019s a different story. We love the style of this Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck Backpack ! \u00a9DisneyStore This bag is designed by Lily Pulitzer ! We love the Hawaiin type theme to the backpack. The colors really pop and mesh well together, and the subtle add of Minnie and Daisy is a chefs kiss. You won\u2019t believe the price it\u2019s going for right now! You\u2019re going to want this for your next Disney trip. View Online You\u2019ve probably caught onto the trend. If you buy Disney souvenirs online, you have a good chance of running into a sale. Whereas in the parks, you most likely won\u2019t find a sale. This applies even to ornaments, like this Cinderella Sketchbook Ornament ! \u00a9DisneyStore We love this ornament capturing the moment Cinderella leaves the ball. She\u2019s got her glass slipper in hand, and the clock has struck midnight. Even Jaq and Gus are featured on the ornament. It\u2019s available online for UNDER $10!

A female jogger is firing back after being criticized for carrying a gun while working out in public. Mikaela Dieppa made her open carry admission in a TikTok clip posted earlier this week, which has clocked up more than 4.2 million views. The mother-of-one, who lives in South Carolina, initially showed off her gun holster as she detailed what she wears while jogging. \u201c[This is my] run outfit of the day. I\u2019m open carrying,\u201d Dieppa declared, flaunting her fashionable fit ahead of her workout. \u201cMy holster is from Amazon, my sports bra and shorts are from Lululemon\u2026 and my favorite running shoes, I\u2019m wearing my Hokas.\u201d 3 Mikaela Dieppa rocks a gun holster as part of her fashionable workout fit. tiktok/@mikaeladieppa Explore More Travelers reveal their most bizarre culture shocks when visiting other countries: 'Never get used to it' Hotel guest who paid extra to see the ocean appalled by 'inner city' view \u2014 staff told her to 'lean over the balcony' Tourist couple caught having sex in the middle of the street @mikaeladieppa Protect yourself ladies \ud83d\udc9b #opencarry #womanrunner #gunsafety #runningtips \u266c original sound \u2013 Mikaela Dieppa She defended her decision to be openly armed while exercising, saying: \u201cFor all the people who say I should be concealed carrying when I am on my run, you\u2019re probably not a female who has men slow down and stop to watch them running.\u201d Dieppa claimed that leering men quickly leave her alone when they realize she\u2019s carrying a gun. \u201cProtect yourself ladies,\u201d the locked and loaded brunette captioned the clip. Dieppa told The Post on Saturday: \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m scared or paranoid, it\u2019s a fact that women get assaulted in broad daylight all the time, even when taking precautions.\u201d As for the gun, the runner says: \u201cI\u2019d rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.\u201d The mom revealed that other women have asked whether they should take similar safety measures, and Dieppa advises: \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll need it [the gun], but chances aren\u2019t zero.\u201d 3 The gun-toting mama defended her decision to open carry after being criticized by TikTok trolls. tiktok/@mikaeladieppa Dieppa\u2019s exercise accessory divided viewers, with some cheering her decision to flaunt the firearm. \u201cEverybody should open carry \u2026.I think everybody should have a gun on them in public,\u201d one defender declared. \u201cCrime would go away.\u201d \u201cOpen carry every time,\u201d another proponent proclaimed. \u201cDon\u2019t start nothing, there won\u2019t be nothing.\u201d However, others said Dieppa\u2019s desire to arm herself while exercising was a sad indictment of the American way of life. 3 Dieppa encouraged other women to protect themselves while working out in public.

A cordless grass trimmer that'll help you tackle hard-to-reach areas in your garden bed or simply get the job done if you are the proud owner of a tiny patch of grass. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This tool is awesome and it lasts a long time for trimming around your plants. I love it and recommend for any one who needs to trim around their plants and/or vegetable tree. Mine is a banana tree and was not kept trimmed around it but after getting this tool I'm able to trim around without damaging or making a mess around it.\" \u2014 IC Get it from Amazon for $31.99 (available in three colors). 2. A variety of sunflower seeds to transform that boring patch of dirt in your yard into a photo shoot\u2013worthy garden without the stress of hand selecting which flowers to plant. Alexa, play \"Sunflower\" by Harry Styles. www.amazon.com Created by Nature is a small business! Promising review: \"Planted a handful of the seeds in our front lawn area. Few months later, and we had a spectacular color array. Great flowers!\" \u2014 Shane Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . 3. A standing weeder (without the chemicals!) in case you've found your dream home, but, unfortunately, it came with a grass full of dandelions. Unwind after a busy day at the office with some therapeutic weeding that won't hurt your back. \ud83d\udc4d www.amazon.com Made with a bamboo handle and powder-coated steel, it uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. Grampa's Weeder is a small business! Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy, has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard, and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun, but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 4. A programmable timer to work some Fairy Godmother-like magic on your hose and transform it into a sprinkler. Bibbidi, Bobbidi, Boo-tiful lawn! Amazon Reviewers mention it's worth using this product with a water hammer arrester . Promising review: \"These timers have been around for a long time. My dad used them for his garden for years without any issue. The batteries last a long time in these things as well. I\u2019m able to program what days of the weeks to water, how frequently (every 12 hours for twice a day), and how long to water each time. Then just leave the faucet on and you\u2019re good to go. If you want to do another watering on hot days or use the hose for another purpose just click the manual button to trigger a manual watering no need to disconnect.\" \u2014 Taylor Get it from Amazon for $35.81 . 5. A row of colorful flower pots with draining holes and hooks that'll brighten up your deck with very minimal effort. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These are adorable. I love the colors. They're lightweight and won't hold more than one or two flowers, but they're perfect for the project I did.\" \u2014 JDub Get 10 from Amazon for $18.59 (available in three styles). 6. A fast-acting lawn repair formula made up of grass seeds, mulch, and soil amendment will undo all the damage your beloved doggo (who, obviously, can't help but pee all over your grass) has done to the yard. Now, back to trying to teach Fido *not* to dig up the new grass... www.amazon.com Promising review : \"I used this in the spring to fill out our lawn more, and it worked great! I was worried because I feel like you always hear grass seed horror stories, but I just raked our lawn good, spread seeds all over, and watered it once (sometimes twice) per day and it filled the lawn in beautifully! \" \u2014 Mariah Get it from Amazon for $16.44+ (available in five sizes). 7. A hedge trimmer that'll ensure your neighbors will be peeking over your fence to get a glimpse at how fabulous those bushes look. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have hesitated for years to buy a hedge trimmer but took the plunge on this one. I am pleasantly surprised; lightweight, easy to handle, cuts my shrubs back easily, and trims my 10-foot tall Cyprus cedar with ease!! I'm 76, wish I had bought one years ago!!\" \u2014 George Goddling Get it from Amazon for $39 . 8. Pruning shears , for anyone who has successfully created their own magical rose garden in their yard. Better get yourself a glass jar too to display it like in Beauty and the Beast . Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I purchased these as a gift for my mother who gardens extensively. She thanked me again for them today, declaring that these were the best pruners she has ever owned (she has been at it over 50 years). She cuts the branches off her trees and shrubs, then further trims them into small sections to fit in the recycle trash bags. It is her great joy to work in the yard made even my pleasant through the use of these pruners.\" \u2014 A. Kelly Get it from Amazon for $18.95. 9. And a long-handled lopper to help you can trim any overgrown bushes or trees in your yard, a must-have for anyone who isn't Edward Scissorhands. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Light, easy to use for pruning my trees, but sturdy. Pruning is effortless. So well-engineered. I can't recommend these enough. And they're affordable. My favorite garden tool now. I don't like heavy tools that I can't maneuver or hurt my hands. This is perfect.\" \u2014 Patsy Get them from Amazon for $28.05+ (available in five styles). 10. A galvanized steel planter bed to bring a bit of organization to your yearly garden of veggies and herbs \u2014 this will keep 'em all housed in one easy-to-tend-to spot instead of plopping them directly into the ground. www.amazon.com I have similar garden beds in my yard! I like how it showcases the vegetable garden itself instead of just digging out a spot in our lawn. We had success with our veggies last year, so my husband and I invested in a third planter for this year. Promising review : \"This raised bed is very affordable. The bed looks thin and flimsy at first, but once it is set up, it is very sturdy even though it is very light to carry around empty. I also appreciate that this is a foot tall and not too shallow like some other raised beds being sold . This is an excellent product and I would recommend it highly for what you are paying for.\" \u2014 JT Get it from Amazon for $49.99 . 11. A Scotts seed spreader you'll adore because 1. it comes fully assembled (thankfully) and 2. it'll ensure your grass seed and fertilizer are spread nice and evenly without an extra effort required. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This model is definitely a cut above the other spreaders made by Scott. It is quite well constructed and has lots of nice features like a large hopper, four drop holes, and dual spreader mechanisms. The wheels on this are very nice as well and the edge guard feature works well. Very easy and effective to use and should provide years of use if maintained properly. Beats the pants off of every other spreader I have used. And it's attractive to boot!\" \u2014 Gila Monster Get it from Amazon for $44.97+ (available in four styles). 12. And a seeding square kit , so planting your lil' sprouts won't turn into a game of guess and check. You'll know *exactly* what pattern you planted your basil seeds in this year. www.amazon.com It also comes with a measuring stick called a dibbler that pushes down the dirt to the correct depth for you to drop your seeds. The holes are color coded to let you know exactly where to plant seeds of different varieties. Promising review: \"Love this thing! I have been gardening for a while and this takes all of the guess work out of spacing . I used this for the first time this spring using the planting chart/guide and it has worked out perfectly. I have had little to no weeds (I mean come on, you're gonna get some weeds). Planting per the Seed Square will for the most part choke out the weeds, while promoting growth for the plants. I even used this to plant growing plants and not just seeds. Just put the square on the ground used the stick to mark the spot and dug a hole where it was marked. Simple enough. Would highly recommend. Super easy!\" \u2014 Jennifer Geisel Get it from Amazon for $29.95 . 13. And vegetable, fruit, and herb markers to help you *actually* keep track of what you planted where \u2014 each stick is individually sold and with over 40 options to choose from you should have no problem finding exactly what you need to keep your garden in check.

My Little Belleville / Etsy My Little Belleville is a small business based in Salt Lake City, Utah that sells kitchenware, stationery, and other home goods. Promising review: \"Such a fun way to add more of a thrill into our gardening skills. One set was for my daughter and one for a friend who shares the green thumb phenomena. Adorable designs.\" \u2014 Barbara Get them from My Little Belleville on Etsy for $17.25 (available in seven styles). 16. Or garden gloves with claws that'll make you feel like the Lady Gaga of gardening and make digging in the dirt both easier and more fashionable. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"If you're like me, I typically ditch the gloves when I'm weeding because I can't get a good hold on the smaller weeds. Not with these gloves! They help me dig up those small weeds quickly. I thought I'd have a hard time picking things up because of the claws, but no. They make weeding so much quicker, and save my nails and hands in the process.\" \u2014 MomOfR&D Get them from Amazon for $6.37 (available in four colors). 17. A scent-free mosquito repellent to keep those lil' bloodsucking buggers at bay while you're trying to plant your daisies or pick your cherry tomatoes. Amazon This device uses scent-free repellent mats using naturally occurring repellents found in plants to rid of mosquitoes. Promising review: \"It doesn't smell. It doesn't make noise. It doesn't get hot. It just clears the mosquitos and only mosquitoes! I am the person a mosquito will find from miles away even in my house. The only one they find in a room full of people. I live in a tropical climate and never have a moment's peace in my garden. I've used sprays, foggers, candles, torches, the list goes on. This is the first time I've been able to sit on my patio in peace, even the cat was safe. Already ordered another for a friend and put the refills on subscribe and save.\" \u2014 J&J Get it from Amazon for $17.99+ (available in 13 colors). 18. A soaker hose you can attach to the hose you already own to provide your bushes, plants, and trees with the shower they've always dreamt of (especially during those too-hot summer days). Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I bought a couple of different soaker hoses and this is the best by far. Unlike the rubbery ones that are heavier and more difficult to intertwine and stay where you place them within your plantings, these are easy to curve around, reposition, or remove . They have clamps to securely connect the hose at the hose ends, which helps avoid leaks or breaks. By comparison, the other kind that has the texture of recycled tires, without clamps, leaked at the connection points and disconnected/failed, resulting in the separation of the hose from the hose ends. Any leaking tends to negate the whole function of the soaker hose. In contrast, this style and brand provides a steady, consistent drip along the hose exactly what I want. So far, durability has been good, and the hose will fold up nicely for storage during the winter months.\" \u2014 Gail Get it from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in seven sizes). 19. A soil test kit to relay the moisture in your plant's soil as well as its pH and light levels so you'll know once and for when it needs to be watered. www.amazon.com This device has two needles to ensure accuracy and doesn't require batteries. Just push it 2\u20134 inches into the ground and select what you want to test for. Promising review: \"I have A LOT of plants, with varied water and light exposure requirements. They would probably all be dead from drought or overwatering if not for this little gadget. So simple to use. I recommend it to my fellow plant-lovers in our social media group.\" \u2014 M. Brooks Get it from Amazon for $7.99 . 20. Knee pads you can count on to make the many hours you typically spend gardening on a Saturday morning a bit more comfortable \u2014 a must-have for anyone whose knees simply aren't what they used to be. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These are the best knee pads I have ever used. They allow me to stay on my knees for an extended period of time without getting uncomfortable. I have worn them for 9-hour working days without any issues with fit, adjustment, or comfort. They have great cushioning and are very comfortable, but in my opinion what really makes them better than most other knee pads on the market is the fact that they have two adjustable straps with slip buckles instead of one of the straps being Velcro . \u2014 Shannon Huett Get them from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in two styles). 21. An expandable garden hose to help you water your grass, the vegetables you planted and prayed will actually grow, and your flower bed without worrying about any kinks getting in the way. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Have used this for about three weeks, watering flowers, grass and washing cars. Have used it almost every day in some way or another. It's very light, easy to maneuver, and doesn't kink. However, I think that's because I followed the directions on the box for how to unwind it for the first time. When I was first unraveling, it kinked in multiple places, so I had to carefully unravel and lay it out fully extended before I even hooked it up to the water source. Has been kink-free ever since.\" \u2014 Sean Cotter Get it from Amazon for $10.06+ (available in seven sizes). 22. An adjustable gardening bench complete with padding for your knees and handles on the sides to assist you in getting up from the crouched position you've likely been in for a *tad* too long while tending to your veggies. It can even be turned into a seat so you can take a true break! www.amazon.com Promising reviews: \"This is great for the garden. It keeps my knees out of the stickers, and the padding is very comfortable, it helps me get up and down \u2014 it is easy to maneuver around the garden and in between the rows. I haven't tried sitting on it, but I'm heavy, and it feels very sturdy under me. Pockets deep enough for tools and seed packets, easy to remove and wash if necessary.\" \u2014 Cpt Dragon \"I bought this for my mother as she had knee surgery, and now she can sit on it while working in her flower and vegetable boxes. Definitely will purchase it again.\" \u2014 Johnnette Murray Get it from Amazon for $23.99 . 23. A plant supporter that'll give your tomato plants and bushes a bit more support so they can grow big and tall \u2014 since they're powder-coated in green they wont' ruin your garden's *~aesthetic~*. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These plant supports each consist of two semi circles that fit together to encircle the plant. I have two snake plants that are getting taller and needed support. These plant stakes are working perfectly . They can easily be inserted into the soil to the desired height, and the green color obscures their appearance. My plants look prettier and stronger now that they are standing tall.\" \u2014 A.Consumer Get a pack of four from Amazon for $14.99+ (also available in an eight-pack). 24. A garden colander to fill up with all of the fruits and veggies you've worked so hard to grow from little seedlings \u2014 wash 'em off outside with the hose to prevent getting dirt all over your kitchen. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I got this for my elderly parents. They always put out a small garden. I thought this would be perfect for them to gather and carry their vegetables in. Another good part is you can rinse them in it, too! My mom said it was too pretty to use for that, but she uses it. It\u2019s convenient!\" \u2014 Samantha Bastin Get it from Amazon for $19.29+ (available in two colors). 25. A pack of seeds that contain, basically, any kind of vegetable you'd want to grow in your garden \u2014 beets, cucumbers, cabbage, butternut squash, and more.

Organo Republic is a small business! Promising review : \"I purchased it for my mother as a gift and I absolutely love the product. Huge variety and very affordable price! The package looks great and each seed bag is individually labeled along with a QR that takes you directly to all the information you need pertaining to that type of vegetables. Love it.\" \u2014 V. G Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (also available in a a variety of 15 and 25 veggie seeds). 26.

All my plants look full and healthy with little to no effort on my part! I am so amazed that for teacher gifts this year, I am giving terrariums and will include a shaker of Joyful Dirt to go with each.

Shuls, Real Clear Wire Skip to content The \u2018learn to code\u2019 fad is done: Why schools should educate for citizenship By James V. Shuls, Real Clear Wire April 12, 2025 Within the past decade or so we have witnessed something remarkable in education \u2013 the rise and fall of a fad we were promised would revolutionize K-12 education. In the 2010s, tech moguls and others began pushing schools to teach students coding skills, often at the expense of other topics. In 2013, Code.org launched with the claim that every student should learn to code. States began promoting computer science as a core subject. By 2016, President Obama put his weight behind the movement with the Computer Science for All initiative. Fast forward to today, and the experts now tell us students may no longer need those once-prized coding skills. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has said the rise of artificial intelligence is making programming skills less relevant. In a leaked memo, Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman reportedly stated that AI would likely replace most software engineers. Most recently, entrepreneur and former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya echoed these claims: \u201cThe engineer\u2019s role will be supervisory, at best, within 18 months.\u201d What does Palihapitiya suggest students study instead? \u201cPhilosophy, psychology, history, physics, and English writing.\u201d Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! The coding fad follows a well-established pattern. A movement is launched with great fanfare, grows rapidly, pushes for widespread reforms, and then fades into irrelevance. Before coding, there was the 21st century \u201cskills\u201d craze, in which schools were told they needed to prepare students for jobs that didn\u2019t yet exist. The recurring theme of many fads in education is their departure from the timeless purposes of education. Rather than cultivating the intellectual and moral virtues necessary for self-government, they focus on workforce readiness. But to sustain a constitutional republic, the public must have both skills. This lesson is clear if we turn to the women of the Founding era. On August 14, 1776 \u2013 barely a month after the Declaration of Independence was signed \u2013 Abigail Adams wrote to her husband John, responding to his complaints about the poor education of young men: \u201cIf you complain of neglect of Education in sons, what shall I say with regard to daughters, who every day experience the want of it?\u201d Most women at the time were not given a proper classical education. They did not read the Greek and Roman poets or moral philosophers. They were unfamiliar with Virgil, Ovid, or leading English thinkers like John Milton and John Locke. Instead, they were taught what we might call \u201c18th-century skills\u201d \u2013 needlework, music, drawing, and etiquette. Abigail Adams knew that an education that focused on domestic tasks or job preparation was insufficient for a free and self-governing society. \u201cIf we mean to have Heroes, Statesmen and Philosophers,\u201d she wrote, \u201cwe should have learned women.\u201d It was exactly that kind of education, rooted in the classics, that propelled several leading women of the time to prominence. Mercy Otis Warren, tutored in classical literature alongside her brothers, authored poetry and satirical plays that supported the Revolution and stirred the affections of the colonists. A similar story can be told of the enslaved poet Phillis Wheatley, who inspired the young nation through her verse. Influenced by the evangelical minister George Whitefield, Wheatley\u2019s enslavers provided her with a classical education alongside their own children. Upon receiving a poem from Wheatley, George Washington wrote, \u201cThe style and manner exhibit a striking proof of your great poetical talents.\u201d Adams, Warren, and Wheatley stood out because they were educated for citizenship . That\u2019s what an education grounded in the classics \u2013 the best that has been written and thought in human history \u2013 can do. It produces people equipped to think deeply, to reason morally, and to lead wisely. Americans intuitively yearn for this type of education. In a recent poll of more than 2,400 people conducted by the Institute for Governance and Civics at Florida State University, participants were asked what would make U.S. education better. The most popular responses \u2013 selected by roughly 85% of respondents \u2013 included requiring schools to teach the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and mandating an approach to civics that focuses on the Constitution. Seventy-eight percent supported requiring students to demonstrate competence in American history to graduate high school. And 67% favored an education focused on the great texts of Western Civilization \u2013 the very texts Adams, Warren, and Wheatley read. It may be time to move on from coding, but the danger is that we\u2019ll simply replace it with yet another skill set that will soon become obsolete. That would be short-sighted. Today\u2019s students must be trained for the job market \u2013 and also prepared for the responsibilities of self-government. Job skills change. Technologies fade. But an education grounded in civic understanding is timeless and can provide long-term stability to our republic. James V. Shuls, Ph.D., is the Head of K-12 Education Reform at the Institute for Governance and Civics at Florida State University.

Reuters reports that the company, which makes phone cases, power banks, adapters, cables, and more, raised prices on a fifth of its products since Thursday. The move comes as the company passes the cost of US tariffs onto its US-based customers. Some 127 Anker products have seen an average increase of 18% since Thursday last week, with the majority of those occurring after Monday, April 7, when U.S. President Donald Trump added an extra 50% import duty on Chinese goods, according to data from e-commerce services provider SmartScout. Reuters notes that, on an investor call earlier in the week, Anker had said that it was able to raise prices \u201cas it had bargaining power and because its rivals were mainly Chinese and under similar tariff pressure, but did not provide specifics.\u201d Ultimately, more companies could well choose to follow suit. Tariffs make it more costly for companies to bring goods from specific countries into the United States. One way that those companies can negate the additional costs while protecting their profits is to increase prices, effectively passing the cost of the tariffs onto customers. The result is that US-based customers pay more for products as a result of the tariffs that were imposed by its leaders.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16. Review the configuration of all devices.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

It's lacks a reverse switch, which is problematic if you should be working in limited space (as it is designed to do) and can get stuck if the bolt doesn't have enough clearance to be removed. vid1900 HF Quinn has a set of low profile sockets that fit this, although often, they are more money than the genuine Astro ones.

The Tekton is beefier than the Astro Tools, and is double ended with a flex head on one end and a fixed box on the other end. It's 17 inches long, a bit shorter than the Astro Tools. Tekton web site claims it has a proof torque of 450 ft lbs, nearly double the ASME standard for a 22mm flex head. Astro Tools doesn't give any info on proof torque for their wrench. Tekton is $36 but worth it. 4 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link 2 Replies stasis Yesterday Apr 12, 2025 5:49 PM 5,909 Posts Joined Apr 2008 Yesterday Apr 12, 2025 5:49 PM stasis Yesterday Apr 12, 2025 5:49 PM 5,909 Posts Quote from vid1900 : HF Quinn has a set of low profile sockets that fit this, although often, they are more money than the genuine Astro ones.

Discover SCENE Jianwei Xun, the supposed Hong Kong philosopher whose book \"Hypnocracy\" claims Elon Musk and President Donald Trump use utopian promises and empty language, never really existed, at least not physically. Instead, the acclaimed author was a \"collaborative\" creation between Andrea Colamedici, an Italian publisher, and two AI tools \u2013 Claude from Anthropic and ChatGPT from OpenAI. \"I wanted to write a book that would help people better understand the new ways power manifests itself,\" Colamedici told Decrypt . But it wasn't until after an investigative report from L'Espresso that Xun's website was updated to acknowledge the experiment, snapshots from Wayback Machine reviewed by Decrypt show. Still, the book received critical acclaim. L\u2019Espresso reports that L\u2019Opinion , a French daily, had detailed how President Emmanuel Macron had \u201cappreciated\u201d Xun\u2019s writings. Earlier in February, a roundtable at the World AI Cannes Festival extensively discussed Xun\u2019s ideas. \u00c9ditions Gallimard, a leading French publisher, has committed to a new translation from the Italian original, after the first edition in French from Philosophie Magazine. A Spanish translation from Editorial Rosamer\u00f3n is slated for release on April 20. Vibe philosophy? Xun was \"an exercise in ontological engineering,\" Colamedici explained in a post-revelation interview with Le Grand Continent . While this experiment with AI looked novel, critics point out the book could be in trouble. The European Union's AI Act , approved in March 2024, considers failure to label AI-generated content a serious violation \u2013 a requirement critics claim Colamedici's experiment disregarded. In previous versions of its bio, Xun was described as a \"Hong Kong-born cultural analyst and philosopher\" who studied at \u201cDublin University.\u201d That wasn\u2019t true. According to an anonymous source from the University College of Dublin's philosophy department, no person named \"Jianwei Xun\" exists in their database or those of other Dublin-based universities. \"The fact that the author had inverted the Chinese order 'surname-name' was an immediate red flag,\" Laura Ruggieri, a Hong Kong-based researcher, told Decrypt , explaining how she spotted inconsistencies as early as February. Ruggieri previously taught semiotics\u2014the study of symbols and signs\u2014at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. She asked her colleagues about Xun. Nobody knew who that was. \u201cNot a single one of them has ever met Xun or heard his name,\u201d Ruggieri said. \u201cIf Colamedici had used his real name and admitted that AI had written the book, no one would have bought it.\u201d Responding to those allegations to Decrypt , Colamedici claimed these were deliberate clues \"left for those willing to question and investigate,\u201d claiming the revelation was \"predetermined.\" \u201cWe actually did everything possible to make Xun\u2019s non-existence evident to anyone with even minimally inquisitive eyes,\u201d Colamedici said. Colamedici insists that AI did not write the book. Instead, Claude and ChatGPT \"served as interlocutors.\" In the words of Xun The book describes itself as a \"journey into the fractured mirror of modern reality,\" and discusses how Musk and Trump have constructed an alternate reality through obsessive repetition. It was written \"for those who suspect that the world they see is only a shadow of something far more complex,\" its Amazon blurb claims. Xun's thoughts center on \"hypnocracy,\" describing a regime that exerts control through \"algorithmic modulation\" of collective consciousness instead of censorship. In English: fake news. Xun claims that Trump's speeches and social media posts create conditions of uncertainty. Trump \"empties language: his words, repeated endlessly, become empty signifiers, devoid of meaning yet charged with hypnotic power,\" Xun wrote. Xun claims Musk makes promises \u201cdestined not to materialize,\u201d by \u201cflooding our imagination\u201d with ventures such as space colonization and neural interfaces. \"Together they modulate desires, rewrite expectations, colonize the unconscious,\" the AI philosopher wrote. Spokepeople for Musk and Trump did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s request for comment.

A flexible drain snake that'll get out all those clumps of hair and gunk so the bathtub stops filling up past your ankles every time you shower. Just stick it down the drain, twist it, and the ridges at the end will catch all the goop, making sure it all comes out. Amazon, www.amazon.com This pack contains a reusable handle and five single-use heads that you just remove and dispose of after handling your clogged pipes. Promising review: \"Wow. Best thing ever. Seriously. I have had tweezers and sticks and plumbers and chemicals trying to get my master sink to drain. Plumber even said I need an entirely new faucet to get the drain plug part because they don't sell those separately. Well, I have two sinks, a tub, and shower that all match so that was not a valid solution. Doubt I can find the same model. So I bought this thing, stuffed it down, and pulled up hair and black muck. Did it about eight times quickly, ran the water, went right down the drain. Seriously. This is the best tool ever and the best $20 I have ever spent. Everyone with a sink needs this tool. Seriously.\" \u2014 juliejules Get a five-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in other sets and styles). 2.

I am currently waiting for a new Invisalign set. My old Invisalign needed to be cleaned. I read the reviews and decided to purchase. OMG, it worked! They had a fresh taste and were clean. I wish I had found this product sooner. I did let them soak overnight only because I had been wearing them for the last four months. Nothing happened to Invisalign; there was no weakness or anything. Just very clean and fresh. If I could have given the product 10 stars, I would have. \" \u2014 Lisa R. Get 120 tablets from Amazon for $18.81 (available in five pack sizes). 3.

Even after using cotton buds to clean the AirPods out, I thought that was enough until my friend said there's stuff built up and hard to see, but there was nothing able to get it out! Enter this product. It literally took five minutes to clean each ear bud effectively and instantly the sound quality was as good as new! Loud, clear, less trouble connecting to my phone, etc. You don't need a full square to clean them, so you can pull a piece off or reuse a square with a side you haven't used!

Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord has to say: \"I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.\" Promising review: \"I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth \u2014 it definitely gets between the teeth and also, more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck, and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!\" \u2014 Jason A. Get a pair from Amazon for $9.99 . 7.

I spray on shovels to keep dirt or snow from sticking, spray around windows and thresholds to deter bugs, clean Sharpies off wood and walls, and, of course, stop squeaky doors.

I absolutely hate taking the shower curtains off because of the whole open and close for several shower curtains. I know you\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s just shower curtain hooks.\u2019 And it is. But when you have to change out the creepy shower liner that likes to attack you, and you dread doing so, this just adds seconds to your life. No more unsnapping. Simply take out the liner, place the liner on the appropriate hook, and presto.\" \u2014 Nardsbaby Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in 18 colors). 10.

I have tried muscle relaxers, stretching, and many other things, but a couple of muscles in my upper back would just knot up with any stress, physical or emotional, and the pain was nearly constant. I used this for about a half hour on all of my muscles with the first use, and the effects were immediate and profound. Pain relief was instant , and occasional use for a couple of minutes to the affected areas has been able to maintain that relief. I loved it so much that I bought one for my brother, who says it is helping him tremendously, as well. I have charged my massager twice in the last two months, battery life is excellent!\" \u2014 Patty S. Get it from Amazon for $89.99 (available in seven colors). 11. A Squatty Potty that elevates your feet to help mimic a natural squatting position for easier, more complete bowel movements. Just because it helps your trips to the bathroom be quicker doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still enjoy some quality TikTok scrolling time while you\u2019re in there! Amazon, www.amazon.com I have one and it has truly made that aspect of life (\ud83d\udebd) soooo much easier!

Pan is dropped, and greasy meat juice is all over our patio brick. In freezing temps. I use a putty knife to get some out, but there the stain remains six months later. Even muriatic acid didn\u2019t cut it. Ordered this. Tried a spot. Let it dry overnight. Swept it. Stain is almost gone. I apply it to the rest of the stain and let it set. But this time it rains and turns it gooey. Fortunately, new power washer and I join forces with Chomp, and within a half hour, it\u2019s totally gone. Amazing product. 1,000% satisfied. \" \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (available in two sizes). 17.

Does your partner point to the dishwasher and ask you, 'Hey, are these good?' Mine did, almost daily. Not anymore, though! A breeze to install (our dishwasher is magnetic, but I'm really glad it came with adhesive pads \u2014 someday when we move, if we need them we have them!), and even though I bought it (mostly) as a joke, I use the heck out of it. Slides easily when it needs to.\" \u2014 Andrea Braun Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in six styles). 19.

Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed See the ChomChom roller in action on TikTok ! BuzzFeed Shopping editor Jenae Sitzes swears by this: \"The tens of thousands of 5-star Amazon reviews are reason enough to add the ChomChom to your cart immediately \u2014 but let me add my own personal review to the stack. I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, and I took the photos above to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller \u2014 at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair. It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside , which does require you to apply a bit of pressure. Afterward, you'll just dump out the hair that's been trapped inside. The ChomChom is best for large flat surfaces like couches and beds.\" Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in three colors). 20.

This product does everything and more. Just ordered another round. We were about to throw away some furniture due to the smell and now after use we can keep it. Saved me hundreds. Well worth the money. \" \u2014 clayton s tonkin Get it from Amazon for $17.96 (available in two sizes and packs of two or three). 21. A standing weeder that uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. It has a bamboo handle and four steel claws to really dig into those roots and pull them OUT.

Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 22.

And while you're at it, some dishwasher tablets that break down lime and mineral buildup to properly clean your dishwasher (you know, the machine that cleans your dishes ) without *any* effort on your part. Just pop in a tablet and run the dishwasher as normal \u2014 it sure beats having to climb in there yourself and scrub. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and dishes just not getting clean. Then, I became aware that the water softener was no longer doing its job so I had the rental company replace it. Dishwasher performance improved somewhat. I decided to do two more loads before deciding to purchase a new one. Then I saw a product test review for Affresh. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway so I added that to my order. When it came, I tossed one of the tablets into the bottom of the full machine per the instructions and ran the regular cycle. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I will use this faithfully every month, as recommended. \" \u2014 Sheila Get a pack of six tablets from Amazon for $7.49 . 24.

Been using them since high school! The amount of junk and buildup that comes off is so satisfying to see! It can be irritating when removing, especially if you have sensitive skin.

I tried this product on a whim\u2026and boy am I glad!! I wash, rinse and dry in the morning and they are dry and ready for use by lunch if I need a touch up. It does take a few minutes but SO WORTH it!! They more I use it, the faster I am getting. My brushes look new after and feel so much better on my skin. My makeup even goes on nicer.

Definitely a great buy at an extremely affordable price. The quality exceeded my expectations. It is so soft, true to size and color, wrinkle-free, and has a well-made zipper at the bottom. There are also ties on the inside to keep your duvet in place. I absolutely LOVE everything about this cover. Can\u2019t wait to get home in my bed after a long, exhausting work shift on my feet. My furbaby loves it too! Thanks Amazon for simplifying my life! \u2764\ufe0f\" \u2014 Theresa Get a set from Amazon for $24.99+ (available in sizes twin\u2013oversized king and in 30 colors). 29.

Now all your books can look like they've been perpetually Wingardium Leviosa-ed! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These are so much fun! We ordered the small size, which fits standard hardback books (approximately 5\u20137 hardbacks in my experience). They're a great way to add some extra storage to our very small home, and we've placed them in our hallway so people ask us about them all the time. I'd highly recommend!\" \u2014 LaBuenaVidaMere Get a set of three from Amazon for $23.65 (available in two sizes). 31.

Just attach the clips to both straps in the back, and voila! \u2014 no one can see your bra straps from the front. Amazon Promising review: \"My bra straps spent more time off my shoulders than on them. I have bras that fit perfectly, but the straps are too wide-set or something. I'm so glad I bought these little bra strap clip holders because they've solved the problem. I've used them for three days now, and my straps have not fallen off of my shoulders even once in that time. Amazing! I love them! I put a clip holder on my bra and then put the bra on like a T-shirt \u2014 over my head, put my arms in, then fasten it as usual in the back \u2014 pretty easy. The length of the clip holders are adjustable. I have fully extended them to fit across the back of my 38DD bras. At first it felt a bit odd because it was different, but it doesn't take long to adjust to the feel of it. The strap clip holders do the job, and they are pretty cheap, so give them a try. \" \u2014 Polly Esther Get a set of three from Amazon for $5.97+ (available in eight sets with different colors). 32.

So. Much. Room. There is so much room left in my drawer now that I moved stuff from another drawer and I have an entirely empty drawer in my kitchen now.

Promising review: \"My skin is 100% softer and feels far smoother thanks to this product!!! The difference was noticeable after ONE use, its true. All the grime, rolled up skin, flakes and chucks \u2014 shudder, that was on me??? Everything other customers are saying about how disgusting it is when you see how much dead skin sloughs off is true. I disagree that it only comes off after the first use though \u2014 I have continued to see improvement over the time I've used it, about six weeks, and even some age-related and sun damage discoloration is gone.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

EPCOT The HOKA Bondi 8s are undeniably comfy \u2014 we\u2019re talking marshmallow soles, maximum cushion, all the foot-hugging support you could want. But the truth is that we don\u2019t always wear them in Disney World\u2026 and yeah, we\u2019ve got our reasons. DISCLOSURE: This post may contain affiliate links, which means when you click a link and make a purchase, we receive a commission. First, let\u2019s give credit where it\u2019s due: HOKA Bondi 8s are built for comfort. If you\u2019ve ever worn them, you know that soft landing and pillowy feel underfoot. \u00a9Amazon It\u2019s like walking on memory foam. They\u2019ve got great arch support, a wider base for stability, and that oversized midsole is a lifesaver on long walking days. We totally get why so many people swear by them. In fact, most of our AllEars team lives in their HOKAs when they\u2019re in the parks. Grab them here But here\u2019s the painfully honest truth: they\u2019re chunky. Like, really chunky. And while that\u2019s part of the design (and part of what makes them so comfortable), we can\u2019t help but feel a little\u2026 clunky in them. It\u2019s not a dealbreaker, but when you\u2019re already sweating through your tank top and trying to get a cute castle photo? Yeah, it matters. \u00a9Amazon We own the Bondi 8s and do wear them \u2014 just not all the time. Especially not when we\u2019re trying to put together a cuter park look. We know, we know, style shouldn\u2019t come before comfort when it comes to Disney shoes, but sometimes we reach for other shoes instead. They\u2019re sleeker, they pair better with our outfits, and even if they don\u2019t treat our feet quite as nicely by hour eight\u2026 we do it anyway. We suffer a little for the \u2018fit. And we\u2019re not proud of it, but we\u2019re being honest here. So let\u2019s weigh the pros and cons: HOKA Bondi 8 Pros: Extreme comfort and support \u2014 seriously, A+ Great for people who need extra cushioning or have foot pain Durable and reliable even after long days in the parks Fit for actual running (or chasing Lightning Lanes) HOKA Bondi 8 Cons: Bulky, heavy look that doesn\u2019t always go with every outfit Can feel a little stiff at first and take up a lot of space in your suitcase Expensive \u2014 if you\u2019re only wearing them for Disney, they\u2019re an investment Let\u2019s talk about the alternative sneakers we\u2019re reaching for: First, we\u2019ve got these New Balance Men\u2019s/Women\u2019s Oxford Sneakers : \u00a9Amazon They\u2019re still cushy but way more streamlined. Plus, they have a fun retro vibe that works with most of my park outfits. Grab them here Next up, we\u2019ve got these Brooks Women\u2019s Adrenaline GTS 23 Supportive Running Shoes : \u00a9Amazon These are solid running shoes with real support. They\u2019re not quite as chunky as the HOKAS but still have that plush, reliable feel. If you want all-day comfort in a slightly more streamlined silhouette, this is a great option. Grab them here Lastly, we\u2019ve got these adidas Women\u2019s Cloudfoam Pure Sportswear Sneakers : \u00a9Amazon If your Disney style leans sporty-chic, these are a great pick. The foam is soft, the fit is flexible, and the design is cute enough to blend with pretty much any park outfit. Grab them here At the end of the day, wear what works for you. If you\u2019re prioritizing function over fashion, HOKAs are probably your best bet. And if you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019s fully committed to comfort (you should be!), don\u2019t let the look stop you. \u00a9Amazon But if you\u2019re like us \u2014 balancing comfort with aesthetics, especially when you\u2019ve planned a whole Disney look \u2014 we totally get reaching for a sleeker sneaker even if you know your feet will hate you by dinnertime. And yes, we know this is a hot take. But someone had to say it. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for the best Disney essentials, so make sure you stay tuned to AllEars for more!

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I write about lifestyle tech Follow Author Apr 12, 2025, 12:45pm EDT Share Save Comment Updated April 12 with more details of offers and deals. Amazon has new price cuts for iPhones which take select models right back to their Spring Sale lows. The discounts apply to the the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, and the iPhone 16 Pro versions, too. In fact, all the phones in the iPhone 16 series are represented apart from the newest of all, the iPhone 16e, which is the most affordable of the range. What\u2019s more, there are bargains to be had if you\u2019d like the iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Plus, as well. Apple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus prices are down at Amazon. Getty Images Amazon U.K. has discounted the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max by \u00a3100 or more. The deals highlighted in this post were independently selected by the Contributor and do not contain affiliate links. Forbes Apple Intelligence For iPhone To Add Google Gemini In Weeks, Report Claims By David Phelan Let\u2019s start with the iPhone 16. The entry-level model has 128GB storage and comes in four colors, of which three are discounted in this storage level. Choose between pink, teal and white to find the iPhone with 13% off. That takes the price down by \u00a3101, from \u00a3799 ($1,019) to \u00a3698 ($890). Here\u2019s the link for the iPhone 16. MORE FOR YOU Microsoft\u2019s Free Upgrade Offer For 500 Million Windows Users \u2018Worse Than 1971\u2019\u2014U.S. Dollar Price \u2018Collapse\u2019 Predicted To Ignite $22 Trillion Bitcoin Challenge To Gold Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Saturday, April 12th If you\u2019re mad about the Ultramarine color, and I couldn\u2019t blame you, there are savings available if you choose the 512GB version. The regular price for this is \u00a31,099 ($1,402) but it has a 9% discount, which also works out at \u00a3101 off, making it \u00a3998 ($1,273). The same price applies for the pink, teal and white finishes. The fifth color, black, is not worth having at the current Amazon price of \u00a31,202.79 for the 128GB storage model. The iPhone 16 with 256GB storage is also not available. Fancy a bigger screen? The iPhone 16 Plus is discounted by 11%, taking its regular \u00a3899 ($1,147) sticker down by \u00a3101 (spotting a pattern here?) to \u00a3798 ($1,018). You only get to choose the white finish at this price, please note. Here\u2019s the iPhone 16 Plus link . There\u2019s more choice for the 256GB storage option, a 10% discount of \u00a3101 brings the \u00a3999 ($1,275) price down to \u00a3898 ($1,146). All colors except black available. The full range of colors is discounted on the largest storage of 512GB. Down from \u00a31,199 ($1,530) by 8% or, you guessed it, \u00a3101, the new price is \u00a31,098 ($1,401) and you can choose between black, pink, teal, ultramarine and white. If you can\u2019t resist the three cameras and titanium frame of the iPhone 16 Pro, these are discounted, too. Here\u2019s the link. All four colors are available for the 128GB storage models. That means Desert Titanium, Black Titanium, Natural Titanium and White Titanium are all 10% off, that means the regular \u00a3999 ($1,308) price is knocked down by \u00a3100 ($131) to \u00a3899 ($1,178). And you\u2019ll notice the magic spell of \u00a3101 off has been broken on this model, though only just. Forbes Apple\u2019s Stealthy New Music Upgrade For Windows PCs Beats Microsoft By David Phelan Same for the 256GB model, which also sees \u00a3100 ($131) off, across the board. Here it\u2019s a 9% discount, taking the \u00a31,099 ($1,439) sticker down to \u00a3999 ($1,308). All four colors available. Step up to 512GB storage and something eerily predictable happens: all four colors available with \u00a3100 ($131) off. This means an 8% price cut, so the regular \u00a31,299 ($1,701) price drops to \u00a31,199 ($1,570). The same \u00a3100 ($131) cut means the regular \u00a31,499 ($1,963) price for the 1TB storage option is \u00a31,399 ($1,832). The biggest phone of all is the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a 6.9-inch display. Check this link and you\u2019ll see a wholly unsurprising discount in place. That\u2019s right, there\u2019s \u00a3100 ($131) off the 256GB model \u2014 the lowest-capacity storage option for the Max \u2014 which reduces the price from \u00a31,199 ($1,570) to \u00a31,099 ($1,439), with all colors ready to ship. The 512GB version also (can you believe it?) shows a \u00a3100 ($131) price cut. That\u2019s a 7% discount and brings the regular \u00a31,399 ($1,832) sticker to \u00a31,299 ($1,701. All colors available. The 1TB option, regularly \u00a31,599 ($2,094) down by \u00a3100 ($131), as you may have guessed. This 6% price cut means you\u2019ll pay \u00a31,499 ($1,963). Lastly, there\u2019s the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. Last year\u2019s standard iPhones may not have all the love expended on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, which arguably took the regular phones closer to the Pro models than before, but they\u2019re still worth considering, especially when the prices are reduced as here. Apple will sell you the iPhone 15 with 128GB storage for \u00a3699. On Amazon ( here\u2019s the link ), all five colors are available for \u00a3598. That\u2019s 14% off and our old friend the $101 discount reappears. The five colors, by the way, are yellow, green, pink, blue and black. Trade up to 256GB and instead of the regular \u00a3799 price you can find all five for \u00a3698. The larger-display iPhone 15 Plus, usually selling for \u00a3799 with 128GB storage, has dropped to \u00a3698, that\u2019s 13% off but only in green and pink. The 256GB storage has dropped from \u00a3899 to, yes, that\u2019s right, \u00a3798, which is an 11% discount. You can choose between blue and black for this deal. The 512GB storage option is available for this larger phone, wih the same \u00a3101 discount, taking the price from \u00a31,099 to \u00a3998. Choose between black and, no, that\u2019s it, just black. Incidentally, if U.S. readers see the price translations and feel the Brits are paying well over the odds compared to prices in the States, remember that U.S. prices are quoted pre-tax and U.K. ones have all sales taxes included, so the disparity isn\u2019t as steep as it looks. And if price rises cut in Stateside because of tariffs, then iPhones could even be cheaper on the other side of the pond one day.

A colorful wireless keyboard and mouse set for adding some joy-inducing color to your workspace without any bothersome cords to tie you down. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com The set includes a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse with a USB receiver. Pick up some AA batteries \u2014 both will need them! Promising review: \"Every time I walk into my red office and see this beautiful keyboard, it makes me happy. It looks just like it does in the photo. It's such a jolt of color, and with its cool circular retro buttons, it's just a pleasure to use. If you need a pick-me-up (and who doesn't this year?), I can't recommend this highly enough.\" \u2014 CA-girl Get it from Amazon for $40.99 (available in 14 styles). 2. An aesthetic flexible power strip so you can actually utilize each and every outlet even when your excessively massive laptop charger is present. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com iJoy is a small business selling a variety of tech accessories, speakers, and headphones. Promising review: \"I rarely write a review (this is the second in the past few years). One of the best purchases in a long time. Nice design and very practical. It solves all of my problems as it can go any direction. It's worth every penny. I turned around and bought two more. I am about to buy my fourth one. Love this!\" \u2014 Pond P. Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in three colors). 3. A ventilated cable management box if you're tired of tangled cords trapping your feet and offending your eyes. Amazon Promising review: \" A must-buy product for your messy home or office. Exactly what I was looking for to help save space and hide my cable cords.\" \u2014 Andrew Olson Get it from Amazon for $15.99 . 4. An ergonomic nonslip mouse pad because it's the wrist-aligning support system you need to fire off hot takes on Slack with minimal pain and discomfort. www.amazon.com Read more about how an ergonomic mouse can help prevent carpal tunnel at Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: \"The design is gorgeous and so comfy that I even take it when I travel for business. This has relieved wrist pain from working on the computer every day.\" \u2014 Bianka P Gonzalez G Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in 21 patterns). 5. A 52-sheet to-do list pad for when you're overwhelmed with all the things that need doing and just don't know where to start. Blank legal pads do not inspire, but this cutie sure does! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I LOVE this product! I live off lists every day at work, and this keeps me super organized! I have my daily list, top three priorities, things I need to remember for the next day, and miscellaneous notes all on the same page!\" \u2014 Ldsappy Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in six colors/styles). 6. A USB-powered LED light strip to give your desk area a futuristic glow while working double-duty to reduce eye fatigue and hopefully keep those pesky headaches at bay when you're pulling extra long shifts. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have procrastinated in writing this review and am actually happy to say that after a year, the product is continuing to stay strong. The adhesion is as strong as it was on day one, and this product continues to meet and exceed expectations. I have noticed significantly less eye strain. If I were needing computer monitor backlighting again, I wouldn't hesitate to repurchase. \" \u2014 college_engineer Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in two sizes). 7. A cooling memory foam seat cushion that's unassuming enough to blend in with most any desk chair and will make you feel ~supported~ even on your longest days. www.amazon.com The velour cover zips off for easy cleaning in the washing machine. Promising review: \"I've purchased similar items in the past that visually looked like this but were stiff and rigid. This is amazing. Totally eased my back pain from my quarantine-at-home desk job . Highly recommend.\" \u2014 Bellarosa555 Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in seven colors). 8. Or a whimsical paw chair cushion so you can add an extra layer of comfort *and* cuteness to cradle your booty while you're on the clock. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Got this for my office desk. It definitely stands out, and the older ladies at my work love it! It works well as a seat cushion, as my office chair is so thin I can feel the metal and plastic bits when sitting. With the cushion, it's super soft and comfortable!\" \u2014 Jane Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in two sizes and six colors). 9. An electric mug warmer because nothing ruins your cozy desk vibes quite like reaching for your coffee only to find it's gone cold. With this chic little warmer, you can join the slow sippers club without having to make a bazillion trips to the microwave. If this seems like one big fire hazard to you \u2014 fear not \u2014 there's a built-in auto shutoff! Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Reviewers suggest turning the heat down from high to medium once the drink gets down to about the halfway point so it stays a comfortable temperature! Check it out on TikTok (where one reviewer even has the genius idea to use it as a candle warmer at their desk, too)! BuzzFeed editor Jenae Sitzes wishes she had bought it sooner: \"After seeing this coffee warmer all over BuzzFeed Shopping and even gifting my dad one for Christmas, I finally decided to buy one for myself. Based on all the reviews, I was pretty confident I'd soon be kicking myself for not getting it sooner, and that proved to be true: This thing not only looks good but works great for keeping my coffee warm all day long. (Because yes, I'm one of those people who'll sip on coffee until 5 p.m., all right!!) I was kind of worried it'd be too small for some of my larger mugs, but the center plate is bigger than expected and accommodated every mug in my (very eclectic) collection perfectly. I can confirm that flat-bottomed mugs are the best option for this warmer as they do stay hotter, but it still keeps my concave-bottom mugs warm enough for my taste. Also, I looove how sleek the white version looks on my white desk, and the auto-shutoff function is a nice safety feature for an absent-minded person.\" Get it from Amazon for $21.99+ (available in nine styles). 10. A slim desktop whiteboard if your desk is littered with distracting sticky notes that always seem to get lost anyway. This memo board is designed to fit comfortably between a keyboard and a monitor, creating a designated place where you can write out all your absolutely-cannot-forget reminders again and again and again. www.amazon.com The whiteboard also comes with a dry-erase marker, an accessory channel (to hold the marker), and a storage drawer. Promising review: \"Never thought something analog would be SO useful in my daily routine. I work from home and am constantly project managing a number of complex strategic projects. Having pertinent information directly in front of me and top of mind has done incredible things for my productivity . Never would have imagined it would make such a difference. For a nominal investment, I highly recommend it if you have trouble keeping up with things.\" \u2014 Captainflapjax Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in four styles). 11. Or a wall-mounted acrylic dry-erase board for a major aesthetic upgrade to standard dry erase boards with all the same schedule-tracking, note-taking, and organizing prowess. 1801 & Co. / Etsy 1801 & Co. is a Minnesota-based Etsy shop established in 2016 that specializes in family wall calendars, chore charts, wedding signs, and more. Promising review : \"I love it! I got it so fast after ordering, and it\u2019s perfect . I love the sleek design for my small home office space. I can\u2019t function at work without a dry erase board but couldn\u2019t find any that would look nice in my office space, which is in the corner of my master bedroom! Having functional office space without LOOKING like an office in the bedroom is challenging, but this acrylic board is PERFECT. The black pen that comes with it is very nice fine tip and erases without a trace.\" \u2014 Dawn Powell Get it from 1801 & Co. on Etsy for $32.73+ (available in 19 sizes and three hardware styles/finishes). 12. A jumbo printed desk pad to cover up all those stains, chips, and scratches (How'd those even get there?) with any one of a vast collection of colors and patterns to suit any taste. Plus, you'll LOVE all the free-range mouse movin' you can do with all this newfound space. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I really like this mat \u2014 I've had it for several months now, and it hasn't faded or scuffed at all. Makes my basic office cubicle desk a little prettier and does the job I really needed it for \u2014 to soften the surface of my desk because I hate the way my mouse sounds without a mousepad. Several coworkers have complimented the design and asked for the link! \" \u2014 AliB_Art Get it from Amazon for $18.99 (available in 24 colors/prints). 13. Super pretty rainbow prism sun catchers so you can bask in sunny rainbows even if you're stuck inside working. Who can't help but smile at a rainbow?! www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I put two of these in my home office window, where the sun shines in the morning. Every morning, it's an explosion of cheerful rainbows and sunshine, and it just makes me happy to be alive! The quality is excellent. Even though they aren't crystal, I honestly don't think you would ever see a difference if they were, other than being a few hundred dollars poorer. They are heavy, remarkably clear, smooth, crisp facets, and appear flawless.\" \u2014 Dr Hall Get a set of two from Amazon for $9.98 . 14. A capybara desk companion that'll just about force a smile out of you whenever it catches your eye, even when Jake from IT is getting on your last nerve.

A precious little mushroom lamp if you're short on space but big on your love for all things cottagecore. This lovely little mush casts a soft glow across your desk, with 16 colors and four brightness levels easily controlled with a remote. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review : \"Cute, cute, cute! This is one of the cutest night-lights ever! Not only does it change colors, but it can also be controlled remotely and changed in a variety of colors and effects, from flashing to slowly fading from one color into another, or if desired, one constant color to match any decor. The brightness can also be adjusted. And the wood base gives it more than the look of a toy; it is perfectly classy.\" \u2014 roika Get it from Amazon for $22.99 . 16. A space-efficient bamboo multi-device charging dock for corralling the sprawling mess of tech and chargers into one designated display that practically doubles as decor. www.amazon.com Great Useful Stuff is a Utah-based small business selling a tight selection of home and lifestyle goods that embody the brand's name. Promising review: \"My desk was full of chargers and cords. This really helps keep everything organized and puts those cords out of sight. I also use the dividers to store a notebook, so you can use it for other things besides computers, phones, etc. I also really like the material. I got the light bamboo.\" \u2014 Stephanie Get it from Amazon for $48 (available in four other styles). 17. A tufted height-adjustable swivel chair to bring a warm sense of cozy into your WFH cubicle that almost looks too good to be considered so comfortable by so many reviewers. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This is great. The chair is perfect. I bought this as my desk chair and it\u2019s awesome. The set up is very easy and quick. It\u2019s also very comfortable. It looks exactly as pictured.

This little guy has a majorly big mouth that's perfect for stashing sweets, keys, or anything else that might need a fearsome protector. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Honestly better than I thought it would be. It looked cool online, and I bought it as an impulse buy and was not disappointed. It's heavy and well-made. If I had any complaint, it's that due to the shape of the jaw, some jelly beans fall out if I don't grab them carefully, but I've decided that's a small price to pay for this epic protector sitting on my desk.\" \u2014 David Get it from Amazon for $44.98+ (available in three colors). 25.
