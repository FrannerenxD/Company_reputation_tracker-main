Blue Origin has two rockets and is developing a moon lander and multifunctional spacecraft. Here's the rocket company's history, mission, customers, and biggest rocket launches. Blue Origin's rockets are making a name for themselves in the private space race. Jeff Bezos founded the aerospace company in 2000 with the idea of moving heavy, polluting industries off our planet and into space, where millions of people would live and work. The company's name, Blue Origin, refers to Earth. Bezos called Blue Origin his \"most important work,\" in a 2018 interview with Axel Springer . Blue Origin's mission is to \"build a road to space\" by developing reliable, cost-effective rockets. Blue Origin is vying for space industry dominance as spaceflight companies aim for the moon and Mars. The company's New Shepard rockets regularly fly tourists on short flights to the edge of space. Its New Glenn rocket is designed to carry heavy missions into orbit or to the moon. Blue Origin engineers are also developing a moon lander, called Blue Moon, for future NASA use. Blue Origin's ambitions have been a source of rivalry between Bezos and Elon Musk , whose company SpaceX remains the world's leading rocket-launch provider. History and founding Bezos has said he founded Blue Origin with the vision of giant space stations hosting entire mega-cities of people, based on concepts proposed by the physicist Gerard K. O'Neill in 1976. Bezos told Lex Fridman in 2023 that he wants to support one trillion humans living throughout the solar system. He added that would result in 1,000 Mozarts and 1,000 Einsteins at any given time. \"We could easily support a civilization that large with all the resources in the solar system,\" he added. Still, Bezos says in a video on Blue Origin's website that \"Earth is the best planet.\" Blue Origin did not initially seem to improve Jeff Bezos' net worth , though. Bezos later revealed, in 2017, that he was selling Amazon stock to finance the rocket company. The company kept a very low profile for its first two decades. Blue Origin's first rocket launch was in 2015. That was an uncrewed test flight of the suborbital New Shepard rocket. Bezos himself flew on New Shepard's first passenger flight in July 2021, making history as the first billionaire to reach the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which is a somewhat arbitrary but internationally recognized boundary at 100 kilometers (62 miles) altitude. It's sometimes referred to as the beginning of outer space. Bezos stepped down as Amazon CEO that same year, saying he wanted to focus on Blue Origin. In May 2023, Blue Origin won a NASA contract to land astronauts on the moon, after suing the agency for awarding its first moon-landing contract to only SpaceX . The company lost the lawsuit. Blue Origin's super-sized orbital rocket, New Glenn , launched for the first time in January 2025. In April 2025, the company clinched its first Pentagon launch contracts. Blue Origin's CEO is Dave Limp. The company is headquartered in Kent, Washington, and has rocket launch facilities in West Texas. It has also used a launchpad at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Blue Origin rockets Blue Origin has one suborbital rocket and one orbital rocket. It's also developing a moon lander and a moon-orbiting spacecraft.

Blue Origin's New Glenn heavy-lift rocket prepares for launch. Blue Origin New Glenn is named after the first American to reach orbit, John Glenn . Seven BE-4 engines on the booster give it enough power to carry up to 45 metric tons into space. New Glenn belongs to a new generation of the largest, most powerful rockets ever built, next to SpaceX's Starship and NASA's new moon rocket, the Space Launch System. Blue Origin had begun developing an orbital launch system by 2013, and New Glenn finally made its inaugural flight in January 2025. New Glenn's first launch was a major leap forward for Blue Origin. It was the first time a rocket company successfully reached orbit on its first-ever attempt. Here's how the rocket's launch works: As New Glenn screams through the skies, the booster does most of the heavy lifting. Once its fuel is spent and the rocket is on a strong trajectory toward space, the booster separates from the rocket's second stage, which continues onward using BE-3U engines. Blue Origin aims to land the booster on a platform in the ocean, but on New Glenn's first flight, the booster was lost as it fell back to Earth. Eventually, the company wants to reuse boosters up to 25 times. According to Blue Origin, the company is already working with customers for New Glenn missions, including AST SpaceMobile, telecommunications companies, and the US Space Force. New Shepard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket is designed for suborbital flights which skim the edge of space. It has been flying tourist crews of up to six passengers since 2021. Blue Origin's New Shepard suborbital rocket launches. Blue Origin Bezos himself flew on New Shepard's first flight, then took the Star Trek actor William Shatner on the rocket's second flight later that year. Upon landing, Shatner said seeing the blackness of space was like looking at death, and added, \"I hope I never recover from this.\" Jeff Bezos pinned astronaut wings on William Shatner after their flight together aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket. Blue Origin Blue Origin plans to fly its first all-female passenger crew aboard New Shepard on April 14, including Gayle King, Katy Perry, and Bezos's fianc\u00e9e, Lauren S\u00e1nchez . Flights on New Shepard last about 11 minutes. Passengers get about three minutes of microgravity, where they can unbuckle from their seats, drift around the spaceship's cabin, and peer out the windows at Earth, before strapping back in for the plummet home. Because it doesn't need to push itself all the way into orbit, New Shepard is a tiny rocket at just 61 feet tall. BE-3PM engines launch the rocket, then re-fire to softly land it back on the ground. New Shepard is completely reusable. New Shepard's development involved nine years of testing, which included 16 test flights and three tests of the capsule's emergency escape system. The vehicle is named after astronaut Alan Shepard, who was the first American to travel to space. Unlike Glenn's orbital flight, Shepard's flight was suborbital. Blue Moon Blue Origin is developing the Blue Moon vehicle to land missions on the surface of the moon, launched by the New Glenn rocket. An artist's rendering of Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander. Blue Origin The company is developing variations of the spacecraft for cargo \u2014 up to three metric tons of it \u2014 and human crews. Blue Origin is building BE-7 engines for the lander. The engines are designed to operate in the vacuum of space with enough power to land heavy missions on the moon. Blue Origin is developing the lander under a $3.4 billion NASA contract. The contract calls for Blue Origin to conduct an uncrewed test mission to the lunar surface before carrying two astronauts there in 2029. For NASA astronaut missions, Blue Moon must be able to dock to the Lunar Gateway space station the agency is planning to build in lunar orbit. Blue Ring In 2023 Blue Origin announced it was working on a highly maneuverable spacecraft called Blue Ring. The company plans to sell Blue Ring missions to other companies, which can put more than 3,000 kilograms (about 6,600 pounds) of hardware on board. Blue Origin says the vehicle can enter a variety of orbits between Earth and the moon. \"Blue Ring addresses two of the most difficult challenges in spaceflight today: growing space infrastructure and increasing mobility on-orbit,\" Paul Ebertz, the senior vice president of Blue Origin's in-space systems, said in a statement. The first New Glenn launch carried a prototype of Blue Ring. Blue Origin vs. SpaceX Blue Origin and SpaceX have competed for NASA contracts and clout. SpaceX frequently wins the competition. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are competing in the commercial space race. Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC; Eugene Gologursky/Getty Images for The New York Times SpaceX was founded two years later than Blue Origin, but it was launching rockets to orbit by 2008. Its highly influential orbital Falcon 9 rocket first began flying in 2010. Blue Origin didn't launch its first orbital rocket until 2025. Some of Bezos' space projects mirror Musk's. For example, like SpaceX's Starship, Blue Origin's New Glenn is designed to be a reusable super-heavy-lift mega-rocket. While SpaceX launches thousands of Starlink internet satellites into orbit, Bezos's counterpart \u2014 Amazon's Kuiper satellites \u2014 have been building to their first launch. At the New York Times DealBook Summit in December 2024, Bezos said that Blue Origin \"is not a very good business, yet.\" Still, he added, \"It's going to be the best business that I've ever been involved in.\" Recommended video Blue Origin Jeff Bezos Read next Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know HOME Subscribe This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers.

I read a short story when I was a teenager that unsettles me to this day. It featured an everyday American town, only everyone there was beholden to this one particular kid. Even the adults would watch what they said and did around him. To spoil the twist, it turned out the kid was born with godlike powers. The town, and the chunk of the planet it sat on, was adrift in space somewhere after he\u2019d dislocated it from the planet. The lives of the survivors living in this bubble now revolved around the child, although they tried desperately to pretend that life was normal. Obviously the worst of it was their deity was a three-year old child, not a wise all-seeing superpower. The kid-god was insecure, arbitrary, unpredictable, spiteful, prone to deadly tantrums, and generally mentally ill-equipped for the job. I\u2019m sure you can see where I\u2019m going with this. Trump TV Look at a chart of the S&P 500 this week and you\u2019ll find that US shares closed much higher. Perhaps some Panglossian observers see a good week for the markets, like the town folk in that story pretended they were living a good life . Passive purists will see more evidence to ignore the noise and keep buying . But experienced, the week was a rollercoaster ride driven by the kind of crazy plot lines and reversals you\u2019d expect to find \u2013 not coincidentally \u2013 in a season of WWE Wrestling . We\u2019re all degenerate meme traders now I won\u2019t run through the ups and downs. If you care about market drama, you saw them unfold. Ditto Trump\u2019s tariffs. If you haven\u2019t read enough of the millions of words written by now to convince you of their sheer stupidity, this post won\u2019t tip the balance. But for two weeks the market has given us real-time pricing on just how damaging this plank of Trump\u2019s agenda would be. The Nasdaq and very nearly the S&P 500 plunged into a bear market, before rallying on Trump declaring a 90-day pause for most of them. Below is a daily price chart of that reaction. Remember these are multi-trillion cap indices \u2013 not illiquid meme coins \u2013 rising as much as 12% in a day: What a killer run for Trump TV , watched around the world! Personally I found it even more exciting than the one where his supporters invaded the US capital a few seasons ago. It\u2019s much more thrilling when you\u2019ve skin in the game. And the subplots! The pseudonymous \u2018Walter Bloomberg\u2019 X account that promoted the \u2018fake\u2019 story the tariffs would be paused for 90-days, whipsawing markets by $2.5 trillion in half an hour as it was believed and then denied! The arch-villain China slapping back with even more tariffs of its own! Then Trump apparently being inspired by Walter\u2019s fake \u2018pause\u2019 and actually implementing a 90-day delay. Possibly only after he watched a bank boss fretting on Fox TV! This isn\u2019t even to get into how these enormously consequential announcements are being made via Trump\u2019s Truth Social account. Rather than, you know, the White House. Or even accusations for potential nation-scale insider trading based on Trump telling his supporters it was a good time to buy stocks, shortly before the market ripped 10% on his latest not-Tweet. Personally, I don\u2019t think it can be insider trading when it\u2019s done in public. But also, what a quaint thing to worry about these days\u2026 Do you even lift, bro? Perhaps my favourite bit involved all the NPCs / billionaire tech and finance bros battling on social media. Especially Trump supporter and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who went from warning the tariffs would cause an \u2018economic nuclear winter\u2019 one day, to praising Trump for a textbook \u2018art of the deal\u2019 later. I\u2019m with AQR founder Cliff Asness who replied that: \u201cFor me, one of the main benefits of making some money is not having to wear a gimp suit for anybody.\u201d But I suppose Ackman is in too deep to recant. Black Mirror Monday At the risk of sounding exactly like someone who complains that WWE Wrestling is not a real sport \u2013 and thus who piously reveals that they don\u2019t get the joke \u2013 it\u2019s a bit sickening to me that this entire charade has become normalised in just a few short months. Well I\u2019m having none of it. This is not normal, and it\u2019s not a brilliant way to shape US economic policy, let alone re-route the world. It\u2019s mindlessly stupid. The tariffs would plunge us into a depression if implemented, whereas they only have us flirting with recession when teased and (partly) retracted. Listen, if the US wants to turn itself into an autarky run by an autocrat, go for it. I don\u2019t believe the US public voted for that \u2013 and it would impoverish most people there, especially the poor \u2013 but that\u2019s its (bad) business. But let\u2019s not pretend the case for free trade wasn\u2019t made 200 years ago. And not just in theory \u2013 the world, and especially the US, has mostly grown crazy rich on the benefits. You might as well declare you\u2019ve doubts about the theory of steam engines. Then again, 10% of the US electorate believes the Earth is flat, so perhaps they would. In most cases for most countries at most times tariffs are bad. Trump\u2019s sky-high tariffs for the US are idiotic, and even as a threat they will have consequences. No serious CEO will have begun to move factories to the US last weekend based on Trump\u2019s earnest declarations that tariffs were \u2018beautiful\u2019 and here to stay and set to reinvigorate US manufacturing and all the rest. Yet the unfolding farce will still be affecting millions of decisions up and down the supply chain. To give one tiny example, the UK\u2019s Character Group \u2013 the maker of Peppa Pig plushies \u2013 withdrew market guidance this week. As This Is Money reports: Character, which manufactures Teletubbies toys and the largest range of Peppa Pig products, told investors on Friday its \u2018ability to assess the financial implications\u2019 of tariffs has been \u2018considerably obscured\u2019 by escalating retaliatory measures. The New Malden-based group predominantly counts the UK and Scandinavia as its key markets, but US sales made up about 20% of turnover last year. The UK will face so-called \u2018baseline\u2019 tariffs of 10%, but much of Character\u2019s manufacturing comes from China where exporters to the US now face levies of 145%. Character Group is set-up just like millions of other companies around the world that took advantage of global trade to improve production and lower prices. So we can only imagine all the similar decisions being made globally to pause output, and to suspend investment and expansion. It sums up why markets hate uncertainty. It\u2019s not because traders are lily-livered. It\u2019s because the economic damage is real, and just as bad un-priceable. Ah, Mr Bond Vigilantes, we\u2019ve been expecting you There\u2019s not point re-litigating the brutal inanity of US policy every Saturday morning. This is going to go on for years, and attention is all Trump wants anyway. But on that note perhaps the one good development this week was the potential re-emergence of the so-called bond vigilantes: We all know former real estate bankruptcy Donald Trump loves cheap debt. So maybe rising bond yields did force his hand towards a pause, rather than, say, Ackman\u2019s whining. Of course, as Cullen Roche notes there\u2019s a lot going on with US bonds: The 10-year interest rate ripped from 3.9% up to 4.5% in four trading sessions. As I write it\u2019s now back to where it was nine trading sessions ago at 4.3%. So, we whipped way lower and then went way higher. Again, it\u2019s all uncertainty. No one knows where inflation and the economy is going. If inflation rips higher then bond yields will follow. If the economy rips lower then bond yields will follow. But we\u2019re in totally uncharted territory because we\u2019ve never had the entire global economy at the mercy of a single unpredictable person writing Tweets sporadically. I talked to some of the largest bond traders in the world in recent days and they\u2019re all so perplexed about it. They described it as \u201cchaos\u201d, \u201cuncertainty\u201d, \u201cmadness\u201d. There are theories floating around about carry trade unwinds, funds imploding, China selling and just bidless markets. I suspect it\u2019s a lot of all of these things. But the uncertainty of it all is the main issue. No one knows where any of this is headed and if you\u2019re someone trying to lend money or set prices in the coming months then good luck guessing where you should be. Trump\u2019s supporters don\u2019t care less that China ultimately buying a lot less US stuff would mean it would have far less need to hold shedloads of US treasuries. Nor that unwinding China\u2019s US debt stockpile would see US rates soar, crippling US households. Remember, this is television! Don\u2019t get hung up on reality. The Mad King Indeed as it\u2019s presently unfolding, US exceptionalism is getting downgraded at a speed that would embarrass a B-Movie scriptwriter. The only thing that\u2019s different about the tariffs mayhem compared to the rest of the MAGA/Trump agenda, is it comes with real-time pricing. The damage is marked-to-market. As blogger ermine puts it , the US is rapidly transitioning from having a POTUS to having a KOTUS, at least in practice. A man whose daily utterances moves trillions in the markets. And who is checked mostly not by conventional counterbalances, but by the japes of sanctioned court jesters. Fun and games So in the spirt of the times \u2013 and since it\u2019s all a game nowadays anyway \u2013 I asked ChatGPT for an appropriate toy: I can\u2019t wait to play with him next time. Historians may someday look back and find something good to say about this entire episode. They turned the murderous Genghis Khan into a nation-builder, after all. Perhaps in some needlessly damaging way, this week really will eventually be seen as an idiotically-implemented check in the very-definitely authoritarian China\u2019s rise to power, for instance. Even forest fires do some good in the long-run. It\u2019s just your bad luck to find yourself in the middle of one. Have a great weekend.

US valuation multiples are extended, and the dollar would presumably devalue further if the US lost its global reserve status. A reduction in the dollar\u2019s value combined with normalisation of equity valuation multiples and a fall in earnings due to a US recession would result in a very significant cumulative impact on a large fraction of a global tracker.

The bad news is they\u2019re only just done it in March before all this kicked off. So you\u2019re stuck with that US overweight in your VWRL tracker. OTOH there are lots of great companies in there which are having seven bells knocked out of their over-heady valuations if you are buying VWRL, either they will roar back by September so nothing to see here, move on and you\u2019ll get the lift. If they don\u2019t, well you\u2019ll lose out as this deadweight gets sold to buy less beaten up stuff in September. I\u2019m not quite ready to sound the requiem for American business even if KOTUS has lost his marbles. If the Americans ever get a functioning democracy and government back, can they add another amendment to what remains of their Constitution that nobody over their retirement age (67 for social security) can stand for President. 7 Curlew April 12, 2025, 12:42 pm @ermine It\u2019s not clear to me what such a rebalance would entail. Aren\u2019t they automatically rebalanced by virtue of the change in values of the constituent companies relative to each other? So, if the collective US companies\u2019 market capitalisation in VWRL falls 10% whilst the rest of the world only fall by, say 5% then isn\u2019t that the rebalance (US 64% would decline to about 62.7%)? Looking at the link you provided, it says they \u201creview\u201d it, which I take to mean that their screening may bring new companies in and existing ones out of the index. 8 Ben Ber April 12, 2025, 12:51 pm @Curlew You are exactly right. The beauty of a world tracker is that you do not need to rebalance, except for when the smallest companies grow to become included at the very bottom of the market capitalisation. (And vice-versa of course.) 9 Paul April 12, 2025, 12:52 pm Was the story \u201cIt\u2019s a Good Life\u201d by Jerome Bixby? I was lucky enough to buy a pile of very old magazines from a flea market, and in it were several copies of Star Science Fiction magazine, this one being from 1953 I think. Absolute classic of the genre. 10 Hugh Tinsley April 12, 2025, 12:52 pm I remember that sci-fi short story from about 50 years ago\u200d. Still chilling and disturbingly apposite. Many thanks for your insights 11 ZXSpectrum48k April 12, 2025, 1:08 pm @TI. \u201cThen again, 10% of the US electorate believes the Earth is flat, so perhaps they would.\u201d Well, as of 2024, 37% still believe in strict creationism i.e. God created human beings in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so! It think it was fairly clear it was the bond market that caused Trump to somewhat reverse course. They seemed fine with the stock market falls as long as US yields fell. Once they started to go up the shadow of Truss caused them to bottle it. The bond market was getting somewhat dysfunctional (and still is). What beggars belief, is that they think don\u2019t seem to connect the dots. It\u2019s like being in the orbit of the Trumpster causes any remaining logic to seep out of their ears. The balance of payments is a conservation law, an accounting identity. If you reduce a trade deficit, you increase the current account, which decreases the capital account i.e. people sell US assets. Market anticipates that. So every asset with \u201cmade in USA\u201d sticker on gets sold. US equities, bonds, the USD etc. What did they expect? As an emerging market trader, it\u2019s interesting to see the US trading like an EM market. It\u2019s being run like an EM autocracy. Insane economic decisions. No rule of law. State capture and corruption. So why shouldn\u2019t it trade like one? Mogul 12 ermine April 12, 2025, 1:17 pm @Curlew #7 I struggled to imagine the process, but I am not so sure that it\u2019s that automatic. Let us consider the top of the current index, which has a weight of x shares of AAPL, y shares of META and so on all the way. It is reasonable to imagine tariffs have more effect on AAPL than say META, because the former deals in Stuff, to the extent of flying 600 tones of iPhones into the US from India Philosophically, what you are saying is that x and y stay the same. Apple\u2019s extra costs will dent their profitability and share price, which will logically reduce the value of the AAPL slice. I can\u2019t argue with that. But it does beg the question of how are x and y determined, and are these invariant with time across all 4228 elements, leaving the share price to to all the tracking? Maven 13 Ducknald Don April 12, 2025, 1:42 pm Presumably they adjust purchases and sales as people invest or draw from the fund. I don\u2019t know if that would be enough though. 14 Curlew April 12, 2025, 2:01 pm @ermine I think it depends what you mean by \u201c weight of x shares\u2026 \u201c. VWRL is market-cap weighted, so must relate to the value of the shares (assuming that there are no significant new share issues or redemptions). VWRL weights AAPL at 4.25%, META at 1.80% at 28 Feb 2025. Let\u2019s assume it\u2019s that at close of business yesterday (it won\u2019t be, of course). Then, if today the share price of AAPL falls 10% for the reasons you cite, and META only falls 2%, then if all other companies remained the same price (they won\u2019t, of course), then the index would recalibrate, leaving AAPL at 3.84% and META at 1.77%. And the VWRL share price would have fallen by 0.46%. Assuming I\u2019ve got the maths right. \ud83d\ude42 @Ducknald Don Yes, I think the market makers can create/destroy ETFs units and I assume the open-ended fund managers the number of units in existence to keep the market price in line with the NAV/market cap. Investment trusts are closed so the number of units remains the same (usually), hence why they have premium and discounts, if I\u2019ve understood correctly. Presumably with ITs, the premium could be eradicated by issuing new shares, or a discount eroded by share buyback (and destruction). 15 Lawkon April 12, 2025, 2:13 pm I came across a very good article recently. Written by an ex- OpenAI employee, a blogger and some super forecasters to estimate what 2027 would look like http://ai-2027.com/ . Their article they wrote in 2021 to predict the next 5 years of ai developments was very accurate. This newest one is genuinely very concerning. 16 Hospitaller April 12, 2025, 2:29 pm So far, while not happy, I am okay with the effect on my portfolio to date. I popped some of my dry powder into equities after the second bad day but have kept a chunk back in case of further declines. The latter are quite likely in my view judging from history; savage declines followed by a dead cat bounce \u2013 followed over the coming weeks by further equities declines? What I am uncertain about is whether the world as we knew it has changed for ever. Serious diversification seems the only remedy and even that may only provide limited relief. The way US treasuries have behaved is rather alarming, going the opposite way eventually to what would usually be expected. I am glad I set a cap on my US equities exposure years ago. The American approach to equities buying seems more like betting than investing; the outsized bounce after Trump delayed tariffs was all too predictable. They seem a very odd nation. Mogul 17 Tom-Baker Dr Who April 12, 2025, 2:38 pm As I wrote last weekend, the odd lack of US Dollar appreciation when the stock market was tanking really caught my eye, and I was really concerned about the US treasury bond market. I\u2019m relieved that I got out right away then, well before the sell off that forced the 90-day pause in the mad tariffs. I sold all my 1-3y treasury etf units when they were still in profit and bought an ultrashort sterling investment grade bond etf with a much higher yield and shorter maturity. We\u2019re on holiday in New York City now and have the impression that his popularity here is tanking really fast. 18 Onedrew April 12, 2025, 2:40 pm @Tom Baker: Which ultrashort sterling investment grade bond etf did you use? Mogul 19 Tom-Baker Dr Who April 12, 2025, 2:52 pm @Onedrew- the iShares one: ERNS 20 Onedrew April 12, 2025, 3:05 pm @Tom Baker: thanks.

Feels Trump is probably right on the symptoms but very very wrong on the cure. Likelihood is that US budget deficits now balloon with tariffs adding fuel rather than water. All while the lack of stability in the dollar has been blowing up trading books. But the debt position (symptoms) looks bad and the tariffs move ultimately feels a badly thought through attempt to fix this. DOGE savings are also somewhat less than Elon promised (he does tend to overestimate by a few orders of magnitude). Overall the US feels toxic but realistically is still priced as a stable exceptional best of class market and still up over 12 months. Europe does feel better and UK is moving towards 4% dividends plus large buybacks but is down over 12 months and has shed all its gains. It\u2019s been a blowout across all assets but it\u2019s hard to say tariffs are priced in correctly comparing moves, more a straight dump. Individual stocks might even bounce up on news of tariff exemptions despite a bad backdrop. So feels early days, but the world index allocation feels a higher risk position after price movements. Probably more big moves to come but there are definitely high yielding assets at the moment without the same exposures as US. Overall the entire financial world seems to have become broken in terms of an ability to value assets and damaged by FOMO and meme trading. The dollar probably does need to weaken really to help support the debt burden but this was probably the time when an experienced hand at the tiller was needed in the US not a clown . 24 Brod April 12, 2025, 3:52 pm Well, like a good passivista I did nothing.

Gold up, lots of cash. BHMG, my insurance, seemed to move positively but was that cause or correlation? I dunno. 25 xeny April 12, 2025, 4:16 pm @ermine >Wonder how often they rebalance I\u2019m not so much thinking about them rebalancing as if it is smart to preemptively move from holding vwrl to holding a set of assets that resembles vwrl after the value of the US component has fallen by say 50% (cumulative effect of a 20% fall in each of earnings, earning multiplier and value of dollar, all of which seem very plausible, is 0.8^3 ~=0.5). Previously when the US market fell, the impact for international investors was attenuated by an opposing increase in the value of the dollar. If it starts being amplified by the dollar weakening, it will be more noticeable. 26 Onedrew April 12, 2025, 4:22 pm @Algernond: I hold CSH2 purely for quick conversion to cash to buy on the dips, which has been useful this week. The rest of the cash is shared between the Fidelity, Vanguard and Royal London money market funds. RL is marginally the best performer of the lot. I will of course dump them if a better alternative for my next-few-years hoard should appear.

And here's DS' take: https://open.substack.com/pub/davidstevenson/p/time-to-dig-out-those-tin-hats-4f1 30 ZXSpectrum48k April 12, 2025, 9:26 pm Functionally, the US and China now have a trade embargo. The tariffs are so large that nothing really can be traded. That is not a major problem right now, since US corps did inventory accumulation into \u201cLiberation Day\u201d. Nonetheless, 60-90 days from now, many of those inventories will be depleted. The Trumpster administration are so dumb, they are only just realizing the disaster this would be. There is simply no way to replace those supply chains in any sensible time period. So expect many more exemptions as they start to uncover the impact of the embargo. The US is going to find itself back in the Prohibition period. Want a new item? Pay $1,500 in the US, or skip over the border to Canada and get it for $750. The amount of smuggling will be insane. Plenty more room for corruption. I think the real question is who is the fall guy for this mess. The Trumpster never takes the blame and his MAGA fanbase, who are as dumb as rocks, will believe whoever he blames. My money is that he\u2019s going to try to pin this on Powell, the Fed Chair. In most EM autocracies, an independent central bank cannot be tolerated by the autocrat. If he fires Powell (and he\u2019s lining up the courts to allow him to do this) and puts in his own stooge in to cut rates, then the US has gone full EM banana republic. The markets will make the last two weeks look like a minor blip. Mogul 31 Delta Hedge April 12, 2025, 11:15 pm Shareholders in the firms of Trump\u2019s technogarchy /industrial enablers are viscerally discovering a realisation Greenspan had in 2008: \u201cI made a mistake in presuming..the self-interest of organisations..were such that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms.\u201d \u2018PayPal mafia\u2019 of Musk and Thiel thought they were acting in their shareholders\u2019 rational self interest in backing Trump 2.0. Germany\u2019s industrialists made a similar mistake in the 30s. Autocracy rarely ends well, for anyone. @ZX #30: if (big if) it looks as though Trump is going to go full on Peron, and sacks Powell, then I guess those with access to HFs turn to likes of Universa / Spitznagel (or otherwise to IVOL, VIXY or VXX). For UCITS constrained mortals like myself \u2013 unable to access either HFs or (FAPP) US ETFs \u2013 maybe it would mean loading up on SGLN and/or GDX and Winton and/or BHMG. 32 dearieme April 13, 2025, 1:23 am Typo: Cash ISA picks for 2025/26 Maven 33 Prospector April 13, 2025, 7:29 am @ermine/@Curlew/@Ben Ber (#6,#7#8) For market cap weighted index trackers the \u201cobvious\u201d rebalances are when index constituents change . Eg following merger, company going private or new IPO. And at very bottom end (in terms of weights) when something gets too small to be in the index and gets ejected or vice versa. The less obvious need for rebalances comes because the indices being tracked are price return and there will be dividends that will need to be reinvested. I was also wondering if rebalances are needed if the exchange rates change. Eg if index has 4% AAPL and 1% NESN what happens if dollar loses 25%. My initial reaction was portfolio now needs a greater weight of NESN. But I think as long as the index is defined in equivalent currency terms then the weights will shift accordingly. Except at the margins eg more US companies end up \u201ctoo small\u201d and some other non-USD names will leap frog them in. On the subject of rebalancing interesting the two pieces on rebalancing portfolio weights focused on accumulation. I\u2019d be interested whether rebalances make more difference in deaccumulation when considered alongside sequence of return risk. Feels like an area worthy of research.

Fingers crossed Mogul 36 Nearly There April 13, 2025, 8:53 am @ermine#6 This is a guess, but for the broader indexes, funds normally hold only a *sample* of the index they aim to track. That will lead to sampling errors, which may need to be addressed. Imagine the absurd case where the US portion of the fund was represented by a random sample of only 7 stocks that just happened to be the Magnificent 7. That sample isn\u2019t a great representation of the whole of the US market, so the value of the sample would drift away from the thing it is meant to represent. Rebalancing would correct that drift. Of course, the sample sizes are likely to be far larger for the more significant parts of the index. That gives a greater chance of the under-performers and over-performers that are over- and under-represented in the sample to roughly balance out, making the sample more representative in the places where it matters most. And the Heard and McDonald Islands probably aren\u2019t in the sample at all. The sample *will* drift if over-represents or under-represents, say, a 100-bagger. The only times it won\u2019t drift at all is: \u2013 if everything is held in precisely the right proportion: sample size is 100% so it isn\u2019t sampling, or \u2013 if the errors miraculously completely cancel eachother out every day for eternity, or \u2013 it tweaks the sample ratios to correct the drift (rebalancing). Presumably the frequency of rebalancing is chosen to minimise costs whilst maintaining a sufficiently small drift from the objective.

My air fryer often renders oil from what I cook, but I've never used cooking oil with it. Frozen seasoned fries go in frozen and 12 minutes later they're delicious. An air fryer would be more accurately named a convection roaster. I'm super pleased with the way it cooks and the results with lots of different foods. The \"set it and forget it\" is an especially convenient feature. It's even replaced my microwave oven as my most used small kitchen appliance.

It was very impressive and useful. We haven't enjoyed our airfryer this much especially that this has the largest capacity/volume of them all. I can even cook an entire chicken or reheat a rotisserie chicken. The controls are moody but the most frequently used ones work just fine. It was easy to clean. Then just yesterday, February 26, 2024, it just plummeted from appearing not able to warm up our food enough when it usually did before and then afterwards, it just died suddenly while I was reheating food. No power and even the power button that lights up when you plug the cord was gone. Tried to move to other outlets that work and nope-- still doesn't work. Read a lot of reviews on the internet and Amazon and interestingly, a number had the same problem just with varying time, but most consistently after 1 year. So our best airfyer ever turned out tragically as the most shortlived one too. I feel bad to give it just 2 stars when it surely could have been 5 stars. But a shortlived airfryer no matter how excellent it was could not be pleasing to anyone who buys it.\" 1 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Sign up for a Slickdeals account to remove this ad.

The air fryer is much faster, browns better, and is more efficient when cooking for one person. Seems to sear in juices better as well. I don't use my convection oven that much since having the choice, although it still gets used for brownies, cornbread, etc. I'm amazed at the versatility of the air fryer; it does everything well. 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Santa_Claus 9h ago Apr 13, 2025 1:08 AM 9,425 Posts Joined Sep 2007 9h ago Apr 13, 2025 1:08 AM Santa_Claus 9h ago Apr 13, 2025 1:08 AM 9,425 Posts Um this is a good deal? 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link 1 Reply BabyBubba Original Poster Pro 7h ago Apr 13, 2025 2:13 AM 3,564 Posts Joined Apr 2021 7h ago Apr 13, 2025 2:13 AM BabyBubba Original Poster Pro 7h ago Apr 13, 2025 2:13 AM 3,564 Posts Quote from Santa_Claus : Um this is a good deal?

I believe the rounded design to these bowls allows air to circulate far better leading to not just faster cooking but dryer and crunchier surfaces of stuff like fries. No idea for this brand or design but my vortex works very well and very fast.

It was very impressive and useful. We haven't enjoyed our airfryer this much especially that this has the largest capacity/volume of them all. I can even cook an entire chicken or reheat a rotisserie chicken. The controls are moody but the most frequently used ones work just fine. It was easy to clean. Then just yesterday, February 26, 2024, it just plummeted from appearing not able to warm up our food enough when it usually did before and then afterwards, it just died suddenly while I was reheating food. No power and even the power button that lights up when you plug the cord was gone. Tried to move to other outlets that work and nope-- still doesn't work. Read a lot of reviews on the internet and Amazon and interestingly, a number had the same problem just with varying time, but most consistently after 1 year. So our best airfyer ever turned out tragically as the most shortlived one too. I feel bad to give it just 2 stars when it surely could have been 5 stars. But a shortlived airfryer no matter how excellent it was could not be pleasing to anyone who buys it.\" 1 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Sign up for a Slickdeals account to remove this ad.

The air fryer is much faster, browns better, and is more efficient when cooking for one person. Seems to sear in juices better as well. I don't use my convection oven that much since having the choice, although it still gets used for brownies, cornbread, etc. I'm amazed at the versatility of the air fryer; it does everything well. 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link Santa_Claus 9h ago Apr 13, 2025 1:08 AM 9,425 Posts Joined Sep 2007 9h ago Apr 13, 2025 1:08 AM Santa_Claus 9h ago Apr 13, 2025 1:08 AM 9,425 Posts Um this is a good deal? 1 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link 1 Reply BabyBubba Original Poster Pro 7h ago Apr 13, 2025 2:13 AM 3,564 Posts Joined Apr 2021 7h ago Apr 13, 2025 2:13 AM BabyBubba Original Poster Pro 7h ago Apr 13, 2025 2:13 AM 3,564 Posts Quote from Santa_Claus : Um this is a good deal?

I believe the rounded design to these bowls allows air to circulate far better leading to not just faster cooking but dryer and crunchier surfaces of stuff like fries. No idea for this brand or design but my vortex works very well and very fast.

A pair of teeth-whitening pens , which are SO much easier to use than traditional white strips. Just swipe it on and let the gel sit for 30 minutes \u2014 and eventually, you'll see years and years of stains start to disappear. This is a must for all my fellow coffee connoisseurs. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I\u2019ve tried a bunch of teeth whitening products in the past, and they\u2019ve always left my teeth feeling sensitive. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve tried a whitening product and was skeptical to try another one, but after searching around, I decided to give it a try, and I am happy to say that I have not felt any sensitivity at all! The instructions say to use it 2x a day, but for now, I\u2019m just using it 1x a day as I want to see how my teeth feel and adjust. I\u2019ve been using the product for about a month now, and I have been able to see some results, but only after I took a photo did I realize it has been working so fast. I have pretty white teeth, so I\u2019m pretty amazed at how well it works. It may take longer for those with darker teeth.\" \u2014 Adam Get a two-pack from Amazon for $18.95 (available in two sizes and various packs). 2. A flat outlet cover connected to a power strip so you can finally push your furniture all the way back to the wall! If you have an outlet that's basically rendered useless because it's behind your couch, bed, or other big piece of furniture, this is the solution you never knew you needed. It's also way more aesthetically pleasing than having a mess of tangled cords sprouting from the wall. www.amazon.com Promising reviews: \"Makes an incredible difference as my furnishings now sit flush against the walls while still accessing the outlets.\" \u2014 Dwags \"Incredible product! Works perfectly and provides a streamlined look throughout the room. I used one in all my outlets to provide a uniform look and can\u2019t believe how well they work and how good they look.\" \u2014 JAD Get the three-foot version with three outlets from Amazon for $23.95 (also available in various lengths, extension options, and for inverted outlets). 3. A Bounce wrinkle release spray in a convenient travel size so you can take it with you on your next vacay. Seriously, who has time to iron while traveling?! There's also no telling if that dusty hotel iron is actually going to work. All you have to do is spray, tug the fabric a few times, then smooth the wrinkles away with your hand. It's also perfect for refreshing any clothes you plan to wear a few times during your trip, thanks to the fresh scent. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Hate dragging out the old hotel iron and board, so I just spray my wrinkled clothes with this, and viola! Takes the wrinkles out, and off I go \u2014 no wrestling while putting the iron and board away. I even have a small travel iron or use my hair styling irons if I want a better finish, but this usually does the job nicely.\" \u2014 Audie Get it from Amazon for $6.05 . 4. A grout ink pen \u2014 it'll take the space between your tiles from grimy to shiny in a few simple swipes. This won't clean your grout, but it'll make it look brand-new. It's like a more productive version of an adult coloring book! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I was pleasantly surprised by how far these went. I did the entire floor of my large master bathroom, plus a little of the shower, with one pen. It is pretty forgiving, and you have quite a bit of working time before it dries completely. This was not a quick task, but it went faster than I thought it would. I was worried the white would look too bright, but it just makes everything look so much cleaner. Very happy with this product!\" \u2014 Jenelle Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (also available with a wide tip). 5. A handheld garment steamer to get those pesky wrinkles out of clothes without ever having to worry about pulling out the ironing board. It heats up in just 30 seconds, and one tank will get you 15 minutes of continuous use. Reviewers say it's super lightweight and that they're able to get a surprising amount of clothes done with just one tank. amazon.com Promising review: \"What a fantastic little gadget! I hate ironing. Hate it with a passion. This little miracle worker makes things easier for me. It takes away the wrinkles so quickly. Wow!\" \u2014 Tes Get one from Amazon for $22.47+ (available in three colors). 6. A bottle of Goo Gone foaming spray that's specifically designed to win the fight against the greasy nastiness that's been living on your oven door for far too long now. You can also use it to spruce up range hoods (it's probably way dirtier than you think right now), microwaves, pots and pans, and any food-prep surfaces. www.amazon.com Just spray and wipe \u2014 or leave it on for up to two minutes for caked-on messes. Promising review: \"Wow! A degreaser that actually works! I love the foam, which starts to work immediately on my stove top as well as cookware and other kitchen surfaces.\" \u2014 P. Webb Get it from Amazon for $7.34+ (available in two sizes and a two-pack). 7. And! An all-natural oven scrub made with gritty pumice stone so you can really go to town on that pizza that exploded and left a mess everywhere. It'll even clean all the hard-to-reach spots on your racks...or you can just clean your oven door to create the illusion that it's fully clean. Everneat/Etsy You can also use this on porcelain sinks, grout, toilet bowls, stovetop burners, and stainless steel cookware. Avoid using on aluminum and nonstick surfaces, though! Promising review: \"Finally tackled the rings on our stove top with this scrub and a reusable paper towel (as I was worried about using a scourer on an easily scratched surface), and the rings came right off! These are those 'oh, crap, the pot boiled over' rings that I ignored that lead to my stove top looking a bit crusty. The oven scrub ate them right off and left my oven and stove top looking great.\" \u2014 Jessie Bono Everneat is a small Etsy shop based in Fairfield, Connecticut, that specializes in cleaning products. Get it from Everneat on Etsy for $20 (available in a plastic or glass jar). 8. A two-pack of reusable mop pads because it's time to say goodbye to the wasteful disposable ones you've been spending way too much money on. These even have helpful Velcro straps so the pads won't go flying off when you're scrubbing your kitchen floor. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com They're compatible with both the original Swiffer and the Swiffer Wet Jet ! Promising review: \"The Velcro closure alone is worth the purchase. It was really easy to put on (no more pinched fingers) and the hold is very strong. No more having to handle the dirty, drippy sheets to try to reattach them in the middle of cleaning the floor. I noticed that my floors are cleaner because the microfiber absorbs more and doesn't just push the grime around the floor. Also, these can be washed in the washing machine for the next use.\" \u2014 Rosemary P. Get a pack of two from Amazon for $10.95 . 9. A bathroom cleaner made with natural ingredients (like tea tree and eucalyptus essential oils) to leave your tiles shining and your tub as sparkly as the day you moved in. Plus, it's free from fumes and synthetic dyes, so you won't have to worry about any mid-chore headaches. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have an old shower/bathtub. I tried name-brand shower cleaners and bleach to try to clean the soap scum off the tiles and tub. I had no luck and I would cough and get sick because of how strong the smell was. I thought I would try this to save my lungs. I sprayed my entire shower and left it for about 15 minutes. Came back and rinsed off the walls, and they were shiny! I've never had such a clean shower. The smell is amazing and subtle. All I smell is tea tree and it didn't affect me at all. The price is also a good deal since the bottle is pretty large.\" \u2014 Amber Erwin Get a pack of two from Amazon for $15.99 . 10. A bottle of anti-fog drops for the glasses that'll have you singing, \"I can see clearly now the fog is gone!\" \u2014 especially when you step outside on a 90-degree day after being in the sweet, sweet AC all day. Simply add a few drops to your lenses, let it air dry for 15-20 seconds, then wipe clean and go about your fog-free day! Amazon These are safe for anti-reflective lenses! Promising review: \"I\u2019ve tried a few different sprays, wipes, and liquids like this during the pandemic and this is the *only* one that works. It lasts way longer and there\u2019s hardly any fog on my glasses even when it\u2019s 30 degrees outside.\" \u2014 Pandamonium Optix 55 is a small business specializing in glasses care. Get it from Amazon for $15.55 . 11. A stainless-steel tongue cleaner so you can scrape away all the nastiness in your mouth that's been giving you a case of morning breath. It's gross and satisfying in equal measure. amazon.com Promising review: \"Unfortunately I, like many, suffer from bad breath and have tried so many things to stop it. I read that sometimes it's the germs on your tongue that can cause it, so I went crazy trying to brush my tongue. Of course, we all know how that ends \u2014 gagging, watery eyes, and it still looks like that gross film is on your tongue. I finally decided that maybe it was time to get a tongue cleaner, and it had to be a stainless-steel one because they are easier to clean and sterilize. This product is really easy to use, and I can get very far back on my tongue without activating my gag reflex. Also, it doesn't have the feeling that brushing with a toothbrush does. This cleaner just glides across my tongue, taking all the icky germs and bad breath with it. I love my nice new fresh breath and bolster of confidence!\" \u2014 jordanlauren Get it from Amazon for $8.39 (also available in a pack of two and 12). 12.

It's designed to work in seconds; just apply with a damp cloth in circular motions and wipe away with a paper towel or cloth to reveal the shiny showroom-worthy shower doors of your dreams. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This product works beautifully. I tried a lot of products to remove the hard water from my glass shower. I have to admit the first time I used it with a cloth, it was not very effective. The second time, I used a nonabrasive sponge for glass. It turned out beautiful, just like the first day the glass was installed .\" \u2014 EJP Get it from Amazon for $11.65 . 13. An all-natural leather conditioner because I'm here to remind you that your go-to handbag used to be a completely different shade of brown when you first bought it. This will bring it (and any other leather goods!) back to life \u2014 just swirl it on with a soft cloth and wipe away. amazon.com The brand recommends letting the leather dry for 24-48 hours. Promising review: \"Almost out after doing it on my entire collection. Worked great on a variety of colors. Sperrys, Clark\u2019s, and other dress shoes were all able to be helped. Would recommend it especially if you are afraid of the dyes or larger kits.\" \u2014 iamjaredm Otter Wax is a small business specializing in leather and fabric care. Get it from Amazon for $9.95 . 14. An over-the-drain hair catcher that'll collect all your loose strands in a tidy pile that's super easy to clean up. Reviewers say the silicone material helps keep it in place, and the drain holes are just big enough to let water through \u2014 meaning you won't be standing in a puddle of water by the end of your shower. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I've been very impressed! It's tall enough to fit easily over my pop-up drain, and (even without suction cups) the weighted top keeps it in place. I have medium-length hair and seem to shed almost as much as my cat, but the drain protector catches it all, and the hair is easily removed and tossed away. Best of all, the silicone doesn't hold onto mildew or mold. I have been able to spray and wipe away any grime with very little effort. It looks like this drain protector will last a very long time . This has been a very worthy purchase!\" \u2014 Suneimi Get it from Amazon for $11.99 . 15. Ice molds to take your beverage game to the next level. The slow-melting spheres will chill your drink without watering it down \u2014 and you'll totally feel like you're in an episode of Mad Men . Amazon, www.amazon.com The lids on the molds are tight-fitting (no freezer spills!) and stackable to save space. Promising review: \"I bought these molds to make ice spheres to add to whiskey drinks and other concoctions served in an old fashioned glass, and they have been outstanding. They are durable, easy to clean, and they produce a sphere that is the perfect size for a standard old fashioned glass. Because they take longer to melt, the ice spheres don't water my drinks down as much, which I appreciate both for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. I have always hated watery soda, so I rarely put ice in it before I got these sphere molds, but now I can enjoy ice cold soda without it getting weak. If I am drinking an old fashioned, these spheres add just the right amount of water as they melt, mellowing the drink out without making it too bland. Also, and this is important, my friends think they are cool. I don't know what it is about a large ball of ice, but people get oddly excited when you make them a drink with one. Some of the simple things in life are the most satisfying, and this is a simple thing that people get pumped about, which amuses me.\" \u2014 John H. Get a two-pack from Amazon for $11.99 . 16. A slicer and pit remover that'll make it so much easier to make avocado toast for the seventh time this week. Use the knife side to cut your avocado in half, pop the pit out with the circular remover in the handle, then flip over to the slicer to cut out perfect strips. Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \" Avocado? Yes, please! This tool is awesome. Easy to cut open the fruit. Pit remover works well, just push onto the pit and give it a twist, and the pit pops right out. The best part is the slicer. Makes beautiful slices for a great presentation.\" \u2014 NPR Man Get it from Amazon for $9.98 . 17. A pumice cleaning stone to break down all of the nastiness in your toilet and have it looking sparkly and presentable when you have last-minute guests over. Just wet it with water, get to scrubbing, then store it in the included carrying case until your next deep-cleaning session! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I have a 19-year-old master bathroom toilet that had accumulated some nasty stains over time that regular toilet brushes and cleaning products just would not remove. I decided to try this pumice stone, figuring that the worst that could happen would be that it scratched the porcelain, and I'd have to replace the toilet. Which was what I would have had to do anyway if I couldn't get the disgusting stains out. The pumice stone worked like a charm! Given the nature and severity of the stains, it required some elbow grease, but 10 minutes later, I had a new-looking bowl, and I saw no signs of scratching. I am very happy with this purchase...well worth the very low price!\" \u2014 Happy Retiree Get it from Amazon for $9.26 (also available in packs of two and four). 18. A beloved car interior cleaner that'll have your ride back to the way it looked before that beach trip left it completely covered in wet sand. It's designed to work on leather, vinyl, plastic, rubber, and glass \u2014 so every inch of your car is about to look fresh off the lot. amazon.com Promising review: \"This does exactly what I wanted \u2014 clean all the interior surfaces of my car while not leaving any residues, streaks, or strong odors. I first used this on my 4-month-old Grand Cherokee Trailhawk that was CAKED in dust (inside!) from a recent off-road adventure. The Total Interior cleaner cleaned all my surfaces \u2014 dash, screen, leather seats, etc. without leaving any streaky residues or strong odors, good or bad. After things settled my car looked and smelled new again!\" \u2013 T. Porter Get it from Amazon for $11.97+ (available in three sizes and various bundles). 19. A handheld milk frother so you can try all those delicious-looking latte recipes you've seen on TikTok. For the cost of about three cappuccinos, you can whip up all the frothed milk topping you could ever want. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com This requires two AA batteries (not included). Promising review: \"This makes the creamiest froth ever! I am completely blown away by the results of this device. I had no idea that I could make froth at home like this. This changes my whole cappuccino experience!!!\" \u2014 Wells Family Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in 27 colors). 20. An absolutely genius tool that lets you easily spread butter on your pans before cooking or directly on hot foods like corn on the cob or fresh bread. No more ~butter fingers~! The Magnetack/Etsy Promising review: \"Absolutely perfect. It holds a whole stick of butter, and the butter stays in place, unlike with some of the other products on the market that are supposed to serve the same purpose.\" \u2014 Michelle The Magnetack is a small Etsy seller based in Miami.

I wasn't sure if it would work well on my emerald engagement ring since it's mostly advertised for diamonds, but I thought I'd give it a try. I have been wearing the ring since getting engaged in October, and even though I had it cleaned at the jeweler's in April, it just didn't seem as bright as it was when it was new, and I thought it would just always be a little cloudy. But after cleaning it once with the Dazzle Stik, I was blown away by the difference \u2014 it looks as bright and sparkly as when I first got it! I'm so glad I didn't buy an ultrasonic cleaner, since this is so much less expensive and easier and gentler. It took me less than a minute to clean, and I can do it whenever I want! And it's honestly better than when the jeweler cleaned it. So thrilled!\" \u2014 KFray Get it from Amazon for $9.48 (also available in various packs). 22.

Purging and getting rid of so much stuff that I\u2019ve accumulated throughout the years was life-changing! I had quite a bit of really nice bedding that I wanted to keep but had very little storage space. I decided to order these jumbo bags for King down duvets, thick blankets, and king-sized pillows. I was amazed at how much these held, how easy they were to pack/vacuum, and how much I could fit in such a small space! \" \u2014 Raquel Moss Get a pack of three jumbo-sized bags from Amazon for $14.99 (also available in three other sizes, a variety pack, and multiple pack sizes). 23.

Promising review: \"Love to grill burgers and my wife loves to stuff our veal/lamb/pork/beef burgers with all sorts of cheeses and veggies. The problem has been that sometimes the burgers crumble on the grill and don't look so appetizing when served. No more. The burger press burgers are loaded up but look just perfect when plated or laid on a big roll. And I don't have to worry about them on the grill. You can really load them up, and they cook perfectly. Simple but great product.\" \u2014 Jerry O'Connor Get it from Amazon for $19.95 . 24.

Promising review: \"I normally don\u2019t review products on Amazon, but I was so impressed by this kit; you all need to know how amazing it is. The kit comes with everything needed to recondition your headlight lens. Don\u2019t waste your money on kits that don\u2019t have a drill attachment. The results were better for me than the kit from Turtle Wax that requires hand sanding. Wear a dust mask, follow the directions, watch a YouTube video if needed, and take your time. The photos are from a 10-year-old Lexus with cloudy headlights. It took me about 45 minutes to get the headlight lens smooth and clear! I was amazed at how much brighter the lights are and how you can now see the side market lights. This kit is a good value! \" \u2014 Reviews Get it from Amazon for $15.98 . 31.

Amazon, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Over the years, my sloppy 'hair-dying job at home' has left several spots on my white bathroom walls. This is exactly what I was looking for. If you're unsure which color to use (no need to be an exact match for this type of touch-ups), you can contact the company and they'll send you a color chart for free. This is like a whiteout for the imperfections. I didn't want to have to paint the entire bathroom for some small spots, but those spots were bothering me for certain. Now I don't even know where those spots are anymore, and the walls look normal. This is such a lifesaver.\" \u2014 mrsj Get it from Amazon for $18.95 (available in 24 shades). 32. An enzyme-based laundry stain remover so you won't have to panic the next time you accidentally get some pizza sauce on your favorite white top. It's a plant-powered formula (so no chemicals like ammonia or bleach that might harm some fabrics) and is super simple to use: spray the stain, wait 15 minutes for fresh stains or 8 hours for set-in stains, then wash as you normally would (though the brand recommends adding an extra rinse to your cycle for best results!). www.amazon.com Promising review: \"For whatever reason, I am ALWAYS spilling things on my shirts, and I cook every night (sometimes I remember the apron, sometimes I don't). My clothes are a mess by the end of the day. I'm not proud of it, but there it is. I have tried EVERYTHING there is to remove stains and this is the absolute BEST thing out there. (There is simply not a major stain remover that I have not tried.) The only thing close is a long presoak (I mean like six hours) in Oxyclean. With Puracy, you get the best result by doing it well in advance, but for me, that is another plus because I would far rather spray them when I put them in the hamper than do it all at once just before I do the laundry. It seems to get everything out, and I've never had any trouble with damaged fabric. I don't really review very much, but this is seriously outstanding .\" \u2014 NYC Buyer Puracy is a Texas-based, family-owned small business specializing in plant-based, chemical-free, hypoallergenic home products, with a donation made to local families in need with a portion of every purchase.

I sprayed a small patch in the evening and let it sit overnight. The next morning, the grout where I had sprayed was as white as if it were brand new. I decided to spray the entire wall and part of the roof. The next day everything I sprayed had no visible mold. By the third night, I was pretty much spraying everything left in the shower. This stuff is amazing.\" \u2014 John Werner Get it from Amazon for $15.99 (available in three sizes and multipacks). 34.

Perfectly contoured to the rounded corners used by Lodge in their pans so you'll get any food stuck to your pan off easily. The plastic is sturdy and malleable but not so much that it will deform. Been using them for a couple months now, and I haven't had them break . And since I still can't get a properly seasoned coating on my pans, I have a lot of food that sticks (my fault), but these scrapers get pretty much everything off easily.\" \u2014 JGtz Get a two-pack from Amazon for $6.79 . 36.

Prime Video, one of the best streaming services , proudly revealed that Reacher season 3 has become Prime Video\u2019s biggest returning show , thanks to 54.6 million viewers globally within the first 19 days. So, it's certainly one of the best Prime Video shows that's ready to return for more.

Reacher season 4 release date prediction A post shared by Amazon MGM Studios (@amazonmgmstudios) A photo posted by on There\u2019s no Reacher season 4 release date just yet, but we do know that the show was renewed back in October 2024. Speaking to The Mirror in February, Child said: \u201cSo we\u2019re ready to go on season four. Obviously, we can\u2019t reveal anything yet, but it\u2019s another good\u2019un, I\u2019ll tell you. It\u2019s going to be great.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ll see you next year and we\u2019ll talk about it,\u201d possibly hinting that Reacher season 4 will premiere in 2026.

If Prime Video continues releasing annually, it could well be early 2026. When Child discussed future seasons of Reacher in an exclusive chat with TechRadar, he revealed filming will commence sooner than you might think: \u201cIt\u2019s written and it\u2019s ready to go. It\u2019s going to start shooting in the summer.\u201d Reacher season 4 trailer: is there one? (Image credit: Amazon Prime Video) Given the cast and crew haven\u2019t started filming yet, there\u2019s no trailer to share. Historically, trailers come out a lot nearer to the release of the show. So, for a Reacher season 4 trailer, we imagine a wait until at least late 2025, early 2026. Reacher season 4 predicted cast Alan Ritchson will surely reprise his role as the titular, Jack Reacher (Image credit: Amazon MGM Studios) Full spoilers follow for Reacher season 3. Based on the Reacher season 3 finale, this is the cast we predict will return for Reacher season 4. Though, at time of writing, these characters are yet to be confirmed. Aside from Reacher himself: Alan Ritchson as Jack Reacher Sonya Cassidy as Susan Duffy Anthony Michael Hall as Zachary Beck Maria Sten as Frances Neagley Malcolm Goodwin as Oscar Finlay Willa Fitzgerald as Roscoe Conklin Brian Tee as Francis Xavier Quinn / Julius McCabe Reacher season 4 plot rumors Reacher season 3 ended with an almighty brawl (Image credit: Amazon Prime Video) Full spoilers follow for Reacher seasons 1-3. Plus, potential spoilers for Reacher season 4. Jack Reacher is a man on a mission, or several missions if you take all seasons so far into consideration. He\u2019s been repeatedly ensnared in conspiracies that put a lot of lives at risk, including his own. From false murder accusations to going deep undercover to retrieve a lost DEA agent, following Lee Child's novels has given plenty of plot for the show to follow along with. And season 3 saw Reacher\u2019s feud with villains (new and old), Xavier Quinn and Zachary Beck, come to a head. The finale episode, titled \u2018Unfinished Business\u2019, saw Reacher's team break down a crime syndicate, run by Beck, by infiltrating his base. But, in order to do so, he had to come up against Beck's towering bodyguard, Paulie . And that led to an almighty brawl placing brains against brawn. At the end of it all, he sat down with Neagley and talked about the real reason Reacher gets embroiled in so much trouble, because he hates the \"big guy\". For season 4's plot then, the best place to turn is to the books. Season 1 was adapted from Killing Floor , Child\u2019s debut novel, season 2 from Bad Luck and Trouble, his 11th novel, and season 3 from Persuader , his 7th novel. So, they're not going in book order, but they're certainly going from the books. Neagley tells Reacher how it is (Image credit: Prime Video) While there\u2019s been speculation around Personal , book 19, being the basis of season 4 given how the flashbacks in Persuader and in season 3 line up with the plot, there's been no confirmation . Speaking to The Independent though, Child revealed book 22 is one he\u2019d love to adapt: \u201cIt was well received but The Midnight Line is one of my favourites because it was an opioid book, but it was written from the point of view of the addict with tremendous sympathy.\u201d Adding: \u201cI wonder if it will ever get made. We have to see whether we ever choose that one, but I\u2019d love to see how it comes out.\u201d And Child supports that the show can jump around the book order, saying he: \u201cvery deliberately wrote the book series so you did not have any prior knowledge. I wanted people to be able to pick up any title anywhere and have a really satisfying story, so we can take the same approach.\u201d Which direction Reacher season 4 decides to go in is entirely down to Lee Child and showrunner Nick Santora, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Where to watch Reacher All seasons of Reacher, exclusively on Prime Video (Image credit: Prime Video) Reacher seasons 1 to 3 can be streamed exclusively on Prime Video. Finished them all and eager for more? Check out these 6 muscular thrillers to watch while you wait . Will there be more seasons of Reacher? A post shared by Maria Sten (@mariasten) A photo posted by on It's incredibly likely. Reacher season 4 was greenlit months before season 3 came out, and we wouldn't be surprised to hear about season 5 in a similar way. And, of course, there's all the books that Lee Child has written of the Jack Reacher series \u2014 currently totalling 29. But, it's not just Reacher that'll be on the scene. In October 2024, Prime Video announced a spin-off series, focused on Frances Neagley, a recurring character in the Reacher series. And in February, the show officially went into production with Maria Sten pictured holding the clapperboard for episode one.

An Eddie Bauer blanket for $5, Community coffee for $2.50 a pound, and an Old Timer midsize folding knife for $9. Lots of other great deals too. An Amazon Basics microcut paper shredder for $28, a nice 3/8\" ratchet for $3, and a rice cooker I use regularly for $8. All within the last couple of months, and all high quality stuff at a deep discount. I watch Woot's offerings daily; most of their prices are nothing special but a select few are amazing. 3 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link ontech Yesterday Apr 12, 2025 9:58 PM 243 Posts Joined Jan 2010 Yesterday Apr 12, 2025 9:58 PM ontech Yesterday Apr 12, 2025 9:58 PM 243 Posts Quote from liejian : amazon shows this as having a ceramic nonstick coating but cant be confirmed on instant pot's site.

More like screaming from a cancer diagnosis. I really don't understand why people feel the need to scream safety fears on a deals site. This is a great price. Either buy it or don't. But please stop whining about cancer. It's so lame and tiresome for the rest of us. If you want to express a product safety concern, take it to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Expect eye rolls when you bring it up here. 4 Like Like Helpful Funny Not helpful Reply Copy Comment Link 3 Replies gobblygook 8h ago Apr 13, 2025 1:38 AM 2,514 Posts Joined Jan 2007 8h ago Apr 13, 2025 1:38 AM gobblygook 8h ago Apr 13, 2025 1:38 AM 2,514 Posts Quote from BabyBubba : I really don't understand why people feel the need to scream safety fears on a deals site.

I want to know about the product I'm considering, and that includes various aspects from smelly plastics to potential health/safety concerns. A deal isn't just about low price for some of us.
