China, where Apple manufactures most of its iPhones, has been hit the heaviest with tariffs by Trump administration. The tech major has been steadily building capacity in India with contract manufacturers Tata Electronics and Foxconn. Two Sharp with ET: Apple dumps China, India gains big; border tensions hits Sensex hard Apple is looking to shift the assembly of all iPhones it sells in the US to India by next year, the Financial Times reported on Friday citing people familiar with the matter. The pivot away from China comes in the backdrop of US President Donald Trump 's reciprocal tariffs, which have hit the Asian economy the hardest. #Pahalgam Terrorist Attack India pulled the plug on IWT when Pakistanis are fighting over water What makes this India-Pakistan standoff more dangerous than past ones The problem of Pakistan couldn't have come at a worse time for D-St Apple has been steadily building capacity in India, with contract manufacturers Foxconn and Tata Electronics. As of March, Foxconn \u2014 Apple's largest manufacturer in India \u2014 sold shipped smartphones worth $1.31 billion in March, the highest ever in a single month. This was the same as its total exports in January and February combined, according to customs data for the month. Tata Electronics ' iPhone exports jumped 63% over the previous month, touching $612 million in March. After Trump's tariff announcements earlier this month, Apple rushed to export available India-made iPhones to the US to avoid high tariffs imposed on China, the FT report said. The US accounted for about 28% of Apple\u2019s 232.1 billion global iPhone shipments in 2024, according to the International Data Corporation. Apple\u2019s India push is part of the strategy to diversify its supply chain but goes further and faster than investors appreciate, with a goal to source from India the entirety of the more than 60 million iPhones sold annually in the US by the end of 2026. The plan would mean Apple doubling the iPhone output in India, after investing heavily over two decades to create a world-beating production line in China that helped its rise to become a $3 trillion tech giant. iPhone assembly is the culmination of the production process, where hundreds of components are components are brought together to build the final product. Apple is still heavily reliant on Chinese suppliers for these parts. Live Events Trump had initially imposed reciprocal tariffs of more than 100% on imports from China, but then stayed those on smartphones temporarily. The devices still attract a separate 20% levy that applies to all imports from China.

Navigation Verified details These details have been verified by PyPI Maintainers jaywonchung michahn Unverified details These details have not been verified by PyPI Project links Documentation Homepage Repository Meta License: Apache Software License (Apache 2.0) Author: Zeus Team Tags apple, apple-silicon, macos, energy, mlsys, deep-learning Requires: Python >=3.9 Provides-Extra: lint , test , dev Classifiers License OSI Approved :: Apache Software License Programming Language Python :: 3.9 Python :: 3.10 Python :: 3.11 Python :: 3.12 Python :: 3.13 Topic Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence Report project as malware Project description In-Code Energy Measurement on Apple Silicon \uf8ff \u26a1 A lightweight, header-only C++ library for precisely measuring energy consumed by arbitrary code snippets on Apple Silicon processors. Also available in Python, installable via pip . This library is used to provide macOS support for Zeus , a framework for deep learning energy measurement and optimization. Installation Python Install the package using pip: pip install zeus-apple-silicon Then, import the necessary components in your Python script: from zeus_apple_silicon import AppleEnergyMonitor , AppleEnergyMetrics # or: import zeus_apple_silicon C++ Copy/move the header file apple_energy.hpp (found in the apple_energy/ directory of the source repository) into your project. Include the header in your C++ files: #include \"apple_energy.hpp\" Link your executable against Apple's CoreFoundation framework and the IOReport library (part of IOKit); both dependencies are available by default on nearly all macOS devices. The library requires C++17. Manual Compilation (g++/clang++) - add necessary flags to your compile command: g++ your_code.cpp -o your_executable -std = c++17 -framework CoreFoundation -lIOReport # or clang++ your_code.cpp -o your_executable -std = c++17 -framework CoreFoundation -lIOReport CMake - add the following to your CMakeLists.txt file, where your_target_name is the name of your executable or library target: target_link_libraries ( your_target_name PRIVATE \"-framework CoreFoundation\" IOReport ) Usage Overview The library operates by defining measurement windows. You mark the beginning and end of a code section you want to measure. Start a measurement window : use AppleEnergyMonitor::begin_window(label) to indicate you want energy measurement to start at that line of code. Each window needs a string label passed in as an argument. The code being measured : The start of the window should be followed by the code you want to measure energy for. End & Retrieve Results : indicate where you want your measurement window to end by using AppleEnergyMonitor::end_window(label) with the same label you used to mark the window's start. The AppleEnergyMonitor::end_window(label) function returns an AppleEnergyMetrics object containing energy data collected during the window. Note about Measurement Windows: You can have multiple windows active simultaneously (i.e., they can overlap), as long as each uses a distinct label. Non-overlapping windows can re-use names. I.e., once a window is ended with end_window , its label is free to be reused. Attempting to start a window with a label still currently in use (i.e., end_window not yet called for that label) will raise an exception. Calling end_window with a label that doesn't belong to any currently active window will raise an exception. Note about Results of Measurements: Results are reported via an AppleEnergyMetrics struct, but depending on your processor, some metrics may not be available (e.g., DRAM may not be available on older machines). In such cases, fields that could not be measured will be presented as: None in Python, and an empty std::optional object in C++. A more detailed explanation of results is provided later in this readme . Usage Examples The API is identical in C++ and Python. For available fields of a result object, read this section of the readme . C++ Example #include \"apple_energy.hpp\" int main () { // Create a monitor instance. AppleEnergyMonitor monitor ; // --- Basic Measurement --- monitor . begin_window ( \"task_1\" ); // Indicating the measurement window starts here. // Do some work... // End the window and get results. AppleEnergyMetrics result1 = monitor . end_window ( \"task_1\" ); // --- Overlapping Measurements --- monitor . begin_window ( \"outer_task\" ); monitor . begin_window ( \"inner_task\" ); AppleEnergyMetrics inner_result = monitor . end_window ( \"inner_task\" ); AppleEnergyMetrics outer_result = monitor . end_window ( \"outer_task\" ); // --- Reusing a Label --- monitor . begin_window ( \"task_1\" ); // This is okay because previous \"task_1\" window ended. AppleEnergyMetrics result = monitor . end_window ( \"task_1\" ); } Python Example from zeus_apple_silicon import AppleEnergyMonitor , AppleEnergyMetrics # Create a monitor instance. monitor = AppleEnergyMonitor () # --- Basic Measurement --- monitor . begin_window ( \"task_1\" ) # Indicating the measurement window starts here. # Do some work... # End the window and get results. result1 = monitor . end_window ( \"task_1\" ) # --- Overlapping Measurements --- monitor . begin_window ( \"outer_task\" ) monitor . begin_window ( \"inner_task\" ) inner_result = monitor . end_window ( \"inner_task\" ) outer_result = monitor . end_window ( \"outer_task\" ) # --- Reusing a Label --- monitor . begin_window ( \"task_1\" ) # This is okay because previous \"task_1\" ended. result = monitor . end_window ( \"task_1\" ) API Reference Class: AppleEnergyMonitor The main class for getting energy measurements. AppleEnergyMonitor() : Constructor. Initializes the monitoring system. begin_window(label: str) : Starts a new measurement window identified by label . end_window(label: str) -> AppleEnergyMetrics : Ends the measurement window identified by label and returns an object containing the results. get_cumulative_energy() -> AppleEnergyMetrics : Returns cumulative energy consumed from an unspecified point fixed over the lifetime of the energy monitor (e.g., from bootup). Struct/Class: AppleEnergyMetrics This struct/class is how results get reported, containing metrics for various different SoC subsystems. All energy values are reported in mJ. Note: on some hardware configurations or macOS versions, certain metrics might not be available or reportable by the underlying system. In such cases, the corresponding attribute will be: C++: An empty std::optional . You should check .has_value() before accessing .value() . Python: None . You should check for None before using the value. Fields Reported in AppleEnergyMetrics: CPU Related Metrics: cpu_total_mj : std::optional<int64_t> (C++) / Optional[int] (Python) Total energy consumed by all CPU related subsystems combined. efficiency_cores_mj : std::optional<std::vector<int64_t>> (C++) / Optional[list[int]] (Python) Energy consumed by each efficiency core individually. Returns a list where each element corresponds to an efficiency core. performance_cores_mj : std::optional<std::vector<int64_t>> (C++) / Optional[list[int]] (Python) Energy consumed by each performance core individually. Returns a list where each element corresponds to a performance core. efficiency_core_manager_mj : std::optional<int64_t> (C++) / Optional[int] (Python) Energy attributed to the efficiency core cluster's management logic. performance_core_manager_mj : std::optional<int64_t> (C++) / Optional[int] (Python) Energy attributed to the performance core cluster's management logic. DRAM Metrics: dram_mj : std::optional<int64_t> (C++) / Optional[int] (Python) Energy consumed by DRAM. GPU Related Metrics: gpu_mj : std::optional<int64_t> (C++) / Optional[int] (Python) Energy consumed by the on-chip GPU. gpu_sram_mj : std::optional<int64_t> (C++) / Optional[int] (Python) Energy consumed by the GPU's SRAM. ANE Metrics: ane_mj : std::optional<int64_t> (C++) / Optional[int] (Python) Energy consumed by the Apple Neural Engine (ANE).

The Jacksonville Jaguars were the first to make a splash, orchestrating a blockbuster trade to move into the No. 2 slot to add Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter . Meanwhile, quarterbacks were naturally a key storyline as well. Cam Ward going No. 1 overall to the Tennessee Titans didn't catch anyone off guard, but the rest that ensued at the position certainly did. Just one other quarterback heard his name called on Thursday night, and it wasn't the one most expected. Instead of Colorado signal-caller Shedeur Sanders, it was Ole Miss' Jaxson Dart , who was QB2 in this class, as the New York Giants moved back into the bottom half of the first round to punch his ticket to the Big Apple. And all that was the tip of the iceberg. With the dust settled, let's take a look at some of the biggest surprises from Day 1 of the draft. 1. Jaguars make blockbuster trade up for Travis Hunter Throughout the day on Thursday, reports telegraphed that Jacksonville was trying to make a big statement on Day 1 of the draft, and first-year GM James Gladstone certainly delivered. Initially sitting with the No. 5 overall pick, the Jaguars executed a blockbuster trade with the Cleveland Browns to move up to the No. 2 overall pick, where they selected Heisman Trophy winner and dual-threat weapon Travis Hunter. The wide receiver/corner hybrid is a rare talent who is arguably the top player at both positions in this class. While he's expected to play both ways in Jacksonville, it will be fascinating to see him pair up with 2024 first-round wideout Brian Thomas Jr . on offense. 2. Colston Loveland taken over Tyler Warren Throughout the pre-draft process, Penn State's Tyler Warren had been looked at as the top tight end in this class. Yes, some stumped for Michigan's Colston Loveland -- like our own Mike Renner -- as TE1, but Warren was the favorite on the betting markets to be the first player at his position drafted, while Loveland was in the +300 range to be the first tight end drafted as of Thursday morning. With the 10th overall pick, however, the Chicago Bears decided to bring Loveland aboard as the new tight end in Ben Johnson's offense over Warren. While he doesn't hold the title of TE1, the Nittany Lion didn't have to wait too long to hear his name called as the Indianapolis Colts scooped him up at No. 14 overall. 3. Shedeur Sanders falls out of the first round Given his wide draft range, it's hard to call Sanders falling out of the first round truly surprising. After all, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones did have Sanders falling out of the first round in his mock draft. That said, to see it actually happen was jarring. Sanders was CBS Sports' No. 2-ranked quarterback prospect, and despite being on the board for various QB-needy teams, he did not hear his name called on Day 1. Maybe the most surprising angle of Sanders' fall was the Pittsburgh Steelers passing on him at No. 21 overall. Even with reports noting Mike Tomlin's affinity for the player and the Steelers still in Aaron Rodgers purgatory, they went in a different direction, adding Oregon defensive tackle Derrick Harmon instead. Sanders' fall and where he'll ultimately end up will be the big story heading into Day 2. 4. Giants trade back into first to select Jaxson Dart Piggybacking off the Sanders story above, the Giants trading back into the first round for a quarterback was another surprising storyline. Not only was New York able to get back up to No. 25 overall in a trade with the Houston Texans , but they turned heads by forgoing the opportunity to select Sanders and instead went with Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart. The Giants didn't break the bank to trade up (No. 34, No. 99, and a 2026 third-round pick), but how Dart's career pans out compared to Sanders will be a storyline linked to the franchise for the foreseeable future. 5. Falcons trade future first to bring in James Pearce Jr. The Atlanta Falcons were busy on Thursday night. They initially enjoyed Georgia pass rusher Jalon Walker falling to them at No. 15 overall but didn't stop there when it came to adding help along the defensive line. Atlanta traded back into the first round to bring in another pass rusher, moving up to No. 26 to add edge rusher James Pearce Jr. out of Tennessee. And it cost them a pretty penny to do so. To acquire No. 26 (and No. 101), Atlanta shipped out No. 46 and No. 242 overall in this year's draft along with their first-rounder in 2025. While this further addresses a key need, it's expensive and more than what New York paid to move up just ahead of them with Houston, and that was for a quarterback.

Andrew White April 25, 2025 Share Young Thug has returned\u2014alongside frequent collaborator Future \u2014with their new single, \"Money on Money.\" The pair released the song on Friday after teasing its existence earlier this week. The video features the ATL super duo with tools in tow, surgically removing the doors from a visually expensive-looking car before joyriding around. It\u2019s possibly a nod to the Maybach-altering visuals in 2011\u2019s \u201cOtis\u201d by Ye (formerly Kanye West) and Jay-Z. Not long before the video was released, Lil Baby \u2014among others\u2014took to social media to support his fellow ATL rapper, sharing a message hyping the song's visual. \"@thuggerthugger1 dropping the video of the year tonight,\" Baby wrote on his Instagram Story. The track arrives shortly after Thug, who was released from custody last October following a guilty plea in the YSL RICO case , hinted that fans could expect a new album titled UY Scuti in the near future. The title takes its name from the supergiant star located roughly 9,500 lightyears from our planet. Thug's confirmation of the new album comes with perfect timing as this month also marks the 10th anniversary of Thug\u2019s long-revered Barter 6 tape. UY Scuti would mark Thug\u2019s first album since Business Is Business in 2023. \"It\u2019s time. Red Planet,\" Thug simply wrote on X (formerly Twitter), alongside a link to a website featuring the album for pre-order and various pieces of merch. For your viewing pleasure, the video for \"Money on Money\" is linked above, and the track is available for streaming on Apple Music and Spotify .

The landmark celebration highlights an incredible and idiosyncratic trajectory of growth and quality-led evolution that has shaped that of DO Rueda itself. More importantly, it tells the story of Cuatro Rayas\u2019 300 members and the 2,500ha they manage across the municipalities of Valladolid and Segovia; the story not merely of a winery but of a community that has navigated the last nine decades together, with common goals and shared challenges. Today, rather than growth, Cuatro Rayas has entered an important period of consolidation, building upon the cooperative\u2019s far-reaching sustainability strategy and homing in on the important resources \u2013 natural and human \u2013 it manages. Community at the core Among Cuatro Rayas\u2019 growers are the direct descendants of its founding members, who joined forces in 1935 as Bodega Cooperativa de La Seca to optimise resources and leverage their labour in the vineyard to produce higher-quality wines. Their pioneering, collaborative effort set the foundation for what Cuatro Rayas is today: a brand synonymous with expressive Verdejo and quality-led cooperation. What\u2019s more, the continuity of their initiative down the generations reveals the enduring relevance of this commitment to self- and mutual development. In 2023, with the help of Valladolid\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, Cuatro Rayas conducted a socioeconomic impact assessment; this report revealed that the cooperative directly and indirectly creates nearly 700 jobs, for a total economic impact of \u20ac33.3 million (\u00a328.5 million) per year. This affirms Cuatro Rayas as one of the most important agents of social and economic resilience in the region, as well as a leading custodian of its cultural heritage. The 90th anniversary celebration is therefore also a recognition of the privilege and responsibility these numbers bring. Among Cuatro Rayas\u2019 growers are the direct descendants of its founding members. Quality, research and precision Led by winemaking director Elena M Oyagu\u0308e and winemaker Roberto L Tello, the team has developed a rigorous winemaking programme that delivers quality and consistency at scale, doing justice to the work of the cooperative\u2019s members. Seeking increasing character and expressiveness, the team is doing careful soil and vineyard studies that inform more precise vinifications \u2013 which will be supported by the inaugural harvest at Cuatro Rayas\u2019 new, state-of-the-art winery. Ultimately, it is the commitment of the growers and the character of their vineyards that Oyagu\u0308e and Tello are tasked with capturing. The heritage of Cuatro Rayas\u2019 membership means that the quality and diversity of its portfolio of vineyards is second to none in DO Rueda. It includes some of the region\u2019s oldest, not least ungrafted plots that survived phylloxera. These provide important raw material for the winery\u2019s Gran Vino de Rueda (GVR) labels, flagship Verdejos that reflect the full potential of the Rueda\u2019s iconic grape, as well as Cuatro Rayas\u2019 commitment to quality. The creation of the Gran Vino category in 2020 merely validated the work already being developed, at the crossroads of tradition and innovation, by Cuatro Rayas\u2019 members and team. As the cooperative enters its tenth decade, its history serves as the blueprint for the future: working together, for the benefit of all. Winemaking director Elena M Oyag\u00fce with winemaker Roberto L Tello. Cuatro Rayas\u2019 flagship Verdejos Vin\u0303edos Centenarios 2024 91pts As the name suggests, this Verdejo hails from old vineyards, aged 80-100 years. 15% of the juice ferments in French oak barriques, with the remainder vinified in stainless steel; all with four months ageing on the lees. Subtly nutty and unctuous, this is poised and moreish, with peach, melon and Nashi pear at the core, lined with a fragrant layer of hay, lemon balm and rose petals. Alc 13.5% Cuarenta Vendimias Cuve\u0301e GVR 2023 92pts A structured, characterful blend with different components fermented in stainless steel, foudres and barriques. Deep and textured with toffee, fresh walnuts and chopped almonds over yellow apple and lemon curd; pleasant volume and weight on the mid-palate and a long finish of salted caramel. Alc 12.5% Longverdejo GVR 2023 93pts The product of a research partnership with the University of Leo\u0301n, this wine is fermented with a yeast selected from traditional cellars in Rueda. The fruit hails from old bush-trained vines. Hand- harvested and fermented in stainless steel, concrete eggs and barriques. Very complete and balanced, with lemon zest and pear peel mingling with red apple, melon and quince. Silky, but with grippy pull and a beautiful, flinty edge, and a long finish of lingering fennel and olive brine. Alc 12.5% Amador Diez GVR 2021 93pts Grapes hand-harvested from 10ha of pre-phylloxera vines were fermented and aged for seven months on the lees in French oak barriques. The result is an intense and unctuous wine, with great ageing potential. The wood is superbly integrated, supporting the melon, nectarine and papaya fruit, with subtle nuttiness beneath a top layer of honeyed almonds and wildflower honey and a spicy veil of white pepper and aniseed. Alc 13.5% Cuatro Rayas\u2019 vineyards include some of Rueda\u2019s oldest, not least ungrafted plots that survived phylloxera.

I think I might have been working during a peak for \u201cdesign thinking\u201d. Organisations like IDEO and Apple helped to establish design as the differentiating factor between successful organisations and the rest . But, in recent years I\u2019ve seen a shift. The faith placed in \u201cdesign thinking\u201d now seems diverted into \u201cproduct thinking.\u201d From my view, I can see how this happened. From the birth of the double diamond in 2004 through to the rise of Google Venture\u2019s Design Sprint method , I see \u201cdesign\u201d peak around 2017. \u201cDesign thinking\u201d felt like a bit of a cult back then. Google Trends backs up my biased and personal perspective. \u201cDesign Thinking\u201d overtakes \u201cproduct management\u201d around 2016 \u2014 the year Jake Knapp publishes and popularises the Google 5-day Sprint Methodology. Maybe, for a brief while, \u201cdesign\u201d feels like the way you solve problems for customers and users. But then interest swings back to product management. A Google Trends chart for \u201cdesign thinking\u201d and \u201cproduct management\u201d since 2004 I don\u2019t want to pin this all on the 5-day sprint. But design process became linked to creating value by boosting growth for quick returns, particularly in start-up contexts. This narrowed the scope and missed some of the point and purpose of design . Maybe UX Bootcamps that taught design thinking over a week or two also contributed. The \u201cmarket\u201d simplified design thinking to the bare minimum to satisfy demand. It also applied a specific method too broadly. If IDEO and \u201cdesign thinking\u201d was on the extreme of \u201cbig design,\u201d the 5-day sprint, due to its speed, narrowed the spectrum. And this reduced palette proliferated. People applied design sprints to problems they weren\u2019t well-suited to solve. Then that process got chipped away at . Covid and remote working further mutated process, particularly facilitation. We seemed to sleepwalk into a situation where \u201cdesign thinking\u201d became a set of sentences that start with the phrase \u201cHow might we\u2026\u201d and a session of Crazy 8s. That\u2019s not design. If you\u2019re always \u201cthinking fast,\u201d you\u2019re missing out on a whole type of thinking ( thinking slow?) \u2026 It\u2019s also no wonder that when you adopt only a move fast mindset, you sometimes break things. [In the words of \u201cproduct thinking\u201d you don\u2019t effectively manage your risks ]. Sense-making and difference-making I worry that the people working on digital products and services are particularly prone to cults. We like to worship founders. We like trends. I worry that the cult of \u201cdesign thinking\u201d has been replaced with a cult of \u201cproduct\u201d and that we\u2019re in danger of losing energy and talent in the displine of UX design. When a single perspective dominates a narrative, it tends to narrow possibilities. \u201cDesign thinking\u201d and \u201cProduct thinking\u201d needn\u2019t be competing schools of thought in a zero sum game. But I think we might need to get better at understanding and describing the value of design in the context of \u201cproduct organisations\u201d and operating models. Otherwise we might find ourselves reduced to a sort of \u20185-day design.\u2019 And by misunderstanding \u201cdesign\u201d we might end up executing deduced solutions, rather than really innovating. This dilutes \u201cproduct thinking\u201d as much as design. Product managers might develop a sort of thinned view of design as only execution . Even experienced \u201cproduct people\u201d like Marty Cagan seem surprised when they begin to fully consider and appreciate h ow skilled designers think and work . I think design thinking and product thinking are similar. Both seek to understand needs and then meet them. Both rely on deep understanding of a user/customer/audience. Both use data \u2014 whether quantitive or qualitative to generate understanding. And both then form hypotheses and devise experiments to solve a problem or generate value. But, I think the unique value between the disciplines differs, subtly. In my experience, design is better at \u201cdifference making\u201d. In the beautifully clear sentence of Anna White, design combines \u201cdesigning the right thing, and designing the thing right\u201d . That is equally true of product thinking. Product management and product thinking is exceptional at deciding on \u201cthe right thing.\u201d Designers design the thing right. But while both disciplines can do both. And in technical contexts, engineers might lead solution identification and generation. The true value of design in product organisations isn\u2019t in the sensemaking elements of design thinking. It\u2019s in the generation and translation of ideas \u2014 describing how to make a difference . Marty Cagan describes the difference between product teams and feature teams. Feature teams build what they\u2019re told. Empowered product teams are given problems to solve and risks to manage. But the best product teams are creative. They know the right risks. But alongside the risks in the landscape, they can populate it with more of the right type of problems and more possible solutions. If you want to compete in a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world, you need a mature design capability, working alongside skilled product managers to blend three types of thinking. Deduction is the first. It happens when we logically move from the general to the specific. It generates certainty and facts. It\u2019s great for priorisation and drawing conclusions in information-rich environments. Induction is the second type of thinking. It does something similar with less data. It generates a prediction rather than the more solid conclusion of deduction. Induction allows us to build theories from data. Deduction allows us to validate them. But this thinking makes sense of what is already in the system. To create innovation and gain a competitive edge, you need skilled people who can think in a third way: abduction . Abduction isn\u2019t about kidnapping your competitors. Abduction generates new ideas. I previously defined design as \u201cthe translation of intent into experiments designed to generate value.\u201d But that too could be describing product management. The true value of design is how it can generate new \u201clanguage\u201d to aid that translation. It can do this through process and facilitation to blend the \u201cdialects\u201d of different disciplines. But the true value of design is the creative generation of new \u201cwords\u201d and \u201cphrases.\u201d Design generates the language of innovation. It moves away from what we know to find new possibilities, moving from deducted certainties, or inducted predictions to abducted possibilities \u2013 and because design is a structured process for managing ideas, it tests and de-risks along the way. Design allows us manipulate constraints to create new value out of existing resources. Or it can help someone with an idea but no language to describe it find a way to turn the thoughts in their head into tangible expressions. Tangible ideas can then be shared with colleagues or users at different levels of fidelity. That\u2019s the value of design when paired with \u201cproduct thinking\u201d. Design makes new things. Marty Cagan says that ideas can come from anywhere \u2014 customers, data, sales teams, technology trends, competitors. And he stresses that effective product thinking isn\u2019t about where the idea comes from , but rather about how thoroughly they\u2019re validated before becoming built feature. But, you definitely need ideas. And you need the skills to manage and communicate them \u2014 blending deduction, induction and abduction. The most effective form of creation and validation will blend the three types of thinking I\u2019ve described. And successful organisations need to be able to do all three because the risks and rewards we see from the different styles of thinking differ. Creativity creates. Design isn\u2019t just ideation. But if you\u2019re an organisation that doesn\u2019t understand or value design, you might find yourself reduced to deduction and induction. Your \u201ccontinuous discovery\u201d might be reduced to incremental improvements and aping the competition. And you might end up just following trends, rather than setting them. If you don\u2019t have competency in different thinking styles or if the order of your thinking is limited to \u2018decide, analyse, create\u2019 \u2014 you can only deal with certain situations \u2013 cynefin taught us that . Effective organisations can switch that sequence depending on their context. We need the greatest number of good ideas \u2013 and the right forms of validation to test them. Partnering and pairing design thinking with product thinking expands the range of possibilities open to organisations. Maybe I\u2019ve got nostalgic for 2018, when design thinking was \u2018on trend\u2019. But I do think a dominant narrative can sometimes narrow debate and therefore reduce practice and the possibilities that we see. So, even if we are living in the age of \u201cproduct thinking\u201d dominance, I still think there\u2019s a specific and valuable role for design.

The extremely simple, refreshingly small truck is designed to be a blank slate for owners to easily customize how they want \u2014 hence the Slate name \u2014 with a wide variety of more than 100 accessories available at launch . You'll even be able to transform the two-seat truck into a five-seat SUV, and the rear-wheel-drive Slate will have a range of up to 240 miles. Slate says the truck will proudly be made in the U.S. \"as part of a commitment to re-industrializing America,\" and it'll cost less than $20,000 with federal incentives factored in when it starts production late next year. There's still a lot we don't know about Slate, like exactly where the truck will be built and what other corporations it has partnered with. But if the company is able to pull this thing off, it could really make a difference in the American market \u2014 not just in terms of EV adoption, but for the industry as a whole. Alright, there's a lot to cover here, so let's dive in. Lightweight and efficient Slate Auto I'll get the powertrain specs out of the way first. You can choose from a 52.7-kWh battery pack that offers 150 miles of range or an 84.3-kWh pack that aims to get 240 miles of range. Regardless of battery size, the Slate has a single electric motor putting out 201 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque to the rear axle, with a MacPherson strut front suspension and De Dion rear axle with coil springs. It'll have a 0-to-60-mph time of 8 seconds and a top speed of 90 mph. The Slate will be able to tow 1,000 pounds, and it'll have a 1,433-pound payload. There's an NACS charge port on the driver's side rear fender, with DC fast charging of up to 120 kW that can get you from 20 to 80% in half an hour, or a full charge in 4-8 hours with the 11-kW AC charger. Slate quotes a curb weight of 3,602 pounds, which is about the same as a Ford Maverick. It will have traction control and electronic stability control, and while ABS isn't mentioned on the spec sheet I'm sure it's included. Slate says it's aiming for (and currently meeting or exceeding in testing) a five-star NCAP safety rating, and to that end it has automated emergency braking, forward collision warning with pedestrian detection, and up to 8 airbags. It's smaller than a Civic Slate Auto At 174.6 inches long the two-door Slate truck is more than two feet shorter than a Ford Maverick and almost five inches shorter than a Honda Civic Hatchback ; Slate makes the comparison that it's sized closely to a 1985 Toyota pickup . The Slate is 69.3 inches high, a bit taller than a Maverick, and its 5-foot bed is half a foot longer than the Ford. This is the tiny truck y'all have been begging automakers to build. Slate wanted the design to tug at your heart and be desirable for everyone, plus have the truck be easy to drive and get in and out of. Despite the Slate's diminutive size, it can fit a lot of stuff. There's a drainable frunk that fits 7 cubic feet worth of stuff, with the hood extending to part of the nose to give you a better opening, and the bed has 35.1 cubic feet of volume, with a width between the wheel wells of 42.9 inches and a max width of 54.9 inches. While I wish the truck had a lot more character and flair to its design \u2014imagine if the French had designed something with the Slate's size and other parameters \u2014 there's enough detail in its simple styling to make it interesting, like the flared fenders and chamfered surfaces. The round headlights and plastic bumper give it a cute face, and I like how squared-off and upright it is. A rear window that flips open is a nice touch. The shoulders are strong, the overhangs are short. It's just a great-looking 'lil truck. And the possibilities for customization help add some of that character I'm wanting. There's just one spec, and it's purposefully easy to wrap Slate Auto If you want your Slate to come in anything but plain gray, you'll have to do it yourself. The company says it's the first new vehicle that is designed to be wrapped \u2014 vinyl wrap kits already cut will be available from the factory, and the truck's cutlines make it easy to apply the wrap without taking off body panels. Slate will even wrap it for you, and it'll take mere hours. There will be partial wraps too, from doing just the roof or rear end to cool two-tones that look like trucks from the 1970s. Slate has all sorts of decal and stripe sets, too, and it says the wrap kits will start at around $500. The accessories extend to body parts and other components as well, with more than a hundred Slate Attach points throughout the car. There's gear racks, a spare tire carrier, beefier bumpers, fender flares, upgraded headlights and taillights, different grille designs, running boards, and all sorts of other stuff. Slate will even offer a 2.0-inch lift kit and a 1.0-inch lowering kit, and a few different 17-inch (standard) or 20-inch wheels with either road or all-terrain tires \u2014 plus decals to make the wheels look even cooler. If it's all too much for you to decide on by yourself, Slate already has over two dozen \"Starter Packs\" to choose from that bundle together all sorts of accessories, like the one pictured above. You'll be able to buy accessories individually or in bundles, and either at time of purchase or later. You can turn it into an SUV Slate Auto Though the Slate leaves the factory in a singular body style, it doesn't have to stay that way. Slate will offer a flat-pack accessory kit that turns the truck into a five-seat SUV, complete with a roll cage, more airbags and a bench seat. (No word on if the seats can be added to the truck bed Subaru BRAT\u2013style.) There are two different SUV rear ends to choose from, a traditional squared-off tailgate or a slanted fastback one. You can also choose to drive the Slate without doors on no matter which body style is on. Now, Slate doesn't say how easily this can be done, but given the truck's design I doubt it'll be that bad. The company does say there's no mechanics certification required. For both the SUV transformation and all the other accessories, there will be a Slate U platform (I'm assuming an app) with step-by-step video tutorials to show you how to put everything together. With electric cars requiring much less maintenance than internal combustion cars, the Slate will let you get your wrenching fix in. There's no infotainment screen Slate Auto The interior is where I think the Slate gets a little too simple. Don't get me wrong, the rectangular design is great, with a flat dashboard that opens into a huge glovebox and an overall look reminiscent of the really cool stuff IKEA made back in the middle of last century, just with a lot less color. The door panels have cool fabric armrests, and the air vents, steering wheel, climate controls and column stalks have a great '80s vibe. You'll be able to buy all sorts of interior accessories too, like decal kits, different metal or wood accents, and other colors for the interior panels and seat covers. There are also things called Slatelets, cute little badges that clip onto the air vent that runs across the dash. As you'll notice, there's a small display in front of the driver, but no infotainment screen at all. Slate is instead making you get a phone or tablet mount and using your preferred tech. Problem is, you can't just get Apple CarPlay or Android Auto as an app on your phone, so either you're just driving with maps up the whole time, or you're swiping through your actual phone to change the song or respond to a text. There will be a Slate app that works as an infotainment system and is how the car gets over-the-air updates, but again, you've gotta interact with your phone on the dash. It also doesn't come with speakers as standard, offering them as accessories or giving you a mount for your own Bluetooth speaker. A set of Bluetooth controls for the steering wheel and an extra row of auxiliary buttons are found in the accessory catalog, as are a center console with an armrest, door pockets, power windows \u2014 it's got cranks as standard . You can order one now, and deliveries start next year Slate Auto Already building and testing prototypes, and a factory in Indiana is tooling up now in anticipation of trucks reaching the first customers in Q4 of 2026. The trucks will be bought online in a direct-to-consumer model, but the company will have a nationwide lineup of service centers and places that can help with all the accessories. Exact price hasn't been announced yet, but Slate says it will start at under $20,000 with incentives included, which means it'll carry an MSRP of less than $27,500. I have a feeling there will be a lot of sticker shock when accessories get piled on, especially when you'll need to add a lot to get the Slate feeling like it's a car from 2026 with features competitive to a Nissan Versa. The Slate is available to reserve right now for $50; the company says the earlier you reserve one the earlier you'll get one, and the deposit is \"refundable if you chicken out.\" Slate's website is pretty excellent , and there's already a fantastic configurator that will let you go through every single accessory that'll be on offer at launch.

Previously limited to Android, Perplexity's voice assistant wants users to turn to it before the native option. Further, there are a few good reasons why iPhone owners might be inclined to do so. Basically, it's more proactive and able to go a few extra steps beyond Siri's abilities. Ask it to find a dinner reservation, and it will dive into the OpenTable app to fill in your reservation requests, including guests, date, and time, without you having to say another word, just leaving the final tap on the Book button. The same goes for hunting for moments in YouTube videos. You can describe the climactic win from a niche sports documentary, see it queued up on YouTube right away. You may like What is Perplexity: Take your pick of AI models What is Apple Siri: This chatbot virtual assistant has finally come of age Of course, some of what Perplexity can do are things that Siri already handles, like writing emails and setting up calendar events. But, even with Apple Intelligence helping out, Perplexity is better at understanding more casual language. And that's before considering the more proactive approach. Ask Siri about signing up for an event this weekend, and you'll hear the familiar \u201cHere's what I found on the web.\u201d Do the same with Perplexity's voice assistant, and (depending on the circumstances) the AI might say, \u201cI already filled out the form. Just click send.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s not all-powerful. You need to open the app and tap the microphone icon to start talking to the AI. However, the responses often let you refine your request without having to start over from scratch. Additionally, the iOS version of Perplexity\u2019s assistant has a few notable limitations. It can\u2019t set alarms or control core iPhone functions, including muting notifications or taking photos. It also can\u2019t access your camera to \u201csee what you see,\u201d which other AI assistants like ChatGPT \u2019s voice mode can.

This \u201cagentic AI\u201d approach is gaining popularity across various AI services, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, which are both experimenting with similar ideas. The aim is to cross the bridge from traditional voice AI to fully independent digital agents. Right now, it won\u2019t book the reservation unless you make your final click. But that might change in a year or two. Apple isn't ignoring this concept, but has been slow off the mark in some ways. Although Siri's intelligence has been upgraded in recent months, we are still awaiting the full generative AI overhaul that was originally promised to launch this year within a future version of iOS 18. Apple has since delayed the AI-infused Siri and said it will arrive at some point in the future, more specifically, \"in the coming year.\" Still, by opening its voice assistant to iOS users and layering in real-world tools like OpenTable and YouTube, Perplexity is carving out a space as a nimble alternative to native AI assistants. And if you just want to say, \u201cFind me tacos and make the reservation,\u201d and have the bot say, \u201cDone,\" Perplexity's voice assistant might be your new favorite iPhone aide.

Is it really listening to users through their smartphone microphones? Or is the truth much more unsettling? Depositphotos View gallery - 3 images Perhaps one of the most pervasive longstanding technology conspiracy theories is that your smartphone is constantly listening in on your private conversations. Almost everyone at some point has felt the eerie synchronicity of seeing an ad served up on a social media platform that exactly corresponds to a recent conversation. It\u2019s certainly unnerving, and the most simple explanation is one of direct surveillance. Of course Facebook, Google and Apple are all listening in on your private conversations with friends, catching key words, and then serving you tailored advertisements. And of course they would deny this is happening. The problem is, outside of anecdotal cases, no one has ever been able to find clear evidence that this is actually happening. Editor's note: Readers often ask us for follow-ups on memorable stories. What has happened to this story over the years? This article was originally published in 2019 but it has been re-edited and updated with new information current as of April 15, 2025. Enjoy! In 2024 a big news story emerged purporting to finally offer the smoking gun evidence proving once and for all that private conversations are tracked by smartphones to tailor ads to individual users. Investigative news site 404 Media revealed the massive media conglomerate Cox Media Group (CMG) had developed a system it called Active Listening. The system could apparently capture what it called \"real-time intent data\" using a smart device's microphone. This \"voice data\" could then be paired with AI processes and other \"behavioral data\" to serve up highly targeted advertisements. Exactly how this Active Listening system actually worked was unclear but almost immediately every major tech company distanced itself from CMG. Amazon claimed to have never worked with CMG as an ad partner, while Google and Meta swiftly severed any ties with the company. Even CMG went into damage control mode stating the Active Listening product had been \"discontinued to avoid misperception.\" As far as anyone could understand, the proposed CMG system wasn't listening through a phone's microphone 24/7, instead it was using those small slivers of voice data that are recorded and uploaded to the cloud in the moments after you activate your voice assistant with a \"Hey Google\" or \"Hey Siri\" command. While the revelation certainly rekindled the \"my smartphone is listening to me all the time\" conspiracy, it didn't debunk some of the basic reasons why this idea is still technically untenable. And to understand this we need to go back a few years. In 2019 Mobile cybersecurity company Wandera conducted a series of experiments to understand how your smartphone could be consistently listening in to your private conversations. These experiments busted the urban myth but also pointed to a the truth about how companies like Facebook sometimes serve up such disturbingly accurate advertisements that is much more complex, and unsettling. Facebook admits listening to private conversations In early August 2019, Bloomberg News published a story revealing how Facebook had contracted an external company to transcribe audio conversations conducted through the Facebook Messenger app. The process was engaged to test the accuracy of an automatic transcription algorithm Facebook was rolling out, and the company claimed all users who opted in to the transcription service were aware of the potential human review system. While some reports questioned how transparent Facebook\u2019s notification process actually was, the story rapidly spread across media outlets, with a vast array of headlines dramatically affirming \u201c Facebook admits it was listening to your private conversations. \u201d To the average headline skimmer, whose primary knowledge of news comes from glancing across headlines that pop up in social media streams, this was enough to reanimate years of conspiratorial assumptions. The news story was akin to throwing gasoline on the burning embers of a myth that had almost been extinguished. Even the media outlet that broke the original story made a somewhat disingenuous link between the old microphone-ad conspiracy and this new revelation, referencing Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony to US congress in April 2018 as if presenting a \"gotcha\" moment of catching him lying. Responding to Senator Gary Peters, who questioned whether Facebook listened in on user\u2019s microphones to generate targeted ads, Zuckerberg replied, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about this conspiracy theory that gets passed around that we listen to what\u2019s going on on your microphone and use that for ads. We don\u2019t do that.\u201d In fact, Facebook had been denying for years that it listens to user conversations to generate targeted ads. Way back in mid-2016 the company first tried to debunk that conspiracy theory . \u201cFacebook does not use your phone\u2019s microphone to inform ads or to change what you see in News Feed. Some recent articles have suggested that we must be listening to people\u2019s conversations in order to show them relevant ads. This is not true. We show ads based on people\u2019s interests and other profile information \u2013 not what you\u2019re talking out loud about.\u201d The data doesn't add up So in 2019 Wandera, a mobile cyber-security company, set out to test the \u201cphone-snooping\u201d theory, saying its customers seemed constantly worried about the issue. Wandera's experiment was pretty simple . Place an iPhone and a Samsung Galaxy in a room, then play an audio loop of pet food ads for 30 minutes a day, over three days. User permissions for a large number of apps were all enabled, and the same experiment was performed, with the same phones, in a silent test room to act as a control. The experiment had two main goals. First, a number of apps were scanned following the experiment to ascertain whether pet food ads suddenly appeared in any streams. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the devices were closely examined to track data consumption, battery use, and background activity. The results will probably surprise no one. No pet food advertisements showed up on any app following the test. Even more telling, there was virtually no difference in data consumption, battery use, and background activity between the audio room tests and the silent room tests. This fact is important, because if an app were accessing a microphone and sending the audio to a cloud server for analysis there would be detectable traces of data consumption. Android data consumption over 30 minutes compared to the volume of data the Google Voice Assistant uses across the same time period Wandera \u201cWe observed that the data from our tests is much lower than the virtual assistant data over the 30-minute time period, which suggests that the constant recording of conversations and uploading to the cloud is not happening on any of these tested apps,\u201d said James Mack, a Wandera engineer working on the test. \u201cIf it was, we\u2019d expect data usage to be as high as the virtual assistants\u2019 data consumption.\u201d iOS data consumption over 30 minutes compared to the volume of data Siri uses across the same time period Wandera The lack of evidence of any data consumption in these tests is probably the most significant smoking gun debunking the longstanding myth. Antonio Garcia-Martinez, an ex-Facebook product manager, has been vocally critical of the company for several years after leaving it in 2013. However, in 2017 he penned an incredibly succinct editorial for Wired summing up why Facebook isn\u2019t listening to you through your smartphone microphone. Like Wandera, Garcia-Martinez suggested the level of data consumption needed for microphone surveillance would make the technique not only difficult to execute, but also virtually impossible to hide. \"To make it happen, Facebook would need to record everything your phone hears while it's on,\u201d Garcia-Martinez explained in 2017 . \u201cThis is functionally equivalent to an always-on phone call from you to Facebook. Your average voice-over-internet call takes something like 24 kbps one way, which amounts to about 3 kBs of data per second. Assume you've got your phone on half the day, that's about 130 MBs per day, per user. There are around 150 million daily active users in the US, so that's about 20 petabytes per day, just in the US. To put that in perspective, Facebook's entire data storage is 'only' about 300 petabytes, with a daily ingestion rate of about 600 terabytes.\u201d Some counter that argument by suggesting Facebook can simply scan audio for keywords coming into the microphone on a device. This means it wouldn\u2019t need to constantly stream an open audio channel from your microphone into the cloud. But Garcia-Martinez also pushes back on that idea, suggesting not only does Facebook have millions of targeted ad keywords it would need to track, but the strain on your phone\u2019s CPU would be immediately noticeable \u2013 and again, nearly impossible to hide. \"Then we started seeing things we didn't expect\" In early 2017 Jingjing Ren, a PhD student at Northeastern University, and Elleen Pan, an undergraduate student, designed a study to investigate the very issue of whether phones listen in on conversations without users knowing. Pretty quickly it became clear to the researchers that the phones' microphones were not being covertly activated, but it also became clear there were a number of other disconcerting things going on. \u201cThere were no audio leaks at all \u2013 not a single app activated the microphone,\u201d said Christo Wilson , a computer scientist working on the project. \u201cThen we started seeing things we didn\u2019t expect. Apps were automatically taking screenshots of themselves and sending them to third parties. In one case, the app took video of the screen activity and sent that information to a third party.\u201d Out of over 17,000 Android apps examined, more than 9,000 had potential permissions to take screenshots. And a number of apps were found to actively be doing so, taking screenshots and sending them to third-party sources. \u201cThat has the potential to be much worse than having the camera taking pictures of the ceiling or the microphone recording pointless conversations,\u201d said David Choffnes, another computer scientists working on the project. \u201cThere is no easy way to close this privacy opening.\u201d So, your phone may not be listening in to your conversations, but it has the capacity to track you in so many other ways. And it's through this massive trove of trackable data that companies like Facebook and Google are able to serve you targeted ads that occasionally seem frighteningly accurate. \u201cEverything that makes your phone useful, like knowing where you are, taking photos, enabling online shopping and banking \u2013 these are exactly where the potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities are,\u201d said Mike Campin, VP of engineering at Wandera. \u201cThe more useful your phone is, the more attractive it is to advertisers, hackers, or anyone who wants your data.\u201d And it is here where the truth behind your smartphone's occasionally unsettlingly targeted ads becomes much more creepy than any microphone surveillance conspiracy theory. The harsh truth \u201cThe harsh truth is that Facebook doesn\u2019t need to perform technical miracles to target you via weak signals. It\u2019s got much better ways to do so already,\u201d Garcia-Martinez wrote . \u201cNot every spookily accurate ad you see is a pure figment of your cognitive biases. Remember, Facebook can find you on whatever device you\u2019ve ever checked Facebook on. It can exploit everything that retailers know about you, and even sometimes track your in-store, cash-only purchases; that loyalty discount card is tied to a phone number or email for a reason.\u201d So you may adamantly claim Facebook must have listened in on your private conversation yesterday about a friend\u2019s wedding and then served you an ad for tailored wedding suits because you have not googled anything wedding-related in years. But there are scores of other data points the system has on you to determine what you should see at any given point. Not only does the system know exactly where you are at every moment, it knows who your friends are, what they are interested in, and who you are spending time with. It can track you across all your devices, log call and text metadata on Android phones, and even watch you write something that you end up deleting and never actually send. The deeply disconcerting implication of all this is that the rich vein of data constantly being gathered can be crunched by an algorithm to essentially predict what you and your friends are talking about, and serve you an ad that is perfectly tailored to your current needs. Even though these ad algorithms are not nearly perfect (try to pay attention to how often you are served ads that are entirely irrelevant to your interests), the simple fact that they are so eerily correct even some of the time is the real conspiracy here. With the advent of voice-controlled smart devices you are certainly being listened to almost all of the time in a way. But understanding exactly how these devices work is key to understanding why they couldn't be recording you all the time. A voice-controlled device switches on for a moment once it locally detects a key command (such as \"Hey Google\"). It then records the next few seconds of voice data, quickly uploads it to the cloud, processes a response, and sends the end result to your device. All this data transference can be detected and tracked. We know it is happening. We can see it. On the other hand, it is almost impossible for a human mind to understand how these complex algorithms tracking scores of data points about you and your movements actually work. How they crunch vast volumes of personal data to decide now is the right time to serve up an ad for fried chicken is possibly beyond the comprehension of even the engineers designing the algorithms. In many ways, it makes sense so many people still believe in the microphone conspiracy. It is so much easier to understand how Facebook served you up that prescient ad if we imagine it simply overheard the conversation you had yesterday with friends. But as with many things in life, the truth happens to be much more complicated, much more inscrutable, and much more disturbing. An earlier version of this article was published in 2019.

Rick O April 25, 2025 05:07 AM I'm fairly sure they listen constantly. I've had conversations about things that I've never searched for, and then see ads on Facebook about it. It is topics that another person brings up, that I don't even think about. I think they have a way to do it locally, without pushing data until you open the app. Also, they have phone permissions, and I know for sure they use that when you're on a call. My ex's husband called me about something regarding the kids, and brought up something unrelated about his Raptor. I don't like Fords, never research them, never talk about them. The very next time I opened Facebook, I had multiple ads for Ford trucks. I'm sorry, but that's just too much of a coincidence for me. I'm not going to stop using these things, but to say they aren't doing it is completely dishonest on their part. Bob B April 25, 2025 06:39 AM I'm with the tin foil hat crowd. I have all the Google assistant and AI stuff disabled on my phone (as much as possible, anyway), but it doesn't matter. In one instance, my friends and I got into a discussion about the awful blizzards of 78-79 and sure enough, the next time I visited YouTube I was recommended videos about it. I'm not a weather geek and never searched for that topic on any computer. They can claim your phone doesn't listen to you all they want - I'll never believe them. Ed Clark April 25, 2025 07:58 AM Wow! Our mobile apps taking screenshots explains everything. And you're right, that's more scary in many ways than the \"listening\" theory, since screenshots can also capture your \"private\" browsing sessions. Now the question becomes, which apps have those screenshot rights on our phones? Thanks for this article. White Rabbit April 25, 2025 08:53 AM Get a grip! If your phone isn't listening, how does it know you said \"Hey Google\"? Of course it's listening. How else could the search engine so frequently \"know\" what topic you want to research. The baseline for comparison in the charts is \"the volume of data the Google Voice Assistant uses.\" 60 MB can store over 30 minutes of sound in MP3 format - more with the lower bit rate required for voice. Obviously, voice can be transcribed and key words can be identified since it happens when you talk to the search engine. Since text uses MUCH less memory than sound, storing the key words takes a few BYTES of memory space - not MB, not even KB, 1 byte per character. So the fact that sound data isn't sent to any of the cited apps in real time doesn't mean it can't be processed, filtered, stored, and sent later as text when the app is opened. Cookies have been around since the beginning of the web. Google's main income stream is from selling data. One would expect that small packages of key words would not only take less bandwidth, time, and money to send, but would also be worth a lot more to the buyer! So the claim that \"nobody is listening to your phone calls\" is probably true, but perhaps only because what they get is text and it's not received at the same time that it occurs. I'm not claiming that this IS happening. I'm suggesting that if a retired CS prof can imagine such a system, surely the whiz kids of the industry are laughing at it as being old-school and old news. If they haven't thought of it and \"improved\" it yet, we're in a lot of trouble, folks. TechGazer April 25, 2025 09:00 AM This makes me wonder about other people's habits, because I've never bought anything from an online ad, and don't really notice them. To me they're an annoyance, rather than information. Pushy ads are more likely to make me not want to buy that product (and support the advertisers). Karmudjun April 25, 2025 11:19 AM Thanks Rich, you have reinforced the malevolent nature of our privacy controls. No they are not listening in, big brother isn't crunching everything, and we are not targeted across devices 24/7. But each time we use an app, we give a little bit of our privacy away never to be secured again. I don't google disposable diapers, yet I get ads for disposable diapers. I google \"hot babes\" without clicking on one website (well maybe just one or two) and get ads for ballpark franks. Of course I also go to the ballpark, so perhaps they have some sixth sense there. I also order MLB tickets via app. If they were coordinating things, I'd get escort service ads the next time I'm in DC or NYC. But I'm not holding my breath - the random ads for successful males in my area are targeted enough to worry me.

Jaxson Dart is headed to the NFL. Dart\u2019s draft stock is one of the most fascinating stories of the entire 2025 NFL Draft season. If you look at his trendline on NFL Mock Draft Database , Dart was a fringe Day Three selection as recently as early January. Since then, he has rocketed up draft boards, and in the hours ahead of the first round many mock drafts had him as the second QB off the board. For example, both Daniel Jeremiah and Dane Brugler had Dart as QB2 in their final mock drafts. Now, those predictions have proven to be correct, as the New York Giants traded back into the first round to take Daft with the No. 25 pick. New York executed a trade with the Houston Texans, sending Houston a 2025 second-round pick (No. 34), a 2025 third-round pick (No. 99) and a 2026 third-round pick for Houston\u2019s pick at No. 25. And the rights to draft Dart. Here is what Dart does well, and where he will need to improve to live up the expectations. A QB who will take the punch Many traits enter into a quarterback evaluation. Arm talent, accuracy, footwork, decision-making, and athleticism are all featured prominently on scouting reports. Questions such as character and leadership often figure into the equation. Then there is a trait that often simmers below the surface, but in many ways, there is no substitute for it. The willingness to stand in the pocket, accept that a human being much bigger, stronger, and faster than you is about to yeet you into the shadow realm, and still stand in the face of that threat to make a throw. Quarterback is a position with so many complexities, which makes grading the position one of the hardest things to do in the evaluation space. Beyond what traits matter, there is the factor of how those traits are weighed in the evaluation. If a quarterback does not have an elite-level arm, can they make up for that through decision-making and processing speed? If they lack elite athleticism, can they balance that out with arm talent? But there is no substitute for being willing to stand in the pocket knowing pain is coming your way. It is perhaps the most unnatural trait in sports, up there with climbing into the boxing ring or diving into the corner at Indianapolis Motor Speedway at 245 miles per hour with a wall in front of you. Every natural human thought in your brain tells you to run. To flee. The flight response kicks in. But will you, instead, fight? Often when studying quarterbacks, writing about them, or both I turn to the words of people much smarter than me. People who have been in the ring, on the sidelines, when it mattered. Terry Shea\u2019s body of work absolutely stands out, and his book Eyes Up contains a wealth of knowledge about the quarterback position gained from decades of experience. The subtitle to that book is also instructive here: Coaching the men with the nerve to play the most challenging position in football. Take this passage from Eyes Up: It can be argued that toughness \u2014 mental and physical \u2014 is as important as talent or self-confidence. One of the most challenging factors about Quarterbacking is adjusting to the mental and emotional pressure. The pressure can be enormous in games at all levels. As the game unfolds, a Quarterback\u2019s mental toughness is keenly tested. To hang in there when you are worn down and your body hurts. To possess the nerve to release the ball with anticipation. To keep getting up after each hit. To keep coming back. To refuse to lose. This is how mental toughness is defined. A mentally tough Quarterback produces the poise to play well in pressure situations and that is a defining virtue of Quarterback play. The best Quarterbacks aren\u2019t necessarily football\u2019s best passers. Winning Quarterbacks tend to be those signal callers who operate with precise Quarterback tools, fueled by a full tank of confidence and toughness. That is the part of Jaxson Dart\u2019s game that truly stands out to me. The willingness to stand in the pocket in the face of pressure and make a throw, knowing both that the play requires him to do that, and that pain may very well result. Take this example from Dart\u2019s bowl game against Duke: Note: Readers on Apple News will need to click the above link to see the clips. The Blue Devils bring pressure here, as Dart works this smash concept into the boundary between his tight end on the corner route and the running back underneath. He knows the big hit is coming \u2014 perhaps multiple big hits \u2014 but he hangs in the pocket and makes the throw, fighting in the face of pressure. Or take this throw against Mississippi State in the Egg Bowl: Consider the situation here: Mississippi faces 3rd and 5 in the red zone, in the fourth quarter, of a one-score game. The Bulldogs bring a Cover 0 blitz, and Dart knows they do not have the numbers in protection to block everyone. Someone is coming free. He hangs in the pocket, and throws a dime on a seam route, taking another hit in the process. But he then gets to celebrate. Let\u2019s look at one more example of this trait in action. This play comes from Dart\u2019s game against South Carolina. One of the most unnerving things you can experience as a quarterback is staring down a free rusher who has a full sprint into your chest, when you need to stand in the pocket, take the hit, and make a throw. That is exactly what Dart does on this play : There are certainly questions about Dart\u2019s overall evaluation, starting with how well the offense he ran at Mississippi will translate to the NFL, and how well that offense prepared him for said transition. But when it comes to one of the most unnatural parts of playing the position, Dart has that down pat. That speaks volumes about what he can be at the next level. Can he get to Plan C consistently? The biggest question facing Dart as he prepares for life in the NFL? Can he graduate from operating Lane Kiffin\u2019s offense at Mississippi, for what life will put in front of him at the next level? One of the main jobs of any offensive play designer and/or play caller is to make life easier on your quarterback in the passing game. Give them an answer for any coverage they will see on a given play, and simplify how they get to that answer. A given route design might have two different \u201chalf-field\u201d concepts, one that is designed to beat man coverage, and the other designed to beat zone coverage. Diagnose whether the defense is in man or zone, and you will get to your answer. Other play designs might have a progression read based on what specific coverage the defense is in. If it is Cover 3, read out one set of progressions, but if it is Cover 4, you read a different set. But what happens when the defense has your first few reads covered? Can you get to Plan C? That can be hard on Saturdays. It can be almost impossible on Sundays. When Dart got into trouble at Mississippi, it often came when the defense took his first read or two away, and forced him deep into progressions. Take this play against Mississippi State on a failed two-point conversion try: A few things stand out about this play, which Dart should try and improve upon as he moves to the NFL. First, Mississippi uses motion before the snap, bringing the outside receiver on the right into a stack alignment by motioning them toward the football. These two receivers each run out-breaking routes, and the idea is that the motion will create traffic in the secondary. However, if you watch how the defense reacts, a defender does not trail the motion man, which is a sign that the Bulldogs are in zone coverage. Dart ... might want to get his eyes elsewhere after the snap. However, he opens to the right, hoping to fit in a throw on one of the out routes. But with Mississippi State in zone coverage, neither is open, and he gets his eyes backside to the dig route. This might have been a better option to begin with, but he gets to it eventually. Yet, he waits for a pause too long and never sees the underneath \u201chole\u201d defense lurking. That defender reads his eyes perfectly and gets into the throwing lane for the easy interception. An offshoot of this is what I like to phrase as follows: \u201cWhat works on install day might not work on Saturday.\u201d Or Sunday, in the NFL case. When watching quarterbacks you can often see plays where the QB just locked into a route because it has worked in the past, perhaps during the \u201cinstall day\u201d during practice week, and assumes that things will click when that play is called during the game. They stare down the route and, well, you know what happens when you make assumptions ... Take this play against Mississippi State : Kiffin dials up a lovely design here, with a fake smoke screen to the right. Dart pumps on that fake screen, hoping to influence the secondary downhill to free the vertical route over the middle. Only, Mississippi State does not bite. Still, Dart throws that vertical route, eventually into double coverage. While the pass fell incomplete in this example, this is likely a turnover in the NFL. Then, well, there is the play was probably just shown during the highlight package when this pick was made: This comes on a 1st-and-10 situation late against Florida. Mississippi trails 24-17, has the ball in Florida territory, and has 1:47 remaining. Just about anything would have been better than this throw into triple coverage, in this situation. Mississippi\u2019s ensuing loss knocked them out of playoff contention. Dart is as tough as it gets at the QB position, but he\u2019ll need to clean up mistakes like this \u2014 and do a better job of getting to Plan C \u2014 at the next level.

Overlap with other subspecies of caribou is possible for contiguous range. 1. Rangifer tarandus caribou subdivided into ecotypes: boreal woodland; migratory woodland ; montane woodland; 2. Queen Charlotte Islands (extinct 1907); 3. Porcupine ; 4. barren-ground ; 5. Peary Synonyms reindeer in Europe and Eurasia A caribou ( Rangifer tarandus caribou , and other trinomials under Rangifer tarandus ) is any of several North American subspecies , ecotypes, populations, and herds [2] of the species Rangifer tarandus , or reindeer. [3] In North America caribou vary in size from the smallest, the Peary caribou , to the largest, the boreal woodland caribou. The North American range of caribou extends from Alaska , through the Yukon , the Northwest Territories , Nunavut , into the boreal forest and south through the Canadian Rockies and the Columbia and Selkirk Mountains . [4] Barren-ground, Porcupine caribou and Peary caribou live in the tundra , while the shy woodland caribou prefers the boreal forest. Two major subspecies in North America, the Porcupine caribou and the barren-ground caribou , form large herds and undertake lengthy seasonal migrations from birthing grounds, to summer and winter feeding grounds in the tundra and taiga . The migrations of Porcupine caribou herds are among the longest of any terrestrial mammal. [4] Barren-ground caribou are also found in Kitaa in Greenland, but the larger herds are in Alaska, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. [5] The circumpolar species itself, Rangifer tarandus , at a global level, is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (ICUN) as vulnerable \"due to an observed 40% decline over three generations (about 21\u201327 years) across the circum-Arctic countries, when Rangifer declined from about 4,800,000 to 2,890,410 individuals.\" [1] The populations of subspecies, ecotypes, populations and herds of caribou in North America are in decline [6] [7] [8] and one subspecies, the iconic boreal woodland caribou, has been listed by COSEWIC as threatened since 2002. [9] The George River caribou herd (GRCH), in the Ungava Peninsula of Quebec and Labrador in eastern Canada was once the world's largest herd with 800,000\u2013900,000 animals. By 2012 the herd numbered 27,600 and declined to 14,200 animals in 2014. [10] The metapopulation of the more-sedentary subspecies R. t. caribou , or woodland caribou, spans the boreal forest of Canada from the Northwest Territories to Labrador. They are shy animals whose main food source is arboreal lichens [8] of the mature forests [11] and mainly live in marshes, bogs, lakes, and river regions. [12] [13] Since it takes hundreds of years for a biomass of tree lichen to be adequate to sustain boreal woodland caribou populations, deforestation has been a major factor in the decline of their numbers. [8] The historic range of the boreal woodland caribou covered over half of present-day Canada, [14] stretching from Alaska to Newfoundland and Labrador and as far south as New England , Idaho , and Washington. The smallest subspecies in North America, the Peary caribou is found in the High and Low Arctic, in the Northwest Territories (particularly, Banks Island) and in Nunavut (mainly Baffin Island). The caribou is a specialist that is well adapted to cooler climates, with hollow-hair fur that covers almost all of its body including its nose, and provides insulation in winter and flotation for swimming. [4] Caribou can reach a speed of 60\u201380 km/h (37\u201350 mph). [1] Young caribou can already outrun an Olympic sprinter when only a day old. [15] The caribou's favourite winter food is fruticose deer lichen . Seventy percent of the diet of woodland caribou consists of arboreal lichen which take hundreds of years to grow and are therefore only found in mature forests. [11] Although there are many variations in colour and size, Canadian Geographic magazine states that in general, barren-ground caribou have larger antlers than the woodland caribou subspecies. Barren-ground caribou have large distinguishing white patches of fur that extend beyond the neck onto the back, a white muzzle and a face that is darker than the rest of the body. Their fur is sandy-beige in winter and light brown in summer. The woodland caribou have a wider more compact body and wider antlers. The coat is a rich dark brown in summer and dark grey in winter. Both the barren-ground and woodland caribou often have white \"socks\" above their hooves. [16] On average the male weighs 90\u2013110 kg (200\u2013240 lb) and measures 0.9\u20131.7 m (3.0\u20135.6 ft) in shoulder height. The woodland caribou are the largest, and the Peary caribou are the smallest. The largest Alaskan male Porcupine caribou can weigh as much as 310 kilograms (680 lb). Female caribou can live up to 17 years, and male caribou live about 13 years. [17] Both sexes grow antlers , though in some woodland caribou populations, the females lack antlers completely. Antlers are larger in males. Caribou are an integral part of First Nations and Inuit oral histories and legends including the Gwich'in creation story of how Gwich\u2019in people and the caribou separated from a single entity. [18] Nomenclature The term \"caribou\" derives from the Mi'kmaw word \" qalipu \" (pronounced /kah-li-bu/), literally meaning \"the shoveller\". Caribou have been referred to as reindeer or wild reindeer depending on context, specifically in Alaska [3] where attempts were made at importing domesticated reindeer from Siberia. There are occurrences of the subspecies barren-ground caribou in western Greenland. Current classifications of Rangifer tarandus , either with prevailing taxonomy on subspecies, designations based on ecotypes, and natural population groupings, fail to capture \"the variability of caribou across their range in Canada\" needed for effective species conservation and management. [19] \"Across the range of a species, individuals may display considerable morphological, genetic, and behavioural variability reflective of both plasticity and adaptation to local environments.\" [20] COSEWIC developed Designated Unit (DU) attribution to add to classifications already in use. [19] Naming and etymology Further information: Reindeer The name caribou comes, through the French, from the Mi'kmaq xalibu or Qalipu meaning \"the one who paws\". [21] Marc Lescarbot in his publication in French, [22] used the term \"caribou.\" Silas Tertius Rand translated the Mi'kmaq word Kaleboo as \"caribou\" in his Mi'kmaq-English. [23] [24] The Gwich\u2019in people have over two dozen distinct caribou-related words. [18] In Inuktitut , spoken in the eastern Arctic, the caribou is known by the name \" tuktu \". [25] With its range across North America and depth of history, Rangifer tarandus has countless aboriginal names. The nomadic Naskapi people followed the George River Caribou Herd . [26] \"By the late 1940s, the pressures of the fur trade, high rates of mortality and debilitation from diseases communicated by Europeans, and the effects of the virtual disappearance of the herd, reduced the Naskapi to a state where their very survival was threatened.\" [26] [27] Names for caribou in indigenous languages caribou syllabics or meaning language people region R. t. subspecies and ecotype language family qalipu one who paws Mi'kmaq Mi'kmaq what is now Eastern Canada and U.S. R. t. caribou Algonquian at\u00edhko caribou Woods Cree Cree Northern Manitoba R t groenlandicus Algonquian atihkw Cree-Montagnais-Naskapi region R. t. caribou Algonquian bedzeyh [28] Koyukon language Koyukon Alaska (Western Arctic caribou herd) R. t. granti Athabaskan vadzaih [18] caribou Gwich\u2019in language Gwich\u2019in Northwest Territories (Porcupine River) R. t. granti , Blue Nose herd, R.t. caribou Athabaskan w\u00ebdzey [29] H\u00e4n language H\u00e4n Athabaskan tuktu [30] Inuktitut Inuit Nunavut (barren-ground) and Labrador R. t. groenlandicus Eskimo\u2013Aleut tuttu [31] Inupiaq language Inupiat people Alaska R. t. granti (Western Arctic caribou herd) Eskimo\u2013Aleut tuntu [28] Yup'ik Yup'ik Alaska (Western Arctic caribou herd) R. t. granti Eskimo\u2013Aleut Biology and behaviour Reproduction and life-cycle Further information: Rut (mammalian reproduction) \u00a7 Cervidae According to SARA, in their latest compilation on woodland caribou, [32] \"The rut, or mating period, for caribou usually occurs in late September and the first half of October. Caribou cows begin breeding as early as 16 months of age; most breed annually by the time they are 28 months old, typically giving birth to a single calf the following spring (mid-May to mid-June). The males may theoretically breed at 18 to 20 months of age, but most probably have no opportunity before their third or fourth year. During the rut, males engage in frequent and furious sparring battles with their antlers. Large males with large antlers do most of the mating. To calve, females travel to isolated, relatively predator-free areas such as islands in lakes, peatlands, lakeshores, or tundra. Group size is lowest during calving and in summer; it increases before the rut and may decline or increase over the winter. Group size at all seasons is larger for forest-tundra caribou than forest-dwelling caribou. Survival rates for calves average between 30% and 50%, but can vary from almost none to 100%. Many factors interact to determine calf survival, including quality and quantity of forage (for pregnant females and in the first year of life), number of predators, and weather. The potential for very high survival means that it is possible for local populations to increase rapidly when conditions are favourable. \u2014 SARA 2014 Caribou mate in October and the gestation period is about 228\u2013234 days. [17] In May or June the calves are born. [17] Males live 4 years less than the females whose maximum longevity is about 17 years. Females with a normal body size who have had sufficient summer nutrition, can begin breeding anytime between the ages of one to three years. [17] When a female has undergone nutritional stress, it is possible for her to not reproduce for the year. [33] Dominant males, those with larger body size and antler racks, inseminate more than one doe a season. To calve, \"females travel to isolated, relatively predator-free areas such as islands in lakes, peatlands, lakeshores, or tundra.\" [32] As females select the habitat for the birth of their calves, they are more wary than males. [17] Dugmore noted that in their seasonal migrations the herd follows a doe for that reason. [34] Newborns weigh on average 6 kg (13 lb). [35] As the weather cools in the fall, barren-ground and Porcupine caribou leave their summer grounds forming large herds and migrate south for the winter. They start mating when large lakes were frozen over. Just prior to mating, the males of both caribou are in prime condition, fat and ready to battle for mates. Bulls at this time are more aggressive and they are usually alone. [36] Physical characteristics Antlers Male caribou used their antlers to compete with other males during the mating season. \"During the rut, males engage in frequent and furious sparring battles with their antlers. Large males with large antlers do most of the mating.\" [32] The velvet that covers growing antlers is a highly vascularized skin. When the antler growth is fully grown and hardened, the velvet is shed or rubbed off. Caribou continue to migrate until the bull caribou had spent the back fat (IOHP 065). After the mating season, the male caribou shed his antlers, growing a new pair the next summer with a larger rack than the previous year. As the antler grows it is covered in thick velvet, filled with blood vessels and spongy in texture. In the woodland caribou, the velvet is brown. [36] ...these antlers get detached every year\u2026 Young males lose the velvet from the antlers much more quickly than female caribou even though they are not fully mature. They start to work with their antlers just as soon as the velvet starts to fall off. The young males engage in fights with their antlers towards autumn\u2026 soon after the velvet had fallen off they will be red, as they start to get bleached their colour changes\u2026 When the velvet starts to fall off the antler is red because the antler is made from blood. The antler is the blood that has hardened, in fact the core of the antler is still bloody when the velvet starts to fall off, at least close to the base. \u2014 Noah Piugaattuk of Igloolik (IOHP 037) In most caribou subspecies, both males and females grow antlers \u2014unique among cervid species. Some R. t. caribou ecotype females do not have antlers. The antlers typically have two separate groups of points, a lower and upper. There is considerable subspecific variation in the size of the antlers (e.g., rather small and spindly in R. t. pearyi ), [37] but, on average, the bull's antlers are the second largest of any living deer, after the moose . In the largest caribou\u2014 R. t. caribou \u2014antlers of large males can range up to 100 cm (39 in) in width [38] and 135 cm (53 in) in beam length. They have the largest antlers relative to body size among living deer species. Males have larger, more-extravagant antlers, but most females have antlers too during part of the year, although some females may have only one antler or no antlers at all. [39] [12] (Boreal Caribou ATK Reports, 2010-2011) The antler's main beam begins at the brow \"extending posterior over the shoulders and bowing so that the tips point forwards. The prominent, palmate brow tines extend forward, over the face.\" [40] In late fall or early winter after the rut, male caribou lose their antlers. Female caribou keep their antlers until they calve. Antlers begin to grow on male caribou in March and on female caribou in May or June. This process is called antlerogenesis. While the antler is developing, it is covered in velvet which is rubbed off when the antler bone hardens. This velvet is dark brown on woodland or barren-ground caribou and slate grey on Peary caribou. [40] Antlers grow very quickly every year on the males. Velvet lumps in March can develop into a rack measuring more than a metre in length (3 ft) by August. When bull caribou shed their antlers in early to midwinter, the antlered female caribou acquire the highest ranks in the feeding hierarchy, gaining access to the best forage areas. These cows are healthier than those without antlers. [41] Calves whose mothers do not have antlers are more prone to disease and have significantly higher mortality. [41] Females in good nutritional condition, for example, during a mild winter with good winter range quality, may grow new antlers earlier as antler growth requires high intake. [41] Antler size measured in number of points reflects the nutritional status of the caribou and climate variation of its environment. [42] [43] The number of points on male caribou increased from birth to five-years of age and remained relatively constant from then on. [44] \"In male caribou, antler mass (but not the number of tines) varies in concert with body mass.\" [45] [46] While antlers of bull woodland caribou are typically smaller than barren-ground caribou, they can be over one metre across. They are flattened, compact, and relatively dense. [47] Geist describes them as frontally emphasized, flat-beamed antlers. [48] Woodland caribou antlers are thicker and broader than those of the barren-ground caribou, and their legs and heads are longer. [47] The antler velvet of the barren-ground caribou and woodland caribou are dark chocolate brown. [49] Quebec-Labrador bull caribou antlers can be significantly larger and wider than other woodland caribou. Central barren-ground bull caribou are perhaps the most diverse in configuration and can grow to be very high and wide. Mountain caribou are typically the most massive with the largest circumference measurements. Peary caribou and the Dolphin-Union Caribou herd have light slate-grey antler velvet. [50] Size In all caribou subspecies males are 10% to 50% heavier than females. Weight varies drastically seasonally with males losing as much as 40% of their pre-rut weight. [35] The woodland caribou is the largest of the North American caribou subspecies. [51] Their legs and heads are longer than the barren-ground caribou. [47] The Porcupine, barren-ground Bluenose caribou herd, and woodland caribou all occupy Gwich'in land. According to traditional knowledge woodland caribou are easily distinguishable from Porcupine caribou. They are much bigger than the Porcupine caribou \"half between a caribou and a moose.\" [52] Peary caribou are the size of a deer. Size male caribou caribou total length [35] height at shoulder weight average male caribou all subspecies 167\u2013298 cm (5.48\u20139.78 ft) [35] 87\u2013158 cm (2.85\u20135.18 ft) [35] 66\u2013300 kg (146\u2013661 lb) [35] largest male 310 kg (680 lb) Size female caribou caribou total length height at shoulder weight average female caribou all subspecies 105.4\u2013234 cm (41.5\u201392.1 in) [35] 80\u2013139 cm (31\u201355 in) [35] 51\u2013156 kg (112\u2013344 lb) [35] Caribou across North America range in size. In the farthest west, Alaskan caribou females usually measure 162\u2013205 cm (5.31\u20136.73 ft) in length and weigh 80\u2013120 kg (180\u2013260 lb). [53] The males (or \"bulls\") are typically larger (although the extent to which varies in the different subspecies), measuring 180\u2013214 cm (71\u201384 in) in length and usually weighing 159\u2013182 kg (351\u2013401 lb), [53] though exceptionally large males have weighed as much as 318 kg (701 lb). [53] Shoulder height typically measure from 85 to 150 cm (2.79 to 4.92 ft), and the tail is 14 to 20 cm (0.46 to 0.66 ft) long. Pelage The colour of the fur varies considerably, both individually and depending on season and subspecies. The Peary caribou are whiter and relatively small; woodland caribou are darker brown with unique patches of white fur. The Alaskan and barren-ground caribou are greyer than the woodland caribou. [37] The coat has two layers of fur: a dense woolly undercoat and longer-haired overcoat consisting of hollow, air-filled hairs. [54] [Notes 1] [54] Fur is the primary insulation factor that allows caribou to regulate their core body temperature in relation to their environment, the thermogradient, even if the temperature rises to 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). [55] In 1913 Dugmore noted how the woodland caribou swim so high out of the water, unlike any other mammal, because their hollow, \"air-filled, quill-like hair\" acts as a supporting \"life jacket.\" [34] The boreal woodland caribou is well-adapted to cold environments with a compact body covered with a thick and long coat (thicker in winter than in summer). [12] They with a large blunt muzzle, short wide ears, and a small tail. Adults have a brown to dark-brown coat in summer, [12] becoming grayer in winter. [12] Its body is covered in long, thick hairs that almost uniformly dark brown [48] in summer and nearly gray in winter. Adults have distinctive creamy white neck, mane, shoulder stripe, underbelly, underside of the tail, and patch above each hoof [56] (Boreal Caribou ATK Reports, 2010-2011). [57] The woodland caribou is darker in colour than the barren-ground caribou. [52] Hooves The caribou has large feet with crescent-shaped, cloven hooves for walking in snow or swamps. According to the Species at Risk Public Registry ( SARA ), woodland, [32] \"Caribou have large feet with four toes. In addition to two small ones, called \"dew claws,\" they have two large, crescent-shaped toes that support most of their weight and serve as shovels when digging for food under snow. These large concave hooves offer stable support on wet, soggy ground and on crusty snow. The pads of the hoof change from a thick, fleshy shape in the summer to become hard and thin in the winter months, reducing the animal\u2019s exposure to the cold ground. Additional winter protection comes from the long hair between the \"toes\"; it covers the pads so the caribou walks only on the horny rim of the hooves.\" \u2014 SARA 2014 Their hooves adapt to the season: in the summer, when the tundra is soft and wet, the footpads become sponge-like and provide extra traction. In the winter, the pads shrink and tighten, exposing the rim of the hoof, which cuts into the ice and crusted snow to keep it from slipping. This also enables them to dig down (an activity known as \"cratering\"). [58] \"In the winter, the fleshy pads on these toes grow longer and form a tough, hornlike rim. Caribou use these large, sharp-edged hooves to dig through the snow and uncover the lichens that sustain them in winter months. Biologists call this activity \"cratering\" because of the crater-like cavity the caribou\u2019s hooves leave in the snow.\" [59] through the snow to their favorite food, a lichen known as reindeer moss . Countercurrent heat exchange Blood moving into the legs is cooled by blood returning to the body in a countercurrent heat exchange (CCHE), a highly efficient means of minimizing heat loss through the skin's surface. In the CCHE mechanism, in cold weather, blood vessels are closely knotted and intertwined with arteries to the skin and appendages that carry warm blood with veins returning to the body that carry cold blood causing the warm arterial blood to exchange heat with the cold venous blood. In this way, their legs for example are kept cool, maintaining the core body temperature nearly 30 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) higher with less heat lost to the environment. Heat is recycled instead of being dissipated. The \"heart does not have to pump blood as rapidly in order to maintain a constant body core temperature and thus, metabolic rate.\" CCHE is present in animals like caribou, fox and moose living in extreme conditions of cold or hot weather as a mechanism for retaining the heat in (or out of) the body. These are countercurrent exchange systems with the same fluid, usually blood, in a circuit, used for both directions of flow. [60] North American caribou, have specialized counter-current vascular heat exchange in their nasal passages. [61] Temperature gradient along the nasal mucosa is under physiological control. [61] Incoming cold air is warmed by body heat before entering the lungs, and water is condensed from the expired air and captured before the deer's breath is exhaled, used to moisten dry incoming air and possibly absorbed into the blood through the mucous membranes . [61] Like moose , caribou have specialized noses featuring nasal turbinate bones that dramatically increase the surface area within the nostrils . Clicking sound According to thirty-year veteran, David Shackleton, University of British Columbia emeritus professor, who has published widely on ungulates and other large mammals, the clicking sound made by caribou as they walk is caused by small tendons slipping over bone protuberances (sesamoid bones) in their feet. [62] [58] Dugmore, who in 1913 spent considerable time in the field studying Newfoundland woodland caribou at close range, considered this curious clicking sound, made when a caribou was walking or running, which he thought was made by some internal mechanism of the foot, to be one of the caribou's strangest characteristics. The sound occurred when the full weight of the foot is on the ground or just after it is relieved of the weight. On a quiet day, the sound can be heard 150 feet (46 m) or more away. [34] Diet Caribou licking salt from roadway in British Columbia Rangifer tarandus are ruminants , having a four-chambered stomach. They mainly eat lichens in winter, especially reindeer moss \u2014the \"only large mammal able to metabolize lichen owing to specialized bacteria and protozoa in their gut.\" [63] Each ecotype eats a diet based on the surrounding ecology. Mountain caribou eat lichen from trees, for example. They have been known to eat their own fallen antlers, probably for calcium. They also eat the leaves of willows and birches , as well as sedges and grasses . Seasonal body composition Caribou have developed adaptions for optimal metabolic efficiency during warm months as well as for during cold months. [64] The body composition of caribou varies highly with the seasons. Of particular interest is the body composition and diet of breeding and non-breeding females between seasons. Breeding females have more body mass than non-breeding females between the months of March and September with a difference of around 10 kg more than non-breeding females. From November to December, non-breeding females have more body mass than breeding females as non-breeding females were able to focus their energies towards storage during colder months rather than lactation and reproduction. Body masses of both breeding and non-breeding females peaked in September. During the months of March through April, breeding females have more fat mass than the nonbreeding females with a difference of almost 3 kg. After this however, nonbreeding females on average have a higher fat mass than the breeding females. [65] The environmental variations play a large part in caribou nutrition, as winter nutrition is crucial to adult and neonatal survival rates. [66] Lichens are a staple during the winter months as they\u2019re a readily available food source, which reduces the reliance on stored body reserves. [65] Lichens are a crucial part of the caribou diet, however they are less prevalent in the diet of pregnant caribou compared to non-pregnant individuals. The amount of lichen in a diet is found more in non-pregnant adult diets than pregnant individuals due to the lack of nutritional value. Although lichens are high in carbohydrates, they are lacking in essential proteins that vascular plants provide. The amount of lichen in a diet decreases in latitude that results in nutritional stress being higher in areas with low lichen abundance. [67] Migration and range Alaskan caribou aggregation in 1002 Area, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (April 2008) Some populations of the North American caribou, for example, many herds in the subspecies, the barren-ground caribou, and some woodland caribou in Ungava and Labrador, migrate the farthest of any terrestrial mammal, travelling up to 5,000 km (3,100 mi) a year, and covering 1,000,000 km 2 (390,000 sq mi). [1] [68] Other North American populations, the woodland caribou (boreal) for example, are largely sedentary. [69] Smaller herds and island herds like R. t. pearsoni make the shortest migrations least. Normally travelling about 19\u201355 km (12\u201334 mi) a day while migrating, the caribou can run at speeds of 60\u201380 km/h (37\u201350 mph). [1] Young caribou can already outrun an Olympic sprinter when only a day old. [70] During the spring migration smaller herds will group together to form larger herds of 50,000 to 500,000 animals. During autumn migrations groups become smaller and they begin to mate. During the winter, migratory herds travel to winter feeding grounds along coastlines in the tundra above the tree line. Below the tree line they shift to the forest for winter feeding. By spring, groups leave their winter grounds to go to the calving grounds. A caribou can swim easily and quickly, normally at 6.5 km/h (4.0 mph) but if necessary at 10 km/h (6.2 mph), and migrating herds will not hesitate to swim across a large lake or broad river. [1] Ecology Distribution and habitat Originally, the caribou range spanned the northern conterminous USA from Washington to Maine . In the 19th century, it was apparently still present in southern Idaho . [1] During the late Pleistocene era, reindeer were found as far south as Nevada and Tennessee in North America. [71] According to the Grubb, [5] Rangifer tarandus is \"circumboreal in the tundra and taiga\" from \"Alaska (USA) and Canada including most Arctic islands, and USA (Northern Idaho and the Great Lakes region). [5] Predators Predation by wolves, bears, coyotes, cougar, and lynx and over-hunting by people in some areas, contribute to the decline of the populations of woodland caribou. [32] Healthy caribou are faster than their predators including wolves. Wolverines \u2014who are themselves a threatened species in some parts of Canada\u2014 can kill adult caribou. Bears prey on caribou but are most likely to attack weaker animals, such as calves and sick deer. As carrion, caribou are fed on opportunistically by foxes , ravens , hawks , and golden eagles ( Aquila chrysaetos ). White-tailed deer, a threat to caribou White-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) commonly carry meningeal worm or brainworm, a nematode parasite that causes caribou, moose ( Alces alces ), elk ( Cervus canadensis ), and mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ) to develop fatal neurological symptoms [72] [73] [74] which include a loss of fear of humans. White-tailed deer that carry this worm are partly immune to it. [75] Changes in climate and habitat beginning in the twentieth century have expanded range overlap between white-tailed deer and caribou, increasing the frequency of infection within the caribou population. This increase in infection is a concern for wildlife managers. Human activities, such as \"clear-cutting forestry practices, forest fires, and the clearing for agriculture, roadways, railways, and power lines,\" [76] favour the conversion of habitats into the preferred habitat of the white-tailed deer-\"open forest interspersed with meadows, clearings, grasslands, and riparian flatlands.\" [76] Wolves Through human activities in northeastern Alberta for example, there have been dramatic changes in forest composition. The increase in young deciduous forest stands attract and sustain increased number of moose, elk and/or deer. These changes lead to increases in the number of predators, especially wolves, and a subsequent increase in predation threat to caribou. [77] [78] White-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) expanded further north and west to Prince George as the land adjacent to the northern Rockies was converted by industry or agriculture into a habitat that is favourable to deer, widespread deciduous vegetation. As the density of white-tailed deer increased in the post-industrial period (2005\u20132009), so did the population of wolves ( Canis lupus ), the primary and natural predator of caribou. The higher density of wolves led to higher woodland caribou mortality. During this period wolves consumed more deer and fewer moose. Caribou increased 10-fold in the diet of wolves in northeast Alberta and caribou population trends in the region changed from stable to declining.\" [79] Wolves ( Canis lupus ) are the natural and primary predators of caribou. [80] Since the 1920s there have been no wolves on the island of Newfoundland. Without wolves, caribou can overgraze and out feed their range. [81] In 1980, Slate Island , located in northern Lake Superior , 10 km (6.2 mi) south of the town of Terrace Bay , where there are no wolves or other predators, had the highest density of woodland caribou in the world with a population peaking at 660. [82] The population of woodland caribou in the northeastern corner of British Columbia is in an area with a high density of wolves and there is concern that the caribou herd is not self-sustaining. [13] The woodland caribou population of the Selkirk Mountains in extreme northern Idaho , eastern Washington, and British Columbia is in an area with a high incidence of whitetail deer and wolves and caribou numbers declined dramatically. [83] [84] [85] In the preparation of their recovery strategy for woodland caribou in Alberta, the Alberta Woodland Caribou Recovery Team, concluded that wolf predation was the most common cause of adult woodland caribou mortality.\" [78] [86] [87] \"Although caribou have co-existed with predators for millennia in Alberta, recent human activities and forest fires (both human and naturally caused) have increased the vulnerability of caribou to predation. Changes in forest composition and the development of access routes are thought to be primary causes. For example, both timber harvesting and fire increase the amount of young forest stands and of various plant species, which in many cases attract and sustain increased number of moose, elk and/or deer. These changes lead to increases in the number of predators, especially wolves, and a subsequent increase in predation threat to caribou. [77] [78] In addition, habitat loss and alteration (including carriers to caribou movement and reduced use of areas by caribou) may concentrate caribou in restricted portions of their range. [88] [89] Since maintaining low population densities is one of the ways that caribou avoid predation, this concentration of animals may lead to greater caribou mortality. Finally, research has demonstrated that linear access corridors facilitate wolf travel and hunting behaviour within caribou range. [90] [91] Continued industrial and/or non-industrial use of corridors may further facilitate wolf-hunting efficiency by compacting snow during winter.\" [78] The population of caribou in Pukaskwa National Park has \"declined from approximately 30 caribou in the 1970s to an estimated four currently, largely due to predation by wolves and possibly black bears.\" [92] According to the Canadian Wildlife Federation in Canada, \"Despite its vast range, the boreal population of woodland caribou [boreal ecotype of forest-dwelling woodland caribou] has been listed as threatened by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) since 2002 and endangered in British Columbia. One of the main reasons numbers are dropping is that fewer calves are surviving their first year of life. The main cause is predation. More calves are being preyed on by wolves and black bears than ever before.\" [51] Insect harassment Tormenting insects keep caribou on the move searching for windy areas like hilltops and mountain ridges, rock reefs, lakeshore and forest openings, or snow patches that offer respite from the buzzing horde. Gathering in large herds is another strategy caribou use to block insects. [93] \"Changes in insect phenology \u2013 earlier emergence and increased abundance \u2013 indirectly reduce summer forage availability by reducing the amount of time Rangifer can spend foraging undisturbed. \u2014 Vors 2013:16 Mosquitoes ( Culicidae ), black flies ( Simuliidae ), and oestrid flies (warble flies) Hypoderma tarandi and nose bot flies ( Cephenemyia trompe ) harass caribou herds particularly during the prime foraging period which is the post-calving and summer period. As temperatures on the tundra rose, the number of black and oestrid flies in the Bathurst barren-ground caribou herd study area in Northwest Territories increased. [94] Feeding is inhibited and energy expended as panicked caribou attempt to escape insects resulting in loss of weight, poorer body condition and reproductive capacity. [95] An adult reindeer will lose perhaps about 1 litre (0.26 US gal) of blood to biting insects for every week it spends in the tundra. [15] So a warmer Arctic climate will produce better vegetation for foraging caribou, this will be offset by increased harassment by insects. [94] Taxonomy and evolution The species taxonomic name Rangifer tarandus (reindeer, caribou) was defined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The subspecies taxonomic name, Rangifer tarandus caribou was defined by Gmelin in 1788. According to the then- Canadian Wildlife Service Chief Mammalogist, Frank Banfield, in his often-cited A Revision of the Reindeer and Caribou, Genus Rangifer (1961), [96] R. t. caboti ( Labrador caribou), R. t. osborni (Osborn's caribou\u2014from British Columbia ) and R. t. terraenovae ( Newfoundland caribou) were considered invalid and included in R. t. caribou . Some recent authorities have considered them all valid, even suggesting that they are quite distinct. In their book entitled Mammal Species of the World , American zoologist Don E. Wilson and DeeAnn Reeder agree with Valerius Geist, specialist on large North American mammals, that this range actually includes several subspecies . [97] [98] [99] [100] [Notes 2] The woodland caribou's frontally emphasized, flat-beamed antlers are evident in this drawing by Foresman Geist (2007) argued that the \"true woodland caribou, the uniformly dark, small-manned type with the frontally emphasized, flat-beamed antlers\", which is \"scattered thinly along the southern rim of North American caribou distribution\" has been incorrectly classified. He affirms that \"true woodland caribou is very rare, in very great difficulties and requires the most urgent of attention.\" [48] In 2005, an analysis of mtDNA found differences between the caribou from Newfoundland, Labrador, south-western Canada and south-eastern Canada, but maintained all in R. t. caribou . [2] Mallory and Hillis [101] argued that, \"Although the taxonomic designations reflect evolutionary events, they do not appear to reflect current ecological conditions. In numerous instances, populations of the same subspecies have evolved different demographic and behavioural adaptations, while populations from separate subspecies have evolved similar demographic and behavioural patterns... \"[U]nderstanding ecotype in relation to existing ecological constraints and releases may be more important than the taxonomic relationships between populations.\" [101] Evolution The caribou \"evolved in North America and spread to Eurasia where they are known as reindeer.\" [17] The \"glacial-interglacial cycles of the upper Pleistocene had a major influence on the evolution\" of Rangifer tarandus and other Arctic and sub-Arctic species. Much of the Late Pleistocene age was dominated by glaciation (the Wisconsin glaciation in North America and corresponding glacial periods in Eurasia). Rangifer tarandus was isolated in refugia during the last glacial - the Wisconsin in North America\u2014extending approximately from 85,000 BP to 11,000 BP\u2014and the Weishselian. [102] According to research based on mitochondrial DNA , \"ancestral populations of R. t. caribou likely survived the Wisconsin glaciation in separate refugia located south of the continental ice sheet, while other Rangifer tarandus subspecies\"\u2014 R. t. groenlandicus and R. t. granti \u2014\"survived north of the ice sheet.\" [2] (R\u00f8ed et al. 1991) [102] Newfoundland caribou are most closely related to other woodland caribou ( R. t. caribou ) from Labrador, Quebec, and Alberta rather than barren-ground caribou (R.t groenlandicus and R. t. granti ) from northern Canada and Alaska. [2] Phylogenetics Phylogenetic analyses of caribou reveal that caribou were isolated by the ice sheet into two glacial refugia, a northern Beringia European Lineage (BEL) and North American Lineage (NAL) [2] [102] diverging about 300,000 years ago [103] [104] When the ice sheet melted, the NAL caribou \"spread west across the boreal region, and north into the Rocky Mountains.\" The BEL caribou \"spread south from the Beringean refugium in present-day western Yukon, north into the Arctic islands and eastward.\" [105] Subspecies The canonical Mammal Species of the World (2005) recognized fourteen subspecies of Rangifer tarandus globally. [5] Two of these subspecies are only in North America\u2014the Porcupine caribou and Peary caribou. Barren-ground caribou are found in western Greenland, but the larger herds are in Alaska, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.

Allen, 1914 The table above includes R. tarandus caboti (Labrador caribou), R. tarandus osborni (Osborn's caribou \u2013 from British Columbia) and R. tarandus terraenovae (Newfoundland caribou). Based on Banfield's review in 1961, [96] R. tarandus caboti (Labrador caribou), R. tarandus osborni (Osborn's caribou \u2013 from British Columbia) and R. tarandus terraenovae (Newfoundland caribou) were considered invalid and included in R. tarandus caribou . However, more recent authorities [Notes 4] have considered them all valid, even suggesting that they are quite distinct. [106] [99] An analysis of mtDNA in 2005 found differences between the caribou from Newfoundland, Labrador, south-western Canada and south-eastern Canada, but maintained all in R. t. caribou . [2] Some of the species Rangifer tarandus and subspecies may be further divided by ecotype depending on several behavioural factors - predominant habitat use (northern, tundra, mountain, forest, boreal forest, forest-dwelling, woodland, woodland (mountain), woodland (boreal), woodland (migratory), spacing (dispersed or aggregated) and migration (sedentary or migratory). [80] [107] [108] Rangifer tarandus by country North America Approximate range of caribou subspecies in North America. Overlap is possible for contiguous range. 1. Rangifer tarandus caribou subdivided into ecotypes: woodland (boreal), woodland (migratory) , woodland (montane), 2. R. t. dawsoni extinct 1907, 3. R. t. granti , 4. R. t. groenlandicus , 5. Groenlandicus/Pearyi 6. R. t. pearyi There are four living subspecies of R. tarandus , locally known in North America as caribou\u2014 Rangifer tarandus caribou subdivided into ecotypes: woodland (boreal), woodland (migratory) , woodland (montane), R. t. granti , R. t. groenlandicus and R. t. pearyi . In North America, because of its vast range in a wide diversity of ecosystems, the subspecies Rangifer tarandus caribou is further distinguished by a number of ecotypes, including boreal woodland caribou, mountain woodland caribou and migratory woodland caribou ). [80] [107] [108] Populations\u2014caribou that do not migrate\u2014or herds\u2014those that do migrate\u2014may not fit into narrow ecotypes. For example, Banfield's 1961 classification of the migratory George River Caribou Herd, in the Ungava region of Quebec and Labrador, as subspecies Rangifer tarandus caribou , woodland caribou, remains\u2014although other woodland caribou are mainly sedentary. United States Although there are remnant populations of R. t. caribou boreal woodland caribou in the northern United States, most of U.S. caribou populations are in Alaska. There are four herds in Alaska, the Western Arctic herd, Teshekpuk Lake herd, the Central Arctic herd and the Porcupine herd. Alaska Alaska has several herds of R. t. granti . The largest is the Western Arctic Caribou Herd but the smaller Porcupine caribou herd has the longest migration of any terrestrial mammal on earth with a vast historical range. The smaller Central Arctic herd (32 000 in 2002). Porcupine caribou herd Main article: Porcupine caribou Male Porcupine caribou R. t. granti in Alaska Migratory caribou herds are named after their birthing grounds, in this case the Porcupine River , which runs through a large part of the range of the Porcupine herd. Individual herds of migratory caribou once had over a million animals per herd, and could taking over ten days to cross the Yukon River, but these numbers dramatically declined with habitat disturbance and degradation. Though numbers fluctuate, the herd comprises approximately 169 000 animals (based on a July 2010 photocensus). [109] The Porcupine herd's annual migrations of 1,500 miles (2,400 km) are among the longest of any terrestrial mammal. [4] Their range spans approximately 260,000 km 2 (64,000,000 acres), from Dawson City, Yukon to Aklavik, NWT to Kaktovik, Alaska on the Beaufort Sea . The Porcupine caribou or Grant's caribou ( Rangifer tarandus granti ) is a subspecies with a vast range that includes northeastern Alaska and the Yukon , and is therefore cooperatively managed by government agencies and aboriginal peoples from both countries. [106] [2] The Gwich'in people , followed the Porcupine caribou herd\u2014their primary source of food, tools, and clothing\u2014for thousands of years\u2014according to oral tradition, for as long as 20,000 years. They continued their nomadic lifestyle until the 1870s. [110] This herd is also traditional food for the Inupiat, Inuvialuit , H\u00e4n, and Northern Tutchone . There is currently controversy over whether possible future oil drilling on the coastal plains of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , encompassing much of the Porcupine caribou calving grounds, will have a severe negative impact on the caribou population or whether the caribou population will grow. Unlike many other Rangifer tarandus subspecies and their ecotypes, the Porcupine herd is stable at relatively high numbers, but the 2013 photo-census was not counted by January 2014. [111] The peak population in 1989 of 178,000 animals was followed by a decline by 2001 to 123,000. However, by 2010, there was a recovery and an increase to 169,000 animals. [111] [109] Many Gwich'in people, who depend on the Porcupine caribou, still follow traditional caribou management practices that include a 1981 prohibition against selling caribou meat and limits on the number of caribou to be taken per hunting trip. [112] All three herds cross the Brooks Range in their annual migrations. The Western Arctic herd reached a low of 75,000 in the mid-1970s. In 1997 the 90,000 WACH changed their migration and wintered on Seward Peninsula where Alaskan reindeer normally wintered. The reindeer, part of the Reindeer Project herds brought north from Siberia via Alaska, joined the WACH on their summer migration and disappeared. [113] The WACH reached a peak of 490,000 in 2003 and then declined to 325,000 in 2011. [109] [28] In 2008, the Teshekpuk Lake herd had 64,107 animals and the Central Arctic herd had 67,000. [114] [115] Reindeer imported to Alaska Reindeer were imported from Siberia in the late 19th century and from Norway in the early 1900s as semi-domesticated livestock in Alaska. [116] [117] Reindeer interbreed with native caribou subspecies. Canada Nunavut The barren-ground caribou subspecies R. t. groenlandicus , [96] a long-distance migrant, includes large herds in the Northwest Territories and in Nunavut, for example the Beverly, the Ahiak and Qamanirjuaq herds. In 1996 the population of the Ahiak herd was approximately 250 000 animals. Ahiak, Beverly, Qamanirjuaq herds The Ahiak, Beverly, and Qamanirjuaq herds are barren-ground caribou. The Beverly herd of barren-ground caribou, Thelon River , Nunavut. \"The Beverly herd\u2019s crossing of the Thelon River to its traditional calving grounds near Beverly Lake was part of the lives of the Dene aboriginal people for 8 000 years, as revealed by an unbroken archaeological record of deep layers of caribou bones and stone tools in the banks of the Thelon River (Gordon 2005).\" [118] [119] The Beverly Herd (located primarily in Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories; portions in Nunavut, Manitoba, Alberta) and the Qamanirjuaq Herd (located primarily in Manitoba, Nunavut; portions in southeastern NWT, northeastern Saskatchewan) fall under the auspices of the Beverly and Qamanirjuaq Caribou Management Board. [120] In 2011 the combined Beverly/Ahiak herd in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, had approximately 124,000 caribou\u2014at least a 50% drop since 1994; the Western caribou herd had 325,000 animals, [111] [28] and the Beverly herd, whose range spans the tundra from northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan and well into the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, had a peak population in 1994 of 276,000 [121] [122] or 294,000; [111] but by 2011 there were approximately 124,000 caribou in the Beverly herd and 83,300 in the Ahiak herd. The calving grounds of the Beverly caribou herd are located around Queen Maud Gulf but the herd shifted its traditional birthing area. [123] Caribou management agencies are concerned that deterioration and disturbance of habitat along with \"parasites, predation and poor weather\" [124] are contributing to a cycling down of most caribou populations. It was suggested the Ahiak and Beverly herds switched calving grounds and the Beverly may have moved \"near the western Queen Maud Gulf coast to the north of the herd\u2019s \"traditional\" calving ground in the Gary Lakes area north of Baker Lake.\" [125] The \"Beverly herd may have declined (similar to other Northwest Territories herds), and cows switched to the neighbouring Ahiak herd to maintain the advantages of gregarious calving.\" [126] By 2011 there were approximately 124,000 caribou in the combined Beverly/Ahiak herd which represents a \"50% or a 75% decline from the 1994 population estimate for the Beverly Herd.\" [111] Qamanirjuaq caribou herd which is relatively stable had declined from 496,000 in 1994 to 345,000 in 2008. [7] The barren-ground caribou population on Southampton Island , Nunavut declined by almost 75%, from about 30 000 caribou in 1997 to 7,800 caribou in 2011. [111] [127] Dolphin-Union Caribou Main article: Dolphin-Union Caribou The Dolphin-Union Caribou herd, locally known as island caribou , [128] [129] are a migratory population of barren-ground caribou, Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus , that occupy Victoria Island in Canada's High Arctic and the nearby mainland. They are endemic to Canada. They migrate across the Dolphin and Union Strait from their summer grazing on Victoria Island to their winter grazing area on the Nunavut-NWT mainland in Canada. [128] [130] It is unusual for North American caribou to seasonally cross sea ice and the only other caribou to do so are the Peary caribou who are smaller in size and population. Peary caribou Main article: Peary caribou The Peary caribou is a relatively small and pale subspecies found in the tundra of far northern North America. The R. t. pearyi ( Peary caribou ), the smallest of the species, known as Tuktu in Inuktitut, are found in the High Arctic of Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. The Peary caribou a Canadian endemic subspecies and appears to be of postglacial origin. They remain at low numbers after severe declines and all populations are listed as endangered by COSEWIC. On Baffin Island, the largest Arctic island, the population of Peary caribou peaked in the early 1990s to approximately 60 000 to 180 000. [131] By 2012, in northern Baffin Island caribou numbers were considered to be at a \"low in the cycle after a high in the 1990s\" and in south Baffin Island, the population was estimated as between 1 065 and 2 067. [132] Northwest Territories There are four barren-ground caribou herds in the Northwest Territories\u2014Cape Bathurst, Bluenose West, Bluenose East and Bathurst . [111] The Bluenose East caribou herd began a recovery with a population of approximately 122 000 in 2010. [133] which is being credited to the establishment of Tuktut Nogait National Park . [134] According to T. Davison 2010, CARMA 2011, the three other herds \"declined 84-93% from peak sizes in the mid-1980s and 1990s. [111] R. t. caribou Main article: Boreal woodland caribou The subspecies R. t. caribou commonly known as woodland caribou, is divided into ecotypes: boreal woodland caribou, (also known as forest-dwelling woodland caribou), mountain woodland caribou and migratory woodland caribou ). Caribou are classified by ecotype depending on several behavioural factors - predominant habitat use (northern, tundra, mountain, forest, boreal forest, forest-dwelling), spacing (dispersed or aggregated) and migration (sedentary or migratory). [80] [107] [108] In Canada, the national meta-population of the sedentary boreal ecotype spans the boreal forest from the Northwest Territories to Labrador . They prefer lichen-rich mature forests [135] and mainly live in marshes, bogs, lakes, and river regions. [136] [137] The historic range of the boreal woodland caribou covered over half of present-day Canada, [138] stretching from Alaska to Newfoundland and Labrador and as far south as New England , Idaho, and Washington. Woodland caribou have disappeared from most of their original southern range. The boreal woodland was designated as threatened in 2002. [9] In 2011 there were approximately 34 000 boreal caribou in 51 ranges remaining in Canada. [139] George River caribou herd (GRCH) Main article: George River (Quebec) The migratory George River caribou herd (GRCH), in the Ungava region of Quebec and Labrador in eastern Canada was once the world's largest herd with 800 000\u2013900 000 animals. Although it is categorized as a subspecies Rangifer tarandus caribou , [96] the woodland caribou, the GRCH is migratory and like the barren-ground caribou it's ecotype may be tundra caribou, Arctic, northern of migratory, not forest-dwelling and sedentary like most woodland caribou ecotypes. It is unlike most woodland caribou in that it is not sedentary. Since the mid-1990s, the herd declined sharply and by 2010, it was reduced to 74,131\u2014a drop of up to 92%. [6] A 2011 survey confirms a continuing decline of the George River migratory caribou herd population. By 2014 the herd was estimated to be about to 14 200 [10] down from 27,600 in 2012, 74 131 in 2010 and 385 000 in 2001. [6] [124] [111] Leaf River caribou herd (LRCH) Caribou crossing Leaf River Leaf River and caribou The Leaf River caribou herd (LRCH), [140] another migratory forest-tundra ecotype of the boreal woodland caribou, near the coast of Hudson Bay , increased from 270 000 individuals in 1991 to 628 000 in 2001. [141] By 2011 the herd had decreased to 430 000 caribou. [111] [142] [143] According to an international study on caribou populations, the George River and Leaf River herds, and other herds that migrate from Nunavik, Quebec and insular Newfoundland, could be threatened with extinction by 2080. [124] Queen Charlotte Islands caribou Main article: Queen Charlotte Islands caribou The extinct Queen Charlotte Islands caribou ( R. t. dawsoni ) from the Queen Charlotte Islands was believed to represent a distinct subspecies. It became extinct at the beginning of the 20th century. However, recent DNA analysis from mitochondrial DNA of the remains from those reindeer suggest that the animals from the Queen Charlotte Islands were not genetically distinct from the Canadian mainland reindeer subspecies. [144] Alberta In Alberta's northwestern foothills, an area disturbed by decades of industrial development by the energy industry, the federal government set a target of leaving 65% of the habitat of the Little Smoky and a la Peche caribou herds undisturbed. By 2014 only 5% of their habitat remained undisturbed; the rest was crisscrossed with 16,000 kilometres of seismic lines cut for industry-related geological research in one 13,000 square kilometres section alone of these foothills. [145] and with bush roads, access roads connecting clearcuts and well pads. While clearly visible from an aerial view-such as is provided by Google Earth-and from the back roads, the deforestation and devastation is veiled by a curtain of forest that runs along the highways. Caribou depend on the cover of the forest for protection from wolf predation but the seismic lines destroy the places they usually hide. Wolves usually prefer to hunt moose and deer than the elusive, stealthy and fast-running caribou and their natural and ancient hunter/predator relationship was managed by the ecosystem itself. But seismic lines have destroyed the advantage they once had. Federal and provincial governments concerned about sustainable development and restoration, are waiting for the conclusion of the three-year study (2014-2017) undertaken by the Foothills Research Institute in Hinton, Alberta on human and animal land use in this area. [145] This study has already shown that the height of vegetation on the seismic trails may be one of the most contributing factors. As the height of vegetation decreased, the number of human motorized use-snowmobiles, Quads and ATV for example- increased. The lower the vegetation the harder it was for caribou to evade wolves. [145] According to the Alberta Caribou Committee, new and innovative industrial methods at the time of development will prevent degradation of habitat. For example, habitat is restored more rapidly with narrow (1.5-2.5) meandering seismic lines than traditional wide (8-m) straight lines. It is now possible to reduce or eliminate roads by using remote monitoring techniques for some types of oil and gas well sites. [146] Conservation and recovery Ongoing human development of caribou habitat has caused populations of woodland caribou to disappear from their original southern range. In particular, caribou were extirpated in many areas of eastern North America in the beginning of the 20th century. Woodland caribou were designated as threatened in 2002. [9] Environment Canada reported in 2011 that there were approximately 34,000 boreal caribou in 51 ranges remaining in Canada ( Environment Canada , 2011b). [147] Professor Marco Musiani of the University of Calgary, said in a statement that \"The woodland caribou is already an endangered species in southern Canada and the United States....[The] warming of the planet means the disappearance of their critical habitat in these regions. Caribou need undisturbed lichen-rich environments and these types of habitats are disappearing.\" [148] Woodland caribou have disappeared from most of their original southern range and were designated as threatened in 2002 by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). [9] Environment Canada reported in 2011 that there were approximately 34 000 boreal caribou in 51 ranges remaining in Canada.( Environment Canada , 2011b). [147] \"According to Geist, the \"woodland caribou is highly endangered throughout its distribution right into Ontario.\" [5] In 2002 the Atlantic-Gasp\u00e9sie population of the woodland caribou was designated as endangered by COSEWIC. The small isolated population of 200 animals was at risk from predation and habitat loss. In 1991 COSEWIC assigned \"endangered status\" to the Banks Island and High Arctic populations of Peary caribou. The Low Arctic population of Peary caribou was designated as threatened. By 2004 all three were designated as \"endangered.\" [149] In spite of voluntary hunting quotas\u2014for example in Sachs Harbour\u2014This caribou is a Canadian endemic subspecies. Numbers have declined by about 72% over the last three generations, mostly because of catastrophic die-off likely related to severe icing episodes. The ice covers the vegetation and caribou starve. Voluntary restrictions on hunting by local people are in place, but have not stopped population declines. Because of the continuing decline and expected changes in long-term weather patterns, this subspecies is at imminent risk of extinction. \u2014 COSEWIC 2004 According to IUCN Rangifer tarandus as a species is not endangered because of its overall large population and the widespread range. [1] However, in North America subspecies R. t. dawsoni is extinct . [149] [144] [150] R. t. pearyi is endangered, R. t. caribou are designated as threatened and some individual populations are endangered. While the subspecies R. t. granti and R. t. groenlandicus are not designated as threatened, many individual herds\u2014including some of the largest\u2014are declining and there is much concern at the local level. [111] Rangifer tarandus is \"endangered in Canada in regions such as south-east British Columbia at the Canadian-USA border, along the Columbia , Kootenay and Kootenai rivers and around Kootenay Lake . Rangifer tarandus is endangered in the United States in Idaho and Washington. There is strong regional variation in Rangifer herd size, By 2013 many caribou herds in North America had \"unusually low numbers\" and their winter ranges in particular were smaller than they used to be. [111] Caribou numbers have fluctuated historically, but many herds are in decline across their range. [151] There are many factors contributing to the decline in numbers. [152] Relationship with humans Humans started hunting caribou in the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods. Rangifer tarandus hunting by humans has a very long history, and they \"may well be the species of single greatest importance in the entire anthropological literature on hunting.\" [153] \"In North America and Eurasia the species has long been an important resource\u2014in many areas 'the' most important resource\u2014for peoples inhabiting the northern boreal forest and tundra regions. Known human dependence on caribou/wild reindeer has a long history, beginning in the Middle Pleistocene [154] [155] and continuing to the present.... The caribou/wild reindeer is thus an animal that has been a major resource for humans throughout a tremendous geographic area and across a time span of tens of thousands of years.\" [153] In the traditional lifestyle of the Inuit people, in particular the Caribou Inuit , Northern First Nations people, Alaska Natives , the caribou is an important source of food, clothing, shelter, and tools. The caribou vadzaih is the cultural symbol and a keystone subsistence species of the Gwich'in, just as the buffalo is to the Plains Indians. [156] Innovative language revitalization projects are underway to document the language, and to enhance the writing and translation skills of younger Gwich'in speakers. In one project lead research associate and fluent speaker Gwich\u2019in elder, Kenneth Frank, works with linguists which include young Gwich'in speakers affiliated with the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks to document traditional knowledge of caribou anatomy. [156] Elders have identified at least 150 descriptive Gwich'in names for all of the bones, organs, and tissues \"Associated with the caribou's anatomy are not just descriptive Gwich'in names for all of the body parts including bones, organs, and tissues as well as \"an encyclopedia of stories, songs, games, toys, ceremonies, traditional tools, skin clothing, personal names and surnames, and a highly developed ethnic cuisine.\" [156] First Nations and Inuit oral histories There is an Inuit saying from the Kivalliq region, [157] The caribou feeds the wolf, but it is the wolf who keeps the caribou strong. \u2014 Kivalliq region Elder Chief of Koyukuk and chair for the Western Arctic Caribou Herd Working Group, Benedict Jones or K\u2019ughto\u2019oodenool\u2019o\u2019 represents the Middle Yukon River , Alaska. His grandmother was a member of the Caribou Clan, who travelled with the caribou as a means to survive. In 1939, they were living the traditional life style at one of their hunting camps in Koyukuk near the location of what is now the Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge. His grandmother made a pair of new mukluks in one day. K\u2019ughto\u2019oodenool\u2019o\u2019 recounted story told by an elder, who \"worked on the steamboats during the gold rush days out on the Yukon.\" In late August the caribou migrated from the Alaska Range up north to Huslia , Koyukuk, and the Tanana area. One year the steamboat was unable to continue they ran into a caribou herd numbering estimated at a million animals, migrating across the Yukon. \"They tied up for seven days waiting for the caribou to cross. \"They ran out of wood for the steamboats, and had to go back down 40 miles to the wood pile to pick up some more wood. On the tenth day, they came back and they said there was still caribou going across the river night and day.\" [28] In mythology and art Among the Inuit, there is a story of the origin of the caribou, [158] Once upon a time there were no caribou on the earth. But there was a man who wished for caribou, and he cut a hole deep in the ground, and up this hole came caribou, many caribou. The caribou came pouring out, until the earth was almost covered with them. And when the man thought there were caribou enough for mankind, he closed up the hole again. Thus the caribou came up on earth. \u2014 Canada's Arctic 2002a Inuit artists from the barren lands, incorporate depictions of caribou\u2014and items made from caribou antler and skin\u2014 in carvings, drawings, prints and sculpture. Contemporary Canadian artist Brian Jungen 's, of Dunne-za First Nations ancestry, commissioned installation entitled \"The ghosts on top of my head\" (2010\u201311) in Banff, Alberta , depicts the antlers of caribou, elk and moose. [159] I remember a story my Uncle Jack told me \u2013 a Dunne-Za creation story about how animals once ruled the earth and were ten times their size and that got me thinking about scale and using the idea of the antler, which is a thing that everyone is scared of, and making it into something more approachable and abstract. \u2014 Brian Jungen 2011 Tomson Highway , CM [160] is a Canadian and Cree playwright , novelist , and children's author, who was born in a remote area north of Brochet , Manitoba . [160] His father, Joe Highway, was a caribou hunter. His 2001 children's book entitled Caribou Song/at\u00edhko n\u00edkamon was selected as one of the \"Top 10 Children\u2019s Books\" by the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail . The young protagonists of Caribou Song , like Tomson himself, followed the caribou herd with their families. Canadian icon The Canadian 25-cent coin, or \" quarter \" features a depiction of a caribou on one face. The caribou is the official provincial animal of Newfoundland and Labrador , Canada, and appears on the coat of arms of Nunavut . A caribou statue was erected at the center of the Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial, marking the spot in France where hundreds of soldiers from Newfoundland were killed and wounded in the First World War and there is a replica in Bowring Park, in St. John's, Newfoundland's capital city. [161] The caribou is also the symbol of Newfoundland's Qalipu Mi'kmaq First Nation Band founded in 2009. As noted above, the word caribou is derived from the Mi'kmaw term qalipu (prounced kah- li -bu). See also List of Wildlife Species at Risk (Canada) Rangifer (journal) Rangifer (constellation) Hypoderma tarandi Cephenemyia trompe Notes ^ According to Inuit elder, Marie Kilunik of the Aivilingmiut, Canadian Inuit preferred the caribou skins from caribou taken in the late summer of fall when their coats had thickened. They used for winter clothing \"because each hair is hollow and fills with air trapping heat.\"(Marie Kilunik, Aivilingmiut, Crnkovich 1990:116). ^ The Integrated Taxonomic Information System list Wilson and Geist on their experts panel. ^ The George River and Leaf River caribou herds are classified as woodland but are also migratory with tundra as their primary range ^ Grubb (2005) argued that these North American the R. t. dawsoni subspecies in the woodland caribou division, that the R. t. osborni subspecies in the \"Populations transitional between caribou and tarandus division\" and the subspecies R. t. caboti , R. t. groenlandicus , R. t. pearsoni and R. t. terraenovae in the Tarandus division, barren-ground caribou and the subspecies R. t. pearyi in the Platyrhynchus division should be considered valid based on Banfield (Banfield) and considerably modified by Geist (1998). Banfield rejected this classification in 1961. However, Valerius Geist and others considered it valid.

It will take a few years for the Taiwanese semiconductor behemoth to transition to the more advanced node, but we should start seeing 1.4nm chips in the distant future, as the company has said that it will kick off production for the latter in 2028. Naturally, there will be significant benefits to transitioning to this manufacturing process, so let us jump into the details immediately. New process to make 1.4nm chips is called A14 or 14-Angstrom node, and is specifically designed for sub-2nm technology The announcement was made during TSMC\u2019s North America Technology Symposium in Santa Clara, California, with the firm\u2019s CEO, C.C. Wei, stating that \u2018our customers\u2019 are constantly looking into the future. In its quest to develop \u2018state of the art\u2019 wafers for a multitude of customers, TSMC\u2019s only rival in this space is Samsung. However, we recently reported that the Korean giant had cancelled its own version of 1.4nm for undisclosed reasons. Related Story TSMC Breaks Silence On Reports It Shipped Advanced AI Chips To China\u2019s Huawei On the plus side, the company was later reported to have established a team laser-focused on 1nm chip development, with a mass production target set for 2029 . Assuming Samsung sticks to its intended timeline, it can provide some competition to TSMC, leading to negotiable prices for this technology, but for the time being, the focus is likely on increasing those 2nm yields. As for the benefits of customers placing 1.4nm wafers orders, Nikkei Asia reports that the A14 node can deliver 15 percent improved performance and a 30 percent reduction in power consumption. There is currently no information regarding which client hinted at being the first to place orders for these 1.4nm chips, but we have a hunch that Apple\u2019s close business relationship with TSMC and its ability to procure massive wafer shipments will make the deal between the two a major priority. Aside from introducing its A14 technology in 2028, TSMC also mentioned that it will introduce next-generation packaging technology that combines a bevy of chips with different functions into a single package, with production expected to begin in 2027.

Menu Close Every few years, I install Linux on my computer, use it for a few weeks, give up, and go crawling back to my Mac. Also, every few years, I move all my writing, journaling, note-taking, and task management to fully analog systems powered by paper and pen. I use my analog systems for a few weeks, give up, and go crawling back to the digital apps I\u2019ve been using for the last decade. My urge to use Linux and my urge to eschew computers altogether both come from the same place: I believe the companies that make our computers and the accompanying software are unethical, exploitative, and harmful to society. Using their products makes me uncomfortable, as if I\u2019m complicit in the harms they\u2019re causing. Running Linux on my computers is a way for me to opt out of giving money and lending legitimacy to these businesses. Switching to analog systems allows me to opt out of computing altogether. Why am I in this state of tension with computer products when I use a multitude of non-computer products made by corporations that cause much more harm to people and nature? I drive a Hyundai car, shop at Reliance stores, wear clothing made by Zara. Why am I not concerned about the poor behavior of these other organizations? It\u2019s not like they\u2019re any better than Google, Microsoft, or Apple. Honestly, the reason is not entirely rational. The connection I have with my computer when I\u2019m programming in my IDE or writing in my favorite writing app is the same connection a musician might have with their favorite guitar, or a tennis player with their racquet. It\u2019s something sublime, something spiritual. When I\u2019m using my computer to create something, when I\u2019m in that state of flow, I forget where my mind and body end and where the computer begins. A melding of human and machine takes place. It\u2019s greater than the sum of its parts \u2014 the stuff of cyberpunk dreams. It hurts me to know that the tools I share such a deep connection with are made by corporations that exploit workers in developing countries, greenwash their products while generating tons of electronic waste, fight against the rights of people to repair their possessions, engage in malicious compliance when governments try to regulate them, spy on their users, hold their users\u2019 data hostage, and commit a long list of other crimes that would take too long to recount here. To make matters worse, these corporations openly and gleefully disrespect art and the tools used to make it while indulging in vulgar displays of power over artists and their work. I understand that my switching to Linux won\u2019t really fix the basic problem that large corporations are bad for society. As long as I\u2019m using a computer, I\u2019m complicit to some degree in the harms caused by the technology industry. But I believe, maybe naively, that using libre software is at least a tiny bit better for the world compared to proprietary software. And of course, if I can get away from using computers entirely for some or all of my work, I can opt out completely from the snakepit of deception and exploitation that is Silicon Valley, wash my hands of the whole bloody affair, and finally stop being complicit in destroying the planet and society. But at least for now, my life does not permit me to walk away from the digital prison I\u2019m trapped in. Maintaining a Linux system or using pen and paper to manage my life both require more spoons than I possess at the moment. The tyranny of convenience has all of us in its grip, and I\u2019m no exception. I understand that this is entirely my own failing. We\u2019ve structured our society so that the best products and services are made by the worst people in the world. Of course you can deliver packages earlier than everyone else if you overwork your employees. Of course you can sell the fastest computers at the cheapest prices if you keep moving your manufacturing operations to countries with the worst labor and environmental laws. Of course you can build the smartest AI models if you slurp up everybody else\u2019s intellectual property without asking for consent first. It makes little difference to how tech businesses operate when a smattering of concerned individuals opt out of using their products and services. Things will only change when democratically elected governments across the world step in with regulation, drag Big Tech through the courts, and fine them billions of dollars. Things will only change when being an asshole stops being a competitive advantage. Until that day arrives, I have to learn to live in a state of tension with my tools. I have to acknowledge and accept the fact that I use tools built by awful people to create beautiful things.", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://ankursethi.com/blog/the-tools-i-love-are-made-by-awful-people/", "source": "Ankursethi.com", "published_at": "2025-04-24T04:12:13"}, {"id": 524, "title": "How Investors Can Cash In on a Green Tech Boom in Emerging Markets", "content": "How Investors Can Cash In on a Green Tech Boom in Emerging Markets Why is Slate Auto pricing its electric pickup so low?

Follow: Donald Trump See your latest updates Donald Trump holds up a copy of his 1987 book, \"The Art of the Deal\" during a town hall event at Pinkerton Academy in Derry, New Hampshire, on August 19, 2015. Mary Schwalm/AP/File CNN \u2014 \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d opens with an exhausting fly-on-the-wall account of a week in the life of Donald Trump the real-estate shark. He\u2019s never still, always on the phone and cranking out deal-after-deal with big business pals. The president hoped the first 100 days of his second term would uncork a similar torrent of dealmaking as depicted in the seminal text of Trumpism. But Trump has softened his tone on his trade war with China; he blinked over reciprocal tariffs on dozens of other nations; and he is fast losing patience with the Ukraine war , which he had predicted he\u2019d end in 24 hours . Deals are proving more elusive when the stakes are not skyscrapers and casinos but entire economies, the credibility of powerful foreign leaders and national sovereignty. Trump\u2019s belief that every policy issue is a win-lose proposition has dominated his return to the White House \u2013 and has led to some nominal successes. He\u2019s worked out, for example, how to use his considerable executive authority as leverage against an adversary. By threatening to cut security clearances, he won concessions from some top law firms . By brandishing billions of dollars in government funding, he flexed power over several top universities . This is all ethically and constitutionally questionable. But it\u2019s all about chalking up \u201cwins.\u201d Trump\u2019s fellow businessmen understand the game. The president offered an opt-out from 145% Chinese tariffs to iPhones following an \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d-style call with Apple CEO Tim Cook. But the president is also finding out that geopolitics and global trade negotiations have little in common with selling a condo. China and Ukraine resist Trump\u2019s pressure So far, the endless stream of stunning trade deals predicted by the president\u2019s staff after he paused many tariffs for 90 days hasn\u2019t materialized . China has balked at being bullied. And despite the president\u2019s growing fury, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky has refused so far to accept onerous US conditions for ending the war started by Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2013 who has received no such pressure. If Trump does pull a fair peace deal out of the hat in Ukraine, he\u2019ll potentially save tens of thousands of lives and end three years of vicious killing. If he can rebalance US trade with China, he\u2019ll go some way to redressing economic injustices in industrialized regions gutted by globalization. None of these initiatives are closed. But they are all testing the core mythology of Trump as dealmaker that is crucial to his political appeal. He caricatured his own approach taken to its logical and cruel extremes earlier this year when he suggested moving Gaza\u2019s entire population of more than 2 million people out of the territory devastated by Israel\u2019s war with Hamas. He promised that this feat of ethnic cleansing would allow the US to build the \u201cRiviera of the Middle East\u201d with no thought of the dignity and sovereignty of Palestinians. Not surprisingly, his hopes for forging Middle East peace have stalled. Trump steps back on his China trade war China\u2019s President Xi Jinping doesn\u2019t do diplomacy by phone. Beijing\u2019s preference for formal, painstaking lower-level talks among officials before presidents meet means Trump\u2019s approach to his China trade war was questionable from the start \u2013 as was the idea that Xi would bend following the humiliation of facing 145% tariffs that Trump slapped on Chinese goods. After all, his nationalist political project is based on remaking a world that he regards as unfairly shaped by American power.

Costfoto/NurPhoto/Getty Images Almost all US presidents over the last 20 years have been frustrated at China\u2019s refusal to open its markets to US products, among other issues, including Chinese intellectual property theft. Intimidating Beijing might have worked 25 years ago. But China is now a superpower. It can hurt the US as much as the US can hurt China. \u201cI think the Chinese are going to feel vindicated,\u201d Richard Haass, president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt. \u201cWe imposed tariffs on China; China pushed back with large tariffs of their own. It looks to be the United States that is backing down. From China\u2019s point of view, this is how they hoped it would play out.\u201d Beijing\u2019s refusal to blink was predictable, although the White House, which seems to lack expertise on China, appeared surprised. \u201cIf a negotiated solution is truly what the US wants, it should stop threatening and blackmailing China and seek dialogue based on equality, respect and mutual benefit,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said Wednesday. \u201cTo keep asking for a deal while exerting extreme pressure is not the right way to deal with China and simply will not work.\u201d Trump\u2019s statements on Tuesday and Wednesday that tariffs wouldn\u2019t stay near 145% and that he wouldn\u2019t play \u201chardball\u201d with Xi were a clear change of emphasis from a White House that had been demanding a call from the Chinese leader. It comes amid rising political pressure in the US \u2013 not least from tanking stock markets destabilized by Trump\u2019s tariff policies, which have crushed the 401(k) pension plans of many Americans. Next year\u2019s midterm elections are already spooking GOP lawmakers. Trump just met with CEOs who warned of supply chain crunches and shortages if China tariffs stay high. And a new Pew Research poll found Wednesday that the president\u2019s approval rating has slumped to 40% \u2014 down 7 percentage points since early February. China might have learned from the previous episode of Trump\u2019s tariff war, which was marked by an earlier climbdown. Earlier this month, the president paused reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries only hours after they\u2019d come into force. He admitted he\u2019d been watching alarming developments in the bond market as America\u2019s reputation as a safe investment haven came under severe pressure. The White House saved face on that occasion by arguing that scores of nations were lining up with attractive trade deals to bring to the president. But so far, no final agreements have emerged. Genuine trade deals typically take years to negotiate, since they require politicians of all sides to make painful political concessions on issues that often impact powerful constituencies. The US is, for example, insisting that Europe open its markets to US meats from hormone-raised livestock, a concession EU leaders would struggle to impose on their voters. Despite the evidence of China\u2019s hardline statecraft, Trump still appears convinced that what he calls his \u201cgreat relationship\u201d with Xi will unlock a deal quickly. \u201cEverything\u2019s active. Everybody wants to be a part of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday. Hours later however, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is being credited with masterminding Trump\u2019s walk back on tariffs laid out a less optimistic timeline for meaningful change in trade with China. He spoke of a \u201ctwo- to three-year timeline for the full rebalancing\u201d of the relationship \u2013 in a scenario that would require Beijing\u2019s cooperation.

Pang Xinglei/Xinhua News Agency/Getty Images The White House insists that Trump\u2019s policy is working already. It regularly publishes lists of incoming investment to the United States. It\u2019s true that some nations are using such inflows to impress the president. But this might also signal that they think they can buy him off with flashy headlines without fundamentally altering the character of their full trading relationship. Still, many Trump supporters retain their belief in his mystical dealmaking powers. \u201cTrump is an incredibly strategic negotiator. He\u2019s the best there is, \u201c former Trump adviser Stephen Moore told CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar. \u201cEventually \u2026 they (China) will come to the negotiating table and the US will come out ahead in this negotiation because the situation is so unlevel right now.\u201d Ukraine pushes back at US pressure Trump\u2019s attempts to impose his vision and will on Ukraine mean that his efforts to forge a peace deal have been as unsuccessful as his trade wars. As with China, some of his approaches appear not to appreciate the political forces acting on foreign leaders. The president, for instance, expressed frustration with Zelensky on Wednesday because of his failure to sign up to a US-drafted agreement that appears to lock in many of Russia\u2019s goals while compromising Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty. \u201cThe situation for Ukraine is dire \u2014 He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cWe are very close to a Deal, but the man with \u2018no cards to play\u2019 should now, finally, GET IT DONE.\u201d On Thursday, Trump criticized the Russian president, saying he was \u201cnot happy\u201d after Russia launched its deadliest wave of attacks on Kyiv in nine months. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president\u2019s \u201cpatience is running very thin.\u201d She added, \u201cHe needs to see this thing come to an end.\u201d Trump is angry about Zelensky\u2019s opposition to America\u2019s proposed recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea \u2013 a region annexed illegally by Putin in 2014. Yuriy Boyechko, CEO of Hope for Ukraine, a nonprofit organization, explained such a move would be politically impossible for Zelensky. \u201cThe only way it can be done is through a change of (the) Ukrainian constitution, and to get that done, referendums need to take place; the Ukrainian Parliament has to approve this amendment to the constitution; and (Ukraine\u2019s) highest court has to rectify this before Crimea can be recognized as Russian territory.\u201d Boyechko added, \u201cSurrendering Ukrainian territory to Russian occupiers will never be ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament and the Ukrainian people will never vote for it.\u201d The US approach comes after weeks Trump repeatedly escalated pressure on Ukraine while bringing his plans more closely in line with Russia\u2019s goals, a process accelerated by US envoy Steve Witkoff\u2019s frequent visits to Putin. The administration is also trying to negotiate a deal to exploit Ukraine\u2019s rare earth mineral resources, which critics have likened to economic colonization of a vulnerable nation. While Trump is angry at Ukraine, he\u2019s convinced Putin is ready to deal \u2013 despite a lack of evidence that he\u2019d compromise any of his goals to eventually destroy Ukrainian independence. \u201cI think Russia is ready. I think we have a deal with Russia,\u201d Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office, once again empathizing with the aggressor rather than the victim of the conflict. At the start of \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d Trump wrote that while other people paint beautifully or write wonderful poetry, \u201cdeals are my art form.\u201d The world is wondering whether he\u2019s lost his touch.

Home AV News Editorials Samsung UWB May Revolutionize Lossless/Wireless Headphones: But For Who? Samsung UWB May Revolutionize Lossless/Wireless Headphones: But For Who? by Wayde Robson \u2014 April 24, 2025 Samsung patents UWB headphones & earbuds Ultra-Wideband (UWB) is a radio technology with a long history dating back to the earliest experiments by Heinrich Hertz in the 1880s. But digital applications are where we see UWB's greatest potential. Today, UWB has been making waves thanks to its fine ranging capabilities featured in some Apple iOS and Samsung Galaxy smartphones\u2014an area being standardized by the FiRa Consortium. Using UWB signals, the smartphone can track an object attached to another UWB transceiver to within 4-inches (10-cm). The feature has been popularized thanks to relatively inexpensive UWB chips found in the small, keychain sized Apple AirTags and Samsung SmartTags. Apple's U1 UWB chip is cheap enough to stick into AirTags and sell for a the uncharacteristically low price of just $30. It's a little disappointing to see Apple, the company that sells a $130 USB cable, not asking at least $99.99 for an AirTag. But low-cost UWB transceiver chips could mean that more companies are looking into UWB and investing in what may come next from the technology. With UWB chips already turning smartphones into tracking devices, audiophiles are eager for the next UWB implementation in high-bandwidth wireless streaming. According to its theoretical capabilities the technology has the potential to over-air stream uncompressed, lossless & hi-res LPCM directly to a pair of wireless headphones. But despite rumors and recent advances by UWB tech engineers, we\u2019re still waiting for proper Ultra-WideBand (UWB) wireless headphones that can playback music using your smartphone as source, free of dongles and other third party attachments that will repel mainstream consumers like an improvisational jazz playlist. Samsung, the South Korean tech giant that\u2019s already using UWB tracking in its smartphones recently filed a patent offering a glimmer of hope that this time, the wireless revolution may be just around the corner. Samsung to Enter UWB The South Korean technology juggernaut\u2019s patent appears fit the requirements of audiophiles and average tech consumers alike by bringing UWB wireless audio to headphones or earbuds using a smartphone as source without intermediary devices. Although we\u2019ve been disappointed by rumors of pending UWB audio breakthroughs before, but with Samsung there\u2019s reason for optimism. The company that builds everything from washing machines to oil tankers is perhaps better known for its Galaxy smartphone line. Since acquiring Harman in 2016, Samsung\u2019s commitment to high-performance audio is bigger than most independent audio companies. Even before the Harman acquisition Samsung had already built a sophisticated audio R&D lab in California and poached top Harman engineer, Allan Devantier to run it with a mandate to; \u201c... take Samsung\u2019s audio technology to the top of the industry. \u201d It seems inevitable that Samsung\u2019s UWB headphone research will bring high-performance wireless audio to its Galaxy mobile ecosystem. Pros/Cons of Functional UWB Audio As a radio technology, Ultra WideBand (UWB) is unique in the way it sends pulses rather than continuous sine waves like AM/FM or Bluetooth. Its pulses of radio energy can be sent at speeds up to 2-nano-seconds apart, making UWB a natural fit for virtually lag free data transmissions. The \u201cwide\u201d in ultra WideBand refers to its operation at an ultra-wide range of frequencies from 3.1 through 10.6-GHz through which it sends its pulses. When used for short-range communication it can act as a Personal Area Network (PAN), similar to Bluetooth or NFC while operating on comparatively very low power, making it well-suited for battery powered portable devices. UWB has a similar optimal range to Bluetooth\u2014at about 10 meters or 32 feet between devices\u2014but its latency is dramatically lower, measured in nanoseconds instead of milliseconds. UWB latency can be less than 5-ns compared to Bluetooth\u2019s 34-to-200-ms. This incredibly low latency means a virtually lag-free sync for audio/video applications. The result is video free of those lip-sync issues that make anything you watch look like a foreign film voice-over. But employing UWB for portable audio is not without its challenges. Perhaps the biggest barrier is in UWB's high frequencies that making its signals susceptible to interference from actual physical barriers like walls. This problem isn\u2019t unique to Ultra-WideBand, all radio frequencies greater than 6.5-GHz are susceptible to absorption by walls and especially water-rich materials, and that's a serious problem for wearable audio systems. Transmitting UWB to your headphones from a phone in your back pocket can create a situation UWB engineers call \u201cbody blocking\u201d. That\u2019s when UWB\u2019s signals must pass-through what one Star Trek Next-Gen episode's crystalline aliens derisively call our \u201cugly bags of mostly water\u201d, our own bodies can destabilize the connection. STNG Episode: Home Soil. High freq crystalline entities operating at high freqs frustrated by \"body blocking\" There are now workaround for body blocking that don\u2019t involve increasing signal power. A company called Antennaware has developed body blocking solutions for various close-range RF designs and in 2022 the company launched a BodyWave antenna to help wearable UWB devices overcome drop-outs and inconsistent connections. Audio Data Rates: Bluetooth vs. UWB Red Book\u2019s CD-quality audio, widely held as the gold standard for lossless hi-fi recordings, streams at a bit-depth and frequency of 16-bit/44.1kHz LPCM and requires data-speeds up to 1.4-megabits per-second (Mbps). Not even today\u2019s most advanced Bluetooth codecs can match it, including Qualcomm\u2019s aptX Lossless or Sony\u2019s LDAC, which peak at 1.2-Mbps and 990-kbps respectively. UWB can out-pace both Bluetooth codecs simultaneously with one arm tied behind its back. According to the Telecommunication Engineering Center, in theory UWB: \u201c...supports a bit rate greater than 100 Mbps within a 10-meter radius for wireless personal area communications.\u201d Qualcomm aptX Lossless broke the Bluetooth 1Mbps barrier - but still compressed! Even if practical consumer-grade chip designs only use a fraction of that 100-Mbps capability, UWB has the potential to far exceed Red Book CD-quality and easily handle 24-bit/192-kHz hi-res FLAC files that can chew through just under 10-Mbps. But\u2026You Can\u2019t Even Hear the Difference! Before telling me that human ears can\u2019t perceive the benefits in high-resolution audio, I know. In most situations you\u2019re right. But if a higher bandwidth option is available at a sufficiently trivial cost difference \u2014 count me in! Bluetooth always introduces compression that I\u2019d prefer to avoid. Although, the technology's capability is no guarantee that every UWB implementation will be compression-free, we\u2019ll have to judge results on a case-by-case basis. Of course, looking forward to a new higher data-rate wireless technology takes nothing away from the advances made in Bluetooth technology. Qualcomm and Sony\u2019s codecs have surpassed sound quality most of us would have thought possible. They perform remarkably using a wireless protocol developed in 1994 specifically to de-clutter desktop computer mouse and keyboard cables. But from what we can see of Samsung\u2019s UWB headphone patent, the humble Bluetooth codec may continue to play an important role. Samsung UWB Audio Patent The patent filed on Jan, 30 2025 includes diagrams of both over-ear headphones and in-ear monitors (earbuds) using UWB. Samsung's plan appears to harness Bluetooth\u2019s well-established infrastructure in some way. Figure 2 indicates that the UWB connection involves an initial Bluetooth connection between the source device and a single primary earphone before the UWB connection is established to that primary then a second UWB connection is made to the secondary earphone to complete a stereo UWB network. Then Bluetooth disconnects, leaving the user with pure UWB sound quality. Samsung US Patent Diagram Connection instructions beginning with Bluetooth connection to one earphone. Idle speculation: It's possible Bluetooth\u2019s role in establishing the UWB connection helps save energy by only turning on UWB when requested. Samsung's patent will no doubt result in its own proprietary UWB format and I hope it takes off. But perhaps a future collaboration or a UWB consortium will help to fully develop the technology's broad use across the consumer electronics industry. It'd be nice to see UWB one day become as ubiquitous as Bluetooth today. UWB Home Audio Speakers The Samsung diagram with its UWB connection between earcups is not unlike a recent Focal/NAIM development. Focal\u2019s new high-end powered speaker system, Diva Utopia is a rare practical application of UWB audio already in commercial use today. Diva Utopia uses UWB in a wireless 24-bit/96-kHz connection between the two speakers, but that\u2019s where similarities to a portable headphone application ends. At 141-lbs the Divas are anything but portable, these Divas will require your full-time attention if you tried to take them anywhere. While Diva Utopia can receive audio from Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a variety of hard-wired options including HDMI eARC, they\u2019re not designed for a UWB source. But if I ever found myself streaming music in Bluetooth to these speakers, I'd feel ripped off! Focal Diva Utopia powered speakers w/ NAIM electronics: Featuring hi-res wireless cross-speaker UWB at 24-bit/96-kHz. The Spark Microsystems UWB chip that Focal/NAIM chose for the Diva Utopias creates a compelling use case for UWB audio. The wireless L/R speaker communication uses Spark\u2019s SR1020 radio chip capable of data-rates of up to 10Mbps over a secure and relatively noise-free, high-band spectrum from 6-GHz to 9.1-GHz. Unfulfilled Rumors of UWB Headphones It's Feb. 2023 and legendary speaker company PSB announces the development of a wireless UWB headphone in partnership with MQA and Sonical, providing an estimated release in Q1 2024. A lot happened in the intervening months, but the PSB UWB headphones did not ship. Things weren\u2019t looking good for MQA during the course of 2023. Premium music streamer and MQA-booster, Tidal had already been replacing its MQA library with true lossless and hi-res FLAC files, moving away from MQA\u2019s compressed streaming algorithm. Tidal\u2019s transfer to FLAC would be complete in the summer 2024 and Tidal users rejoiced. By this time, MQA had already been taking criticism as audio enthusiast measurements around the Internet revealed that it wasn't exactly a pristine lossless format . We don't know if being jilted by Tidal had anything to do with it, but MQA filed for bankruptcy only about a month after PSB\u2019s UWB headphone announcement. PSB\u2019s UWB headphone launch may have seemed cursed, but in a surprise move, the speaker company's parent, Lenbrook purchased MQA in late 2023. Sonical still seems like a reliable partner for developing UWB audio technology as it has continues building momentum in that space, so maybe the collaboration will be resurrected someday. But for now, the PSB\u2019s press-announcement now returns a 404 error. We can only assume the project is on hold indefinitely. Three caballeros collaborate. But so far, no UWB headphones. Apple UWB Audio, Denied! Online sleuths were teased by Apple way back in 2022 when buzz in headphone communities suggested that Apple may be first to break into UWB audio, and there was plenty of evidence for those of us who \u2014 wanted to believe! Apple has a high-tech audio lab of its own, overseen by Apple VP of Acoustics, Gary Geaves. The iPhone 11's U1 UWB chip was already two years old and its AirTag feature proved a solid hit for Apple, everyone from chronic car-key misplacers to underhanded car thieves all found it useful. Samsung Galaxy SmartTag & Apple AirTag Then, in Sept 2022 Apple VP of Acoustics, Gary Geaves dropped evidence for a UWB audio implementation in an interview where he said: \u201c...so we have to concentrate very hard on squeezing the most that we can out of the Bluetooth technology, and there\u2019s a number of tricks we can play to maximise or get around some of the limits of Bluetooth. But it\u2019s fair to say that we would like more bandwidth and\u2026 I\u2019ll stop right there. We would like more bandwidth\u201d, he smiles. Keep in mind that at the time of the quote, Apple Music had just relaunched its entire library in lossless and hi-res. Many of us expected Apple was finally going to raise the bar on its wireless sound quality. Apple\u2019s wireless audio had far too long ignored advances in Bluetooth, even in its premium $500 wireless headphone, AirPods Max. Apple Music may have gone lossless/hi-res, but its own wireless hardware was stuck with a 30-year old Bluetooth codec, AAC that peaks at a lossy 256-kbps. Apple optimists were certain that a future iPhone UWB chip would deliver the bandwidth Geaves was looking for, assuming it would bring lossless/hi-res to new Apple headphones. But Apple\u2019s market research may have disagreed with investing in the R&D merely Apple Music's lossless 2-Channel sound. ABC News crew breaches tight security at Apple HQ Audio Labs Our hopes for streaming Apple UWB audio were dashed with the launch of a new pair of AirPods. The model, confusingly named AirPods Pro 2 w/ USB-C arrived in Sept. 2023 with a new H2 chip capable of receiving lossless over-air audio. But Apple accomplished this feat without one pulse of UWB. Instead Apple did the work of cutting its very own wireless protocol from whole cloth. An incredible feat of brute-force engineering, but not UWB. The Apple H2 chip runs a proprietary 5-GHz wireless protocol capable of streaming Apple\u2019s lossless ALAC codec at an unusual but effective resolution of 20-bit/48-kHz. That\u2019s a true lossless stream and technically hi-res, Apple seems to have taken my own advice from 2021 by developing over-air ALAC streaming . The Apple-user dream of wire-free true lossless hi-fi had finally come to pass, but with a high-priced catch! First, the 48-kHz audio sample rate Apple routinely uses in its ecosystem, including in the new H2 protocol may imply an intention for digital video and film, even if its perfectly suited for lossless/hi-res music. The Audio Engineering Society (AES) and Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) both adopted 48-kHz as a digital audio standard for professional video. The catch is that the new AirPods Pro 2 USB won\u2019t stream Apple\u2019s lossless ALAC music files from your iPhone. For now, the only way to access ALAC with the new AirPods is to connect them to Apple\u2019s Vision Pro VR headset. Yes, you can still pair the AirPods Pro 2 USB to your iPhone, but you\u2019ll only stream AAC. It\u2019s a fair prediction that future iPhones will transmit Apple\u2019s wireless 5-GHz protocol to the new AirPods Pro2 USB, along with a new line of Apple wireless audio products including a new Lossless AirPod Max. I'd be surprised if engineers at Apple aren't already hard at work on a new, more energy efficient 5-Ghz chip for new iOS devices. So it appears that Geaves\u2019 desire for \u201cmore bandwidth\u201d was less about 2-channel hi-fi audio and more about DSP. Apple surely does its market research before a major project like creating its own proprietary wireless protocol. The company may have anticipated demand for a low-latency, binaural rendition of Spatial Audio in a Vision Pro accessory that it hopes will bring personal home theater to the masses. There is likely no groundswell of Apple-users chomping at the bit for wireless ALAC from Apple Music. But when iPhones can stream its 5-gHz wireless protocol it will likely be strategically released alongside a new line of AirPods featuring a new H3 chip. Conclusion For now, I'll hold out hope that Samsung nails UWB audio, even if only used in its Galaxy ecosystem at first. Hopefully it's open to licensing and competition from other manufacturers that further secures Android as the platform of choice for wireless digital audio. If a future line of Harman's AKG, JBL or HK headphones were released featuring Samsung's UWB, I'll definitely want to give them listen. But like Apple's proprietary format, a Galaxy UWB will likely focus squarely on wireless AV-entertainment in a Dolby Atmos or spatial audio DSP, with only a side-order of lossless 2-channel audio. But, to strain an Adam Smith metaphor: The rising tide of digital-throughput raises all sonic boats. As long as you can turn off DSP, I\u2019d try any UWB implementation that can deliver uncompressed lossless 2-channel audio to a good pair of wireless headphones, free of dongles and other third party attachments. I might even decide to try out an improvisational jazz playlist.

Having gone on sale in its domestic market last month, the all-electric SUV is now on show at Auto Shanghai 2025 . Sitting below the C10 in the automaker\u2019s product portfolio, the B10 is due to head to Europe in the near future and will eventually be heading to Malaysia. Measuring in at 4,515 mm long, 1,855 mm wide and 1,655 mm tall, with a 2,735 mm-long wheelbase, the C-segment offering follows the general styling template of the larger C-series, with a front end that features a closed-off fascia and a slim bridging strip joining the headlights. At the back, the theme continues, with design accents including a horizontal light bar strip joining the rear light assemblies. In China, the B10 is available in five variant forms, with the base variant featuring a rear electric motor offering 177 hp (179 PS, or 132 kW) and 175 Nm of torque. A 56.2 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery provides the base model with 510 km of travel on a single charge based on the CLTC standard, which translates to about 420 km of WLTP-rated range. Performance figures include a 0-100 km/h time of 9.3 seconds. The other variants get a more powerful electric motor putting out 215 hp (218 PS, or 160 kW) and 240 Nm Versions with the 56.2 kWh battery offer an identical 510 km CLTC range, but a higher capacity 67.1 kWh LFP unit provides 600 km of CLTC-rated range (or around 490 km WLTP). In any case, the 0-100 km/h sprint time for the higher output B10 drops to 6.8 seconds. In terms of charging, the automaker says it takes about 4.2 hours to charge the smaller battery from 30-80%, or 5.6 hours for the larger battery via the AC route at a max rate of 11 kW. With an 800V electrical architecture, the B10 supports DC fast charging that can get the battery from 30 to 80% state-of-charge in around 19 minutes for the 56.2 kWh unit, or 20 minutes for the 67.1 kWh pack. Like the B01 EV sedan that made its global debut at today at Auto Shanghai, the B10 is underpinned by the automaker\u2019s LEAP 3.5 platform. According to the automaker, the B10\u2019s chassis has been co-developed with Stellantis to deliver superior handling and comfort. Technical highlights include a newly optimised steering angle algorithm and an integrated braking system to offer a smoother and more energy-efficient driving experience. Like the larger C10 features the brand\u2019s CTC 2.0 (Cell-to-Chassis) technology, which features custom-designed, floor-mounted low-profile battery cells Aside from providing additional cabin space and enhanced structural integration, it allows improved fast-charging efficiency to be obtained. Inside, you\u2019ll find a cleanly presented cockpit featuring an 8.8-inch digital instrument cluster and a 14.6-inch 2.5K high-definition touchscreen infotainment display, with a Qualcomm Snapdragon SA8155 chip powering a Leapmotor OS 4.0 Plus operating system. Unlike the C10, the B10 gets Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity from the get-go. Available equipment for the B10 includes a 12-speaker Leapmotor sound system, a panoramic glass roof, single-zone climate control, 256-colour ambient lighting, wireless charger, a powered tailgate and Oeko-Tex faux leather upholstery on higher spec variants. Boot space is 420 litres, but folding down the rear seats brings the volume up to 1,415 litres. Higher-end variants feature a full ADAS suite with 26 functions, with a Qualcomm SA8650 driving chip being supported by an array of cameras, ultrasonic radars, millimetre wave radars and a roof-mounted lidar sensor. All versions also get automatic parking as standard. In China, launch prices for the B10 went from 109,800 to 139,800 yuan (about RM66,100 to RM84,200), pricing that suggests the SUV could be very competitive when it eventually gets here. It has already been earmarked for Malaysia via the CKD route, as indicated last week during the signing ceremony for the local assembly of Leapmotor models , which is set to begin with production of the C10 by the end of 2025.

In line with the previous iterations, it arrives as a minor update for the iPhone with similar features in tow. Alongside, it bundles fixes for a bug that caused black screen to appear on the new Apple Vision Pro app in some cases, alongside other known issues. Shortly after, Apple also released the iOS 18.5 Public Beta 2 update with a handful of changes compared to the publicly available iOS 18.4.1 version. iOS 18.5 Developer Beta 3 and Public Beta 2 Updates: What's New As per Apple, both iOS 18.5 Developer Beta 3 and Public Beta 2 updates carry similar changes to the Developer Beta 1 update which Apple released earlier this month. There's a new option for toggling Contact Photos right from the Mail app's UI, by tapping the three-dot option from the top-right corner of the screen. While the same functionality was previously available via the Settings app, the update adds a new shortcut in the Mail app too. Users can also turn off Group by Sender, categories, and AI priority messages options in the app by invoking the same three-dot menu. There are visual enhancements to the AppleCare and Warranty Coverage page and a new banner for AppleCare coverage now appears in the Settings app. It enables them to learn more about the coverage they've purchased by tapping the link. Apple says iPhone users can also manage their AppleCare plan by heading over to their Apple Account and selecting a device from the device list. Madhav Sheth Joins Nxtcell to Lead Alcatel's Re-Entry to Indian Market Alongside the features, there are a handful of bug fixes too. As per the Cupertino-based tech giant, the latest updates bring a fix for an issue affecting the Apple Vision Pro app that caused it to launch with a black screen when downloaded from the App Store. They also fix a previously existing issue where the availability of C APIs, which provide direct access to system resources and hardware functionalities within the hvf framework, was not being properly checked. Another bug that was previously discovered and rectified was related to the StoreKit, a framework used by developers to provide features and services for their apps and in-app purchases via the App Store. It resulted in the isEligibleForIntroOffer(for:) function returning false if the user was not signed in on the device in the StoreKit. Although the aforementioned issues were resolved with the iOS 18.5 Developer Beta 1, the latest Developer Beta 3 and Public Beta 2 updates fix it on devices still affected by them.

The B01, which is built on the same LEAP 3.5 architecture that underpins the B10 SUV , measures in at 4,770 mm long, 1,880 mm wide and 1,490 mm tall, with a wheelbase of 2,735 mm, which makes it longer and as wide as its SUV sibling. Compared to the segment-up C01, its other sedan on sale in China, the B01 is 280 mm shorter, 22 mm narrower and 25 mm lower, and its wheelbase is also 195 mm shorter. Exterior design highlights include a front end styling that follows that seen on the B10 and C10 , with a closed-off fascia and a slim light bar strip bridging the headlights. Likewise, the rear is similarly styled, with a horizontal light bar strip joining the rear light assemblies. Optional kit will include a panoramic glass roof. Two single motor powertrain options will be available to buyers of the battery electric vehicle (BEV) in the domestic market, and these are similar in form and output to that found in the B10. The first is a 177 hp (179 PS, or 132 kW) and 175 Nm unit, while the second is a 215 hp (218 PS, or 160 kW) and 240 Nm example, both reportedly sourced from different manufacturers. The 177 hp motor is juiced by a 56.2 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery, which provides the car with 510 km of travel on a single charge on CLTC standard measurements. This translates to about 420 km of WLTP-rated range. The more powerful 215 hp electric motor gets a higher capacity 67.1 kWh LFP unit, which on the sedan is claimed to offer up to 650 km of CLTC-rated range (550 km WLTP). With an 800V electrical architecture, the B10 supports DC fast charging that can juice the battery from 30 to 80% state-of-charge in around 19 minutes for the 56.2 kWh unit, or 20 minutes for the 67.1 kWh pack. Via the AC route, it takes about 4.2 hours to charge the smaller battery from 30-80%, or 5.6 hours for the larger battery. Both LFP batteries come from CALB (China Aviation Lithium Battery). Similar to other Leapmotor offerings, the B01 features the automaker\u2019s CTC 2.0 (Cell-to-Chassis) technology, which with its custom-designed low-profile battery cells offers not just additional cabin space but enhances structural integration and improves fast-charging efficiency. Inside, the B01 features a cockpit similar to the B10. Novelties include an 8.8-inch digital instrument cluster and a 14.6-inch 2.5K high-definition touchscreen infotainment display, with either a Qualcomm Snapdragon SA8155 or 8295A chip, the latter with 30 TOPS of computing power, working a Leapmotor OS 4.0 Plus operating system. While Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity is standard, the B01 will come with an optional roof-mounted LiDAR system paired with an SA8650 chip in China. This enables highway and urban automatic navigation assistance features and intelligent driving capability. The automaker said that the B01, which along with the B10 is aimed at a younger demographic, will begin selling in China with a price range of around 100,000 to 150,000 yuan (RM60,000 to RM90,000). Back in March, the company said that it is confident of selling more than 40,000 units of the B-series on a monthly basis. Looking to sell your car? Sell it with Carro .

Jess Root Cardinals Wire The NFL draft is Thursday and we are getting some last projections, reports and tidbits about the players expected to be selected. In some cases, this information could lead to players being selected later than expected. Could that happen with a potential first-round target for the Arizona Cardinals ? Oregon defensive tackle Derrick Harmon is one of the top interior defenders in the draft. He is big, athletic, productive and plays with a high motor. However, there is apparently an injury concern, which could cause teams to go a different direction. NFL Network's Mike Garafolo, appearing on the PHNX Cardinals podcast , said the concern is Harmon's shoulder, which could push him into the back half of the first round. \"That's how this thing works,\" he explained. \"All of a sudden, if there are two guys and you've got a tiebreaker, one of them has clean medicals and the other does not, then we'll go with the clean medicals sometimes.\" If Harmon is on the board when the Cardinals are on the clock with the 16th overall pick and they pass on him, perhaps it will be because they were worried about the shoulder.

With a chassis measuring just 5.5mm thick, this model significantly undercuts the iPhone 17 Pro\u2019s 8.725mm profile, marking a bold step in Apple\u2019s design evolution. The iPhone 17 Air is expected to feature a 6.6-inch OLED display with 120Hz ProMotion technology, offering a balance between size and performance. To achieve its ultra-thin form, Apple has opted for a single 48MP rear camera housed in a horizontal bar, a departure from the multi-lens setups of its predecessors. This design choice, while streamlining the device\u2019s profile, may limit certain photographic capabilities.\u200b Under the hood, the device is rumored to be powered by Apple\u2019s A19 chip and will include the company\u2019s proprietary C1 5G modem, supporting sub-6GHz bands. Despite its slim design, Apple aims to maintain battery life comparable to current models, thanks to efficient components and optimized software. In the Philippines, the iPhone 17 Air is anticipated to be priced around $899, aligning with the current iPhone 16 Plus pricing. Local Apple retailers and authorized resellers are expected to offer the device upon its release, catering to consumers seeking a sleek and modern smartphone experience.\u200b Apple2025launch AppleA19chip AppleC1modem AppleiPhone17 iPhone17Air PhilippinesiPhone17 ProMotiondisplay thinniPhone Bryan Aliwalas Bryan Aliwalas, a dedicated gamer and Multimedia Gaming Producer who enjoys mobile, PC, and console gaming.

Johannesburg, South Africa (23 April 2025) \u2013 There\u2019s something deeply powerful about walking into a space buzzing with hope, resilience and South African spirit. That\u2019s exactly what we felt at the 13th Proudly South African Buy Local Summit & Expo, held at the Sandton Convention Centre on the 17th and 18th of March 2025. The Good Things Guy team was there\u2026 and not just to witness the event but to find out why being Proudly South African is so important. While there, we realised it\u2019s more than a label. It\u2019s a movement! We met brilliant minds, entrepreneurs, innovators, small business owners and powerhouse executives. All committed to one common goal: building a stronger South Africa through local procurement and production. Watch the vidcast below or listen to the podcast here. But let\u2019s be honest, this isn\u2019t just a feel-good expo with beautiful booths and branded tote bags. This is serious business. South African businesses are the heartbeat of our economy.

Indeed, the pace of negotiations was brisk, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, with 18 different countries offering proposals so far and Trump\u2019s trade negotiating team set to meet with 34 countries this week to discuss tariffs. Trump himself expressed optimism that a trade deal with China could \u201csubstantially\u201d cut tariffs, lifting markets. After setting a baseline import tax of 10% and much higher on dozens of countries earlier this month, Trump abruptly put the steeper levies on hold for 90 days for countries to try to negotiate less stringent rates. The talks blitz is occurring after hundreds of finance and trade delegates arrived for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank Group, almost all with the singular mission of inking a deal to ease the hefty tariffs burden Trump has imposed on U.S. goods imports since beginning his second stint in the White House in January. With tariffs on goods coming into the world\u2019s No. 1 economy now at their highest in a century, the IMF projects global growth in 2025 will slow to 2.8%\u2014its poorest showing since the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014from 3.3% in 2024. And it is not just a pain being visited upon others: U.S. gross domestic product growth will drop by a full percentage point to just 1.8% in 2025 from 2.8% last year, the IMF forecast, with \u201cnotable\u201d upward revisions to inflation as the cost of imports climbs. Another big victim of the fallout is China, with the IMF slashing its growth outlook to 4.0% for this year and next under the weight of crushing import taxes of 145% now levied against imports to the U.S. from the world\u2019s largest goods producer. China has retaliated with 125% tariffs of its own on goods from the U.S. , effectively resulting in a trade embargo between the largest two economies, a standstill that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said neither sees as sustainable. According to a person who heard Bessent\u2019s closed-door presentation on Tuesday to investors at a JP Morgan conference in Washington, Bessent believes there will be a de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions but described future negotiations with Beijing as a \u201cslog\u201d that has not started yet. TRUMP ON CHINA L ater on Tuesday, Trump expressed optimism that he would make progress with China that would substantially lower tariffs on their imports but also warned that \u201cif they don\u2019t make a deal, we\u2019ll set the deal.\u201d Trump said a deal would result in \u201csubstantially\u201d lower tariffs on Chinese goods. \u201c It won\u2019t be that high,\u201d Trump said when asked about the current rates. \u201cIt won\u2019t be anywhere near that.\u201d He added that \u201cit won\u2019t be zero.\u201d U.S. stocks jumped in extended trade following Trump\u2019s comments, with Amazon and Nvidia gaining 3% each and Apple rising 2%. .N While talks have been slow to start with China, Bessent and other members of Trump\u2019s trade team have been pressing on with other key trading partners, though details are scant and no firm deals have been reached so far. The U.S. and Japan, for one, are moving closer to an interim arrangement on trade, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, but many of the biggest issues are being put off. Such an interim framework will not tackle the thorniest issues facing the two countries in their trade relationship, and it was still possible that no final deal could be reached, the person said on condition of anonymity. That movement comes after the U.S. and India said during a visit there by Vice President JD Vance that they had agreed to the broad scope of negotiations. While the two sides touted it as significant progress, agreeing to the so-called \u201cTerms of Reference\u201d mostly provides a roadmap for more extensive talks ahead. Meanwhile, a number of U.S. companies reporting first-quarter results said tariffs are having an effect on business. Consumer giant Kimberly-Clark said tariffs would cost it about $300 million this year, with CEO Michael Hsu noting \u201cthe breadth and degree of tariffs and also the countries involved have changed significantly since maybe where we were at the end of the last quarter.\u201d GE Aerospace CEO Larry Culp told Reuters he recently met with Trump and urged him to restore a tariff-free regime for the aerospace industry that existed under a 1979 agreement. Culp said the company\u2019s position was \u201cunderstood\u201d by the administration, but added \u201cit\u2019s not the only item they\u2019re solving for.\u201d GE Aerospace hung onto its outlook for the year, despite the cost of tariffs. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to press this point respectfully in the hopes that we can re-establish in effect what we had prior to the recent tariff moves,\u201d he said in the interview. The affirmation of its outlook helped lift GE Aerospace shares by more than 5%. Indeed, investors rattled over the past two months by Trump\u2019s harsh tariffs and erratic approach to imposing them seemed to find some solace among the earnings being reported. The S&P 500, on the heels of another steep down day on Monday, rose about 2.5% on Tuesday. Copyright 2025 Reuters. Click for restrictions . Topics Trends Was this article valuable? Yes No Thank you!

OpenAI product manager Nick Turley revealed the startup's interest in the world's most popular internet browser while testifying in court in Washington DC. Turley spoke in front of a judge who will decide what remedies to impose on Google after making a landmark decision last year that the tech giant maintained an illegal monopoly in online search. US government attorneys have urged Judge Amit Mehta to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser, arguing artificial intelligence is poised to ramp up the tech giant's online search dominance. Google countered in the case that the US government has gone way beyond the scope of the suit by recommending it be forced to sell Chrome and holding open the option to force a sale of its Android mobile operating system. The legal case focused on Google's agreements with partners such as Apple and Samsung to distribute its search tools, noted Google president of global affairs Kent Walker. \"The DOJ chose to push a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America's global technology leadership,\" Walker wrote in a blog post. \"The DOJ's wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the Court's decision.\" A Bloomberg analyst has estimated the price of Chrome browser, which has more than three billion users, at $15 billion or more. Turley said during his testimony that OpenAI had approached Google about integrating its search technology into ChatGPT artificial intelligence power digital assistant but was rebuffed, according to media reports. Google is among the tech companies investing heavily to be among the leaders in AI, and is weaving the technology into search and other online offerings. The DOJ case against Google regarding its dominance in internet search was filed in 2020. Mehta ruled against Google in August 2024 and the tech giant has appealed.

Among the most ambitious is Salesforce, which aims to do for AI what it did for enterprise software. Last week, Salesforce highlighted growth for its Data Cloud and Agentforce platforms, reporting $900 million in annual recurring revenue for fiscal 2025 and 3,000 net-new Agentforce deals in the fourth quarter. The company is pitching these tools as the foundation tapping into what it sees as a potential $6 trillion \u201cdigital labor market\u201d \u2014 which comprises AI agents powering marketing, sales, and service workflows. Agentforce and Data Cloud are the platforms driving Salesforce\u2019s agentic AI strategy. Agentforce, which debuted last fall, enables companies to deploy autonomous AI agents . Meanwhile, Data Cloud, its customer data platform, first debuted in 2020 as Customer 360 Audiences before evolving through several rebrands before becoming Data Cloud in 2023. Companies like CaixaBank, Maserati, OpenTable, and Pfizer are already using Agentforce and Data Cloud to power agents with CRM and other data. Other examples include Equinox and Wyndham Hotels, which are leveraging the platforms for real-time, personalized marketing and customer experiences across global markets. The challenge for companies like Salesforce and others is to show how new agentic workflows actually differ from past forms of automation. The old model was driven by bots and deterministic rule-based systems merely pre-wired to take specific actions, said Rahul Auradkar, Salesforce\u2019s GM and EVP of Unified Data Services. \u201cThe new world of AI is rewriting those rules, and the re-writing of those rules is determined at the moment based on the information you have provided and you\u2019ve grounded it with,\u201d Auradkar told Digiday. A key factor for Salesforce\u2019s agentic strategy is its cloud and agent architecture. Auradkar said customers can build agents using their existing data infrastructure investments along with customers\u2019 preferred large language models and data sources. Salesforce is also adding bi-directional integrations with Databricks (in beta) and Snowflake (coming this summer) to support AI-driven personalization. Diverse, grounded data is essential for AI agents\u2019 overall effectiveness. It\u2019s also key to reducing inaccuracies \u2014 known as \u201challucinations\u201d when AI models generate confident but incorrect or fabricated responses. Salesforce\u2019s Data Cloud is now powered by more than 270 data connectors, including its Zero Copy tool, which enables near-real-time activation by linking to original data sources \u2014 such as data lakes, warehouses, CRM systems and other sources \u2014 without copying or moving them. Data Cloud has had massive growth, according to Salesforce. In fiscal 2025, Data Cloud processed 50 trillion records \u2014 double the previous year \u2014 with 65% from external data sources. \u201cIf an agent powered by AI is trying to give or make recommendations or take actions on a customer\u2019s behalf, it had better be accurate,\u201d Auradkar said. \u201c\u2026For example, if the system is coming and telling you about an action it would perform, as opposed to what would [previously] already be wired in. It\u2019s the most optimized action you would perform, but for that optimized action to be accurate, you need to have the right data.\u201d Making agents easy to use creates a unique tension, said Gartner analyst Andrew Frank. Ease of use makes adoption less daunting, but it also makes it harder to prove value when a lot of the complicated back-end engineering is behind the scenes. \u201cJust because capabilities seem incredibly powerful doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re necessarily going to create value or improve customer experience or any of the things users are actually trying to do,\u201d Frank said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get trapped into the gee whiz feeling of automating this stuff.\u201d There\u2019s also the risk-reward trade-off. \u201cThe proactive agents can now act on changes in data so you can initiate processes without any human being being involved,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThat sounds really cool, but when you think about if it really creates value versus when it could create circumstances I can\u2019t even anticipate because I don\u2019t know what the data is going to do.\u201d Salesforce has been successful with branding agents and Agentforce just like Microsoft has been able to own the brand of Copilots, said IDC analyst Roger Beharty. Although category growth being slower than market expected, he noted Salesforce stands out for its overall strategy for Data Cloud, especially given the importance of clean, governed, managed data sets that are centralized. There\u2019s also the question of what clients are actually willing to pay for AI, versus what they say they\u2019re willing to pay, what vendors hope to charge and what the market expects in terms of returns. Beharty also thinks personalization might still be oversold across the sector, while the sprawling array of agentic options can feel overwhelming. (Just like it did with the earlier generative AI hype cycle back in 2023 .) \u201cIt makes for really savvy keynote presentations when you can wave the magic wand and then the apple becomes a grape and the grape becomes a peach and becomes black,\u201d Beharty said. \u201cLike that\u2019s a great presentation, but now you flip that around and does that have an ROI? Will that impact sales?\u201d Salesforce isn\u2019t the only company looking to power agents using a range of datasets. Other examples include Hubspot, which earlier this month expanded its AI agent options to more than 200. Another is Twilio, which is building AI agents through its open ConversationRelay platform that combines real-time data, speech recognition, and LLMs. Using contextual data also requires an interoperable tech stack, said Andy O\u2019Dower, Twilio\u2019s vp of product for voice and video. He also noted Twilio\u2019s approach emphasizes interoperability over prepackaged tools, with flexible integrations instead of silos: \u201cYour AI agents are only as powerful as their data, and that data needs to be real-time and contextual.\u201d \u201cThis should be an aggregate of a person\u2019s behavioral data, historical records, and the insights gleaned from past conversations,\u201d O\u2019Dower said. \u201cThe latter is especially important: each interaction with a customer should be a learning opportunity that helps refine and iterate on the AI agent.\u201d Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit https://digiday.com/?p=576086 Trending in Generative AI 01 Agency Culture The real AI challenge for WPP isn\u2019t scale, it\u2019s control 02 Generative AI Why brands and agencies are putting AI chiefs in their C-Suites Sponsored AI and human emotion are the building blocks of effective creative advertising 03 Member Exclusive Media Briefing: From fringe to frontline \u2013 AI\u2019s fast-track rise in newsrooms Most Read 01 Life Beyond the Cookie Google Chrome will now continue to use third-party cookies 02 Data Regulation Inside WPP\u2019s $150 million InfoSum purchase 03 Google on Trial Judge rules against Google in ad tech antitrust case 04 Marketing When it comes to ads, Apple isn\u2019t playing coy anymore 05 The Creator Economy As \u2018recessionposting\u2019 enters overdrive, creators are taking steps to dodge potential blowback More in Marketing View More Member Exclusive Pitch deck: Amazon instructs advertisers to spend amid Trump\u2019s tariff turmoil April 23, 2025 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Amazon tells advertisers to go all in on its platform during economic uncertainty.

For some, it spells the death of Privacy Sandbox \u2014 a project that dates back to August 2019 \u2014 with critics pointing to the proximity of Google\u2019s vp, Privacy Sandbox, Anthony Chavez\u2019s announcement this week to its successive antitrust rebukes earlier in the month. Basically, such voices are asking the question, \u201cDoes Google Chrome\u2019s latest cookie u-turn represent a peace offering to regulators now that it faces multiple breakup scenarios?\u201d Despite this, Google stands by its publicly stated aim of a utilitarian approach to supporting the ad-supported media ecosystem, noting it will continue to explore the use of Privacy Sandbox APIs in the coming months. To quote Chavez\u2019s blog post yesterday: \u201cWe\u2019ve made the decision to maintain our current approach to offering users third-party cookie choice in Chrome, and will not be rolling out a new standalone prompt for third-party cookies. Users can continue to choose the best option for themselves in Chrome\u2019s Privacy and Security Settings.\u201d Meanwhile, the plethora of companies (including ad tech, agencies and publishing outfits) that spent that last six years investing time, money and effort investing in cookie alternatives are left asking themselves, \u2018Was it all just a waste of time?\u2019 Moved before they were pushed? According to Movement for an Open Web\u2019s James Rosewell, a vocal critic of Privacy Sandbox, Google\u2019s apparent retreat from the Privacy Sandbox marks a significant shift from earlier efforts to centralize digital ad control and eliminate interoperability. \u201cRegulators are moving to guarantee interoperability just like they do in other sectors such as telecoms and utilities,\u201d he told Digiday in a written statement, adding that, \u201cGoogle moved before they were pushed.\u201d For Mathieu Roche, CEO of ID5, the timing of Chavez\u2019s announcement could represent the online giant offering an olive branch to government authorities such as the U.S. Justice Department, which is pushing for the sale of both Google Chrome and its sell-side ad tech in separate legal cases. Related Insights The Programmatic Marketer After the \u20ac150 million fine, Apple\u2019s ATT faces its hardest questions yet Read More \u201cI don\u2019t believe in coincidences when it comes to Google \u2026 it feels like it\u2019s some sort of negotiation tactic with the DOJ to prevent Chrome from being spun out,\u201d Roche said, noting that Google is likely to highlight how it is best-placed to preserve web users\u2019 privacy. Meanwhile, multiple sources consulted by Digiday pointed to the timing of Chavez\u2019s latest announcement, and its proximity to the recent $162 million ruling against Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency solution in France as a more likely motivation for Google\u2019s latest u-turn. Balancing act However, in the experience of Andrew Casale, CEO of Index Exchange \u2014 a company that participated in some Privacy Sandbox experimentation \u2014 Google is a much more intentional player, even if it does face multiple regulatory challenges at this time. \u201cI think it\u2019s very reasonable speculation on the back of the guilty verdict last week and search remedy trial this week, but I would look at it a little bit differently,\u201d he told Digiday, citing the multiple timeline pushbacks over the past six years. Instead, Casale claimed Google\u2019s delayed timelines have pointed to Google\u2019s efforts to both continue business as usual, for both itself and third parties, while also attempting to satisfy the growing voices of the online privacy lobby. He added, \u201cAnd I think in some instances, these two regulatory issues can be at odds with one another, and I think as it pertains to the cookie, they were trying to strike a very delicate balance between both issues, which was becoming more and more problematic.\u201d Jay Pattisall, vp and senior agency analyst at Forrester, echoed this assessment, adding how the years-long timeline gave both advertisers and service providers ample time to explore different options and experiment. \u201cThe kind of slow but steady, methodical approach was at least an attempt to give not only Google as a publisher, but all of its clients and partners the opportunity to kind of very slowly approach this and when and, and, you know, now slowly back away from it, right?\u201d Pattisall said. The fallout of Google Chrome\u2019s cookie u-turn? While expected by many, years of strategic planning now need recalibration, with dozens, if not hundreds, of companies in the online media sector spending much of the 2020s shaping their strategic direction around the privacy policies of online gatekeepers, such as mobile OS and web browser providers like Google and Apple . Separate Digiday sources that have experimented extensively with the Privacy Sandbox APIs noted how (while expected) confirmation of the latest moves was a closely guarded secret among Google executives. Such sources also indicated how Privacy Sandbox development is likely to occupy much of the meetings involving Google\u2019s executive team at next week\u2019s industry tentpole conference Possible. One such source, who requested anonymity in order to maintain industry relations, made note of widespread frustration. \u201cThe fact that this company has so much market power that they have us all running around for five years just to not move forward \u2026 f*ck Google.\u201d MOW\u2019s Rosewell echoed such sentiments, noting the scale of the collective effort invested in exploring Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox proposals in recent years, adding that \u201cendless millions of hours and dollars have been wasted by companies in preparation for this.\u201d He added, \u201cThat is unforgivable and should add further urgency to the moves by the DOJ, EU and U.K. to clip Google and Apple\u2019s wings permanently with antitrust actions.\u201d Meanwhile, ID5\u2019s Roche \u2013 who founded said company to offer the industry an alternative ad targeting solution to third-party identifiers in 2017 prior to Privacy Sandbox \u2014 advised advertisers to continue efforts to explore alternatives to third-party cookies. \u201cIs it going to take some wind of our sail, probably,\u201d he said, claiming that Google\u2019s policy decision will only further the challenges caused by fragmentation. \u201cWe\u2019ve been existing in this context, right with cookies in Chrome for the past seven years, and we\u2019ve grown. We\u2019ve doubled in size last year, because we create value, even in a world where cookies exist.\u201d Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit https://digiday.com/?p=576297 Trending in Life Beyond the Cookie 01 Life Beyond the Cookie Google Chrome will now continue to use third-party cookies 02 Life Beyond the Cookie Google\u2019s latest Chrome update leaves third-party cookie phase-out as unclear as ever Sponsored How data collaboration is forging scalable new revenue streams for hybrid business models 03 Life Beyond the Cookie After years of uncertainty, Google says it won\u2019t be \u2018deprecating third-party cookies\u2019 in Chrome Most Read 01 Life Beyond the Cookie Google Chrome will now continue to use third-party cookies 02 Data Regulation Inside WPP\u2019s $150 million InfoSum purchase 03 Google on Trial Judge rules against Google in ad tech antitrust case 04 Marketing When it comes to ads, Apple isn\u2019t playing coy anymore 05 The Creator Economy As \u2018recessionposting\u2019 enters overdrive, creators are taking steps to dodge potential blowback More in Media Buying View More Generative AI From CRM giant to \u2018digital labor\u2019 provider: How Salesforce aims to stand above the hype with agentic AI April 23, 2025 Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Salesforce says Data Cloud and Agentforce are driving growth of AI agents across marketing, sales and customer services.

Porsche 911 Spirit 70 interior, featuring the iconic Pasha pattern (Image credit: Porsche) Porsche 911 Spirit 70 interior, featuring the iconic Pasha pattern (Image credit: Porsche) Pasha pattern is everywhere, from the centre panels of the seats to the door panels and even inside the glove box (\u2018Upholstered glove compartment interiors and upgraded luggage compartments are a bit crazy, just like back then,\u2019 says Design Style Porsche\u2019s Volker M\u00fcller, head of Colour & Trim). There\u2019s even Pasha trim on the dashboard, paired with Basalt Black Club Leather and decorative stitching. All in all, it gives the Spirit 70 a rather lairy but no doubt period-correct golf club image. The decals on the bonnet and doors are entirely optional, but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that the design team behind the edition used the word \u2018Psychedelic\u2019 as a working project title. The Sport Chrono stopwatch on the dash of the Porsche 911 Spirit 70 (Image credit: Porsche) Porsche has used the opportunity of the special edition to add historical design elements to the dashboard, with white pointers and scale markings on the digital dials treated like original analogue models. The Sport Chrono stopwatch on the dash also gets this treatment, and the level of detail extends to the creation of a new chronograph from Porsche Design, shown here. For this 911 Spirit 70 chronograph, all the visual cues are present and correct, from the Pasha pattern on the dial to the green and white markings.

We all know the smell and unforgettable taste of a warm apple crisp, and what better way to tap into that nostalgia than a homemade recipe. When dreaming up the new Salty Caramel Pretzel recipe, our R&D team spent hours testing the combination of salted caramel and chocolate covered pretzels in our extra creamy vanilla ice cream to make this decadent flavor that\u2019s perfect for summer.\" Trend Themes 1.

OzViper on 23/04/2025 - 14:04 +30 Higher prices in USA = less demand\u2026 so more supply for Australia (should) = lower prices Max999 on 23/04/2025 - 15:48 +10 Should tell Sony about it for their PS5 pricing. bleeder on 23/04/2025 - 18:04 Not sure that's true as I believe they have large amounts of stock, would take probably a year for us to start getting savings. I could be wrong though. skidexa on 23/04/2025 - 20:27 Yep kinda like when china stopped importing our wine and lobster. Higher supply was dumped here at low prices FutureTech on 23/04/2025 - 14:29 +8 This is imported from China so not impacted. Our free trade agreement with China means that any Chinese goods are duty free. Save 50 Cent on 23/04/2025 - 17:38 Yeah not directly impacted as in cost per unit sold here but if there is more supply (due to less demand in USA) then lower prices makes sense.

I literally read it (US article) then checked local prices, and saw it wasn't on sale. closed tab. but I read it about a week ago, on a tech blog type website. basically 10th gen went on sale first for $199, then there was a \"Update\" text added to the top of article with timestamp/date, that \"now the 11th Gen A16 128GB is on sale for the same price of $199\". all I remember is the update text was inside a border at the top of the article.

Mr Mrrtn on 23/04/2025 - 14:30 Question - would paying with gift cards impact the ability to claim TRS or tax deduction as a business expense? FutureTech on 23/04/2025 - 14:32 +2 You should be OK for TRS purposes. Tax deduction is technically based on the amount of expenditure incurred (ie how much you paid to buy the gift cards as opposed to the nominal value of the gift cards used to purchase the item), so the amount of deduction you can claim may be impacted.

This is the first PR that lays the foundation for that. First, I'd like to mention that we're really excited to be working with the Godot community on adding visionOS support. We've attempted to follow Godot's coding standards and a high-quality bar for our contributions. We hope that our contributions align with Godot's goals. Lastly, even though we have tried to split the changes into smaller self-contained PRs, we acknowledge that some of these PRs can be of considerable size. We're very happy to iterate on our PRs after receiving feedback and suggestions from the community. High Level Overview The immediate goals of our contributions are: To support current Godot games running natively on a planar window on visionOS. To support creating Immersive experiences by using a new Godot's visionOS VR Plugin. To achieve that, and in order to make reviewing easier, we have structured our contributions in three incremental PRs. Add the native visionOS platform. Uses iOS as the starting point. Reuses as much code as possible between the iOS and Vision Pro platforms. (This PR). Add ability to compile and link Swift files within Godot, and replace main.mm on the visionOS platform by the SwiftUI app lifecycle. This is a requirement to be able to launch Immersive scenes on visionOS. Introduce Vision Pro VR plugin for Immersive support. Even though we have a working version including points 2 and 3, those PRs are not up yet. Our current plan is to open them sequentially, after each of the previous PRs merge. Technical Discussion This PR implements a new native visionOS platform. It's very close to the iOS platform in terms of implementation. In order to reuse as much code as possible, it introduces a new drivers/apple_embedded folder, to host code shared between the iOS and visionOS (but not macOS ) platforms. We took inspiration from the new drivers/apple folder, which hosts code that applies to all Apple platforms. The platform-specific logic (including app instantiation, client code, display server, os support, and export plugin) was refactored, and now the bulk of the implementation is on drivers/apple_embedded . The platforms provide small subclasses that specialize the concrete aspects that are different between platforms. We did this refactor with care, trying not to alter the existing iOS functionality. The visionOS platform doesn't have OpenGL support, as it's not supported by visionOS. In order to make reviewing easier, we have tried to split this PR into individual self-contained commits when that made sense, and we have added detailed descriptions to most of them about what's contained in each commit. It's easier to review commit by commit, to see how the changes were incrementally implemented. Documentation Considerations Now, the export plugin for iOS and visionOS share the majority of the code and most of their options (with the exception of launch storyboard support, which is iOS only; and specific platform icon support). Because of this, we have renamed EditorExportPlatformIOS.xml to EditorExportPlatformAppleEmbedded.xml , and moved it to drivers/apple_embedded . We'd like to ask the community if this is appropriate from the docs tooling perspective, and we're requesting further guidance on how to modify this file or the docs tooling to provide specific documentation for each of the platforms. Testing We have been testing this PR mainly with the Platformer demo project . We have verified the project continues to work on iOS, and it now runs natively on visionOS. We have tested both the Mobile and Forward+ renderers with the Metal rendering driver on both platforms. Open Questions In all our tests, we exported an Xcode project using the corresponding export plugin and template, and we then ran this project directly to an iOS or visionOS device. We'd like to ask the community to provide guidance, or to help testing the following functionality: We have not tested the ability of the iOS/visionOS export templates to embed and link plugins at export time. We tried to preserve this functionality on the visionOS platform, and we assume it will work in the same way it works on iOS. If anybody can attach a project using this functionality, we can help test it. We have not been able to make direct Archive/IPA export, nor One-Click-Deploy to work, not even in master . There are some differences between our developer account and what external developers use, so it's a bit difficult to pinpoint the problem. We'd appreciate it if anybody that has One-Click-Deploy currently working is able to test on both platforms. Likewise, we have not tested deploying directly to an iOS device using ios_deploy (used with Xcode versions prior to 14.0). If somebody has a working setup using this, we'd appreciate it if you could test this functionality still works. Alternatively, if ios_deploy support is no longer desired due to its age, we're happy to remove those codepaths for code simplicity. Missing Functionality The DPI metrics on visionOS are hardcoded for now. They can change at runtime depending on how close the window is to the viewer. We'll address this in the PR adding SwiftUI, as the metrics come from SwiftUI APIs. We have not implemented building a visionOS Icon Asset Catalog into the exporter. If somebody from the community can step in and implement it, that would be awesome. Otherwise, we may submit this as a later PRs. For now, you can work around this by manually creating your visionOS icon after exporting the Xcode project. Here you can read how visionOS icons work. And here's an example icon showing the Asset Catalog structure: visionOS-icon.xcassets.zip The SVG logo for the visionOS platform is just text, it'd be good if somebody could come up with a nice graphic. We're happy to answer any questions or address any concerns. We're looking forward to collaborating with all of you. @BastiaanOlij @clayjohn @coppolaemilio @stuartcarnie Feel free to mention anybody who would be interested in this change.

I have not investigated making it run in the simulator. Perhaps @stuartcarnie can speak more about this. Generally speaking, simulators don't support all the Metal features that devices do, and it can be tricky (and complicate the codebase) to maintain support for it. This is out of scope for this PR. But if we devise a way to support and re-enable simulator support for the Metal driver on iOS and visionOS, I'm all for it. Sorry, something went wrong.

Copy link Heaney-555 commented Apr 23, 2025 When using Metal to render directly on visionOS, only static foveation is supported. This is what Demeo has adopted, and we're planning to support this in Godot as well (on the Mobile renderer). Here are additional technical details about how this is done on visionOS: https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10089 I don't know what exact technical architecture Demeo is using, but I know it is using eye-tracked foveation. Why? Because I've captured screen recordings and I can clearly see the resolution change based on where my eye is moving. https://streamable.com/tgyqxq Here, for example, I'm darting my eyes between the book and the stairs. You can clearly see when I'm looking at the book vs not. The change in resolution matches how I moved my eyes exactly. Perhaps Demo is using PolySpatial? (apologies if this is too off-topic, just wanted to set the record straight on Demeo's visionOS support) All reactions Sorry, something went wrong.

Mark Mobius explains Written by Nishtha Awasthi , ETMarkets.com | Apr 23, 2025, 08:48:46 AM IST 1 / 11 Global uncertainty builds Veteran emerging markets investor Mark Mobius has cautioned that market volatility is far from over, citing rising uncertainty around U.S. trade negotiations. In an interview with ET, Mobius said investors should brace themselves as the market is likely to get even shakier. The comments come amid increasing geopolitical tensions, monetary policy debates, and global trade imbalances. Mobius also said India has a unique opportunity to take over global supply chains, but added that this would require urgent liberalization of its investment and trade frameworks. Without easing business-related bureaucracy, he warned, India risks losing this moment to attract global manufacturers like Apple. TIL Creatives 2 / 11 Trade deal uncertainty could disrupt markets further According to Mobius, ongoing trade negotiations being spearheaded by the U.S. President Donald Trump have led to increased market unpredictability. Trump faces a 90-day deadline on some tariffs and has multiple deals to renegotiate. Mobius stated that such rushed trade discussions often lead to complications and setbacks. He reiterated, \u201cbrace yourself, the market is likely to get even shakier.\u201d AP 3 / 11 India may benefit from supply chain shifts\u2014If it acts fast Mobius believes India is well-positioned to replace China in global supply chains, especially as countries look for alternatives. However, he stressed that India must move quickly to liberalize investment rules and ease trade-related bureaucracy. According to him, difficulty in importing machinery and setting up businesses is a key barrier that must be addressed if India hopes to attract large-scale investments from global firms. ANI 4 / 11 India cannot stay isolated from global trade tensions Mobius dismissed the notion that India can remain decoupled from global events. \u201cEverybody is in the same soup,\u201d he said, adding that India will become even more entangled in global trade dynamics due to its growing role as a supplier. He emphasized that the effects of trade wars are interconnected and impact all economies. TIL Creatives 5 / 11 China\u2019s bond strategy and the Dollar impact Commenting on rising U.S. bond yields and a weakening dollar, Mobius explained that China\u2019s selling of U.S. treasuries is playing a role. As China, the second-largest holder of U.S. debt, sells these bonds, it receives dollars in return, which puts pressure on the U.S. currency and raises interest rates. He noted this tactic may be part of China\u2019s negotiation strategy during trade talks with the U.S. Reuters 6 / 11 US recession is likely but could be brief Mobius projected that the U.S. may face a recession, though he believes it would likely last only a quarter. He attributed the potential slowdown to the insufficient growth in money supply and added that Trump would likely act to ensure the downturn doesn\u2019t persist. ETMarkets.com 7 / 11 Trade deal failure is the biggest risk The worst-case scenario, according to Mobius, is the failure of U.S. trade negotiations, especially if Trump cannot secure equitable deals with countries like Europe, India, and China. He warned that prolonged trade imbalances\u2014where the U.S. runs deficits with most countries\u2014are unsustainable and damaging for all parties involved. etimes.in 8 / 11 Tensions between Trump and the Fed add to uncertainty Mobius commented on tensions between Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell, especially over inflation and interest rate strategy. Trump reportedly wants to keep inflation high without hurting growth, which Mobius said is not possible if interest rates rise. He also suggested that Powell could be replaced with someone more aligned with Trump\u2019s stance. ETMarkets.com 9 / 11 Optimistic on India\u2019s long-term fundamentals Despite global concerns, Mobius remains positive on India\u2019s fundamentals, citing its large, young population as a long-term advantage. He said the current slowdown is temporary and that a weaker rupee could actually benefit Indian exports. Valuation discomfort among global investors, he suggested, may ease as fundamentals reassert themselves. iStock 10 / 11 China faces structural and geopolitical challenges Mobius expressed caution about China\u2019s economic outlook, noting the country\u2019s dependence on U.S. trade and its attempts to bypass restrictions through third countries like Vietnam and India. He also pointed to rising tensions between China and Taiwan as an added layer of geopolitical risk, making China\u2019s position increasingly uncertain. Getty Images 11 / 11 What should investors do? In uncertain markets, Mobius recommends investing in companies with low debt, strong return on equity, and consistent earnings growth. He believes that once U.S. trade negotiations conclude, the global market environment will begin to stabilize. Mobius also advised holding gold as a long-term asset, especially in periods of economic and geopolitical uncertainty. He said that gold performs well in turbulent times, and current global conditions make it an appealing safe-haven investment for investors.

This article contains spoilers for Apple TV+'s Your Friends and Neighbors. Jon Hamm 's new \"Eat the Rich\" series on Apple TV+ boasts an impressive Rotten Tomatoes score of 84%, but it has a timeline issue that just cannot be ignored. In recent years, many \"Eat the Rich\" movies and shows have landed on the big and small screens. While some, like Triangle of Sadness , The Menu , and Saltburn , have performed incredibly well among viewers and critics, others have been far less memorable additions to the sub-genre. A new TV show, starring Jon Hamm , seems to rank among the better shows in the sub-genre. With a fairly good Rotten Tomatoes score of 84%, the show continues Jon Hamm's streak of delivering one compelling television performance after another. Unfortunately, despite achieving critical success and being renewed for season 2, the original Apple TV+ show is weighed down by a timeline issue that one cannot ignore. Owing to this timeline inconsistency, one of the main story beats in the series also does not make a lot of sense. Your Friends & Neighbors Stretches The Suspension Disbelief A Little Too Far The Show's Main Plot Device Makes Little Sense Close In its opening arc, Your Friends and Neighbors ' storyline is primarily driven by Jon Hamm's character's desperation to keep himself afloat. After losing his high-paying job, Hamm's Andrew Cooper struggles to break free from the image of success he cultivated throughout his adult life. Therefore, instead of coming clean about his financial situation, he starts stealing from his wealthy neighbors to keep his head above water. While this narrative device paves the way for many intriguing story developments, it seems immensely flawed because of the show's overarching timeline. ...It makes no sense that John Hamm's Andrew Cooper is able to break into his neighbors' homes with ease without instantly facing instant consequences. Your Friends and Neighbors is set in the present year. Owing to this, it makes no sense that John Hamm's Andrew Cooper is able to break into his neighbors' homes with ease without instantly facing instant consequences. Cooper claims that his wealthy neighbors are so accustomed to living in their suburban bubble of safety and security that they do not even bother making any provisions to ensure their homes' security. While this could make sense to some extent, the fact that none of the homes Cooper steals from have any kind of active security systems seems like a bit of a stretch . Related Your Friends & Neighbors Cast & Character Guide Apart from walking through the double life of its main character, Andrew Cooper, Your Friends & Neighbors also features many memorable performances. Posts In Your Friends and Neighbors ' episode 3 , Cooper even sets out to steal the championship ring of an NBA star. Although the ring is enclosed in a locked cabinet, he manages to get his hands on it by watching a YouTube video about lock-picking. This again comes off as a forced plot convenience because why would an expensive piece of memorabilia be protected by a lock that can be bypassed using tips from a YouTube video? Your Friends & Neighbors Story Should Have Been Set In The 2010s An Earlier Timeline Would Have Made The Show More Believable If Your Friends and Neighbors was set somewhere between the late aughts and the early 2010s, its plot would have been a lot more believable. Smartphones and advanced camera-based technologies did not exist in the late 2000s. Owing to this, it would have made sense for Jon Hamm's character in the series to steal from his neighbors without being captured by CCTV cameras or other advanced security devices. Cooper's stealing endeavors would have seemed more organic and plausible if the show had taken place a decade or two in the past. Unfortunately, Your Friends and Neighbors attempts to make its story more relatable for modern audiences but relies a little too much on plot conveniences. It is hard not to see how the Apple TV+ show's drama would also have been a relevant reflection of the times if it unfolded somewhere around the early 2010s. With the Great Recession as the backdrop, Andrew Cooper's struggles with finding a job and maintaining appearances would have seemed more realistic and relatable . Jon Hamm's Performance Makes Up For Your Friends & Neighbors' Timeline Issues Despite The Flaws, The Show Is Worth Watching Close Although the show's main story setup seems too convenient, Your Friends and Neighbors has an interesting approach towards exploring the familiar \"Eat the Rich\" narrative. Instead of portraying its main character as another iteration of Breaking Bad 's Walter White, the show highlights how Andrew Cooper is hypocritical with his criticisms of the affluent people around him when he himself is trying to be a part of their clubs and sustain their lifestyles despite his declining net worth. Explaining Don Draper's influence on his Your Friends and Neighbors character, Jon Hamm explained (via Newsweek ) that \" Don Draper was responsible for selling the American dream...Andrew Cooper's pretty much responsible for buying it. \" By brilliantly delivering Cooper's inner monologue, Jon Hamm perfectly captures how his character's belief in being above his neighbors is actually a coping mechanism because, deep down, he realizes he is just like them. In some scenes, Hamm also seemingly morphs into Don Draper when he describes the value of the items he is stealing as if pitching them in an ad campaign. While Your Friends and Neighbors still has some obvious flaws, Jon Hamm 's portrayal of Andrew Cooper and his conflicting ideologies makes it worthwhile.

Read Time: 2 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email Apple's security update fixes two vulnerabilities that allowed hackers to access iPhone audio streams. Apple has released a critical security update , iOS 18.4.1, urging all iPhone users to install it immediately due to two serious security vulnerabilities that are being actively exploited in cyberattacks. These vulnerabilities affect the iPhone's CoreAudio and Pointer Authentication systems, allowing malicious actors to execute arbitrary code and access sensitive data. The attack on the CoreAudio is detailed by Apple as being \"an extremely sophisticated attack against against specific targeted individuals on iOS' and could see 'code execution' occur if an audio stream is processed in a 'maliciously crafted media file'. Apple said, \"We are aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on ios. This update provides important bug fixes and security updates, and addresses a rare issue that prevents wireless CarPlay connection in certain vehicles.\" 2 critical vulnerabilities Apple's security update fixes two critical vulnerabilities that allowed hackers to access and exploit iPhone audio streams.

Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify Despite not scoring a goal Saturday at Energizer Park, St. Louis City SC came away with a point and put an end to a stretch of four consecutive losses as it drew a 0-0 tie against Vancouver. A Vancouver club that entered Saturday\u2019s match with the most points in Major League Soccer and with a plus-11 goal differential got 15 shots off but had only one go on goal. City SC got off eight shots and had two go on goal. The draw earned City SC (2-4-3) a point for the first time since beating Seattle on March 15. City SC momentarily held a lead in the 25th minute when Marcel Hartel found the back of the net with an assist from Conrad Wallem, whose cross found Hartel alone in penalty area for what would have been Hartel\u2019s second goal of the season. Hartel\u2019s goal, one in which he had enough space and time to settle the ball on the turf before taking his shot, went under review to check for a possible offside.

Pompeu\u2019s pass to Klauss was broken up by Vancouver\u2019s Tristan Blackmon, leading the ball to deflect and find Wallem, who had gotten behind the defense by the time the ball found him. Referee Pierre-Luc Lauziere announced the goal was disallowed as Wallem was determined to be in an offside position. Another scoring opportunity for City SC presented itself in the 44th minute when it received a free kick from less the 30 yards out after Emmanuel Sabbi\u2019s slide tackle on Wallem led the Vancouver right winger to be issued a yellow card. The free kick off the boot of Hartel found Klauss, who charged in as the ball sailed toward the near post. Klauss attempted to head the cross in but the attempt was blocked by goalkeeper Yohei Takaoka and eventually cleared from the penalty area. A foul in the 45th minute when Edier Ocampo tackled Pompeu gave City SC another free kick in with the same range of their free kick opportunity minutes prior, but this attempt, a low-lining kick from Hartel, went far left of the near post and was not anywhere close enough for any City SC scorer to make a play on it. After coming in as a second-half substitute in the 73rd minute for Cedric Teuchert, Simon Becher had a scoring opportunity come his way, but it was just out of reach for Becher, who once played for Vancouver. With City SC advancing the ball across midfield and momentum behind them as Alfredo Morales found a streaking Klauss across the middle of the field, Klauss issued a wide pass to left back Akil Watts. Watts delivered a cross that curled in towards a charging Becher, but was just out of reach by Becher, who lunged at the ball feet first. City SC got another shot attempt off in the 87th minute from Wallem, but Wallem\u2019s shot was directly at Takaoka and saved without much difficulty. In the match, City SC was without defender Henry Kessler, the club\u2019s leader in minutes played with 720 through eight starts prior to Saturday\u2019s match. Kessler was said to have suffered an injury during Friday\u2019s training and was ruled out early Saturday.

Anyone had an issues withdrawing or using this without getting the old 'you are not verified' BS? krunchymoses on 20/04/2025 - 12:54 So far I've given them my phone number and the text does not have the code, but forcing me to install the 'authy' 2fa app. Dodgy already. Originality on 20/04/2025 - 13:06 +2 Authy is one of, if not THE, most widely used 2fa apps. Far more secure of an option than using your mobile number for sms 2fa. You'll be fine. shadowangel on 20/04/2025 - 13:07 You can read about Authy here https://www.authy.com/ Most exchanges will require at least time based codes, Authy owned by Twilio does timebased codes and push codes to your mobile device. krunchymoses on 20/04/2025 - 13:12 +1 Yeah I should have clarified - they asked for my phone number and then replied with a generic authy.com link - which is pretty disingenuous. I mean, sure - get me to add 2fa with an app. Don't ask for my phone number and then slap back with an app link. Twilio is definitely legit. I don't have it yet (okta, google and MS - so far\u2026) but I'm sure it was an inevitable download. Still. Just be honest ffs! Also - while it's technically 'more secure' than text 2fa that's not why they do it. It's absolutely for cost reasons. As if anyone is going to ghost my SIM for $100! edit: they sent me a 2fa code after a second attempt Hypermajoris on 20/04/2025 - 12:50 +1 Thanks Bro devilbabies on 20/04/2025 - 15:21 easy money. thanks OP!! krunchymoses on 20/04/2025 - 16:15 Bought $100USD of crypto.

The completion of new app sign-ups and account verifications, and access to geo-blocked services depend heavily to receive SMS online . The solution comes through temporary phone numbers, which serve as a protective shield and a convenient service for your privacy. This discussion demonstrates how temporary phone numbers function as crucial security measures for SMS verification over the year 2025. Digital Privacy: The Silent Crisis of the 2020s Every day, we encounter the irritating problems of data privacy breaches, combined with spam and robocalls, along with unwanted marketing messages. The root cause? Your telephone number becomes visible to the entire internet whenever you distribute it across online platforms. Exposing your phone number usually leads to its sale to marketers alongside bot scraping operations, which produce damaging and continuous intrusions. Temporary numbers work as digital protectors that prevent services from accessing your contact information.

And I would be if the AP were the neutral, fact-driven wire service it used to be. Unfortunately, it has become just another outlet peddling leftist opinion disguised as straight news. And as its fight with the White House demonstrates, it also reeks of a sense of elite entitlement. The AP lost its spot among a tight press pool that covers the White House. PhotoGranary \u2013 stock.adobe.com The case involves the AP\u2019s claims that its freedom of speech was violated when it was booted from its long-standing spot in the press pool, an elite, small group of legacy news outlets that get near-daily access to the president. The AP was one of three wire services in the group, along with Reuters and Bloomberg. More From Michael Goodwin Michael Goodwin: Harvard is jeopardizing $9B in federal funding to lead the radical left\u2019s anti-Trump agenda \u2013 so much for the best and brightest Trump, Israel have Iran leaders shaking in their boots Michael Goodwin: Trump\u2019s given Iran a way out from impending war\u2014they can do it the easy way or the hard way Others getting special access include television and cable companies, photographers, radio reporters and rotating members from print outlets. Refused to adjust Because there was just one spot reserved for print reporters, most got only a monthly chance to question the president in small-space events, such as the Oval Office and Air Force One. The AP got the boot from the group after it refused to change its influential stylebook and continued to refer to the \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d after President Trump officially changed the name to the \u201c Gulf of America .\u201d I agreed with the federal judge who ruled the demotion unfairly punished the AP, but have come to admire even more the way the White House has used the case to carry out a much-needed move to democratize access to the president. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt , who at 27 is the youngest person to hold her job, took office wanting to open the door to new media outlets, including edgy podcasts, political influencers and specialized wire services. President Donald Trump listens to remarks during a swearing-in ceremony for Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Mehmet Oz in the Oval Office in Washington, D.C., U.S., April 18, 2025. REUTERS That the new access would involve adding some conservative voices and diluting the near-monopoly of leftist, legacy media was inevitable. A first step involved a clever response to the court order, which said the AP \u201ccannot be treated worse than its peer wire services.\u201d So instead of putting the AP back into its guaranteed spot, the White House removed all three wire services and included them in a group of 31 other organizations, while adding a second print spot for the small-space events. The new rotation means that instead of a guaranteed daily spot, each of the wires will get into the small events about once a month. Naturally, Reuters and Bloomberg are also howling about their diminished access, and the AP went back to court, claiming the White House move violated the judge\u2019s order. The judge, Trevor N. McFadden of the federal District Court in DC, disagreed. He said Friday that he needed more time to study the issue but that the White House seemed to be acting in \u201cgood faith,\u201d presumably because the new policy follows his order about the AP and its peers. Indeed, as the White House put it, \u201cNo other news organization in the United States receives the level of guaranteed access previously bestowed upon the AP. The AP may have grown accustomed to its favored status, but the Constitution does not require that such status endure in perpetuity.\u201d Beyond exposing the AP\u2019s sense of entitlement, the case opens the door to the administration\u2019s plan to break up the stranglehold legacy media have on privileged access to the White House as well as to other federal agencies, such as the departments of State and Defense. Gatekeeper mentality Their gatekeeper mentality has become an acute problem in Trump\u2019s two terms because so many of the legacy outlets are openly hostile to him and the Republican Party. There are next to zero \u201cstraight\u201d reports, with nearly every story every day distorted by personal animus toward the president and conservative ideas. The approach is the opposite of how those same organizations covered the Biden presidency. Their lockstep behavior in those years featured soft-ball, friendly coverage even as the public turned thumbs down on inflation and open borders, adding to the evidence that big media is out of step with most Americans.

By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy . Never miss a story. Check out more newsletters The resulting decline in public trust in the media is warranted, with nearly all of those organizations ignoring the Hunter Biden laptop scandal. And despite supposedly being guardians of free speech, none opposed the censorship schemes orchestrated by the White House to protect the first family from reports in The Post and elsewhere of corruption. Moreover, none of the legacy outlets showed any curiosity about Joe Biden\u2019s obvious mental and physical decline. Indeed, some like The New York Times, repeated the White House lie that claims of the president\u2019s decline involved altered videos and right-wing talking points. It was only after Biden\u2019s disastrous debate performance last June, and the panic that Trump would win the election, that the media noticed his condition and declared, in unison, that he had to drop out of the race. As soon as he did, they all jumped on the Kamala Harris bandwagon and unanimously declared her campaign full of \u201cjoy.\u201d So they can spare us now their claims that they are essential to good government and public knowledge. Too often, they have shielded corruption and misled the public. This control of like-minded outlets creates a near-monopoly of coverage, one that involves the White House Correspondents Association. It is a private group that has for decades set up the pool for small-space events and also assigns the 49 seats in the separate briefing room, all of which are held by legacy media. Upset media apple cart They, along with the Times and others, are furious that Leavitt has upset their apple cart by scrambling the pool and opening the briefing room to newcomers. Often as many as 20 people with new credentials can be seen standing along the sides of the room, with some getting a chance to ask a question. And now reports say she is considering going even further by changing the assigned seats. Oh, no, the Sky is Falling, screams the correspondents\u2019 association. Acting like a thuggish union losing its grip on power, it is warning Leavitt against making changes to the seating chart. In a statement, it said the White House \u201cshould abandon this wrong-headed effort and show the American people they\u2019re not afraid to explain their policies and field questions from an independent media free from government control.\u201d Therein lies the conceit \u2014 that only media hostile to Trump are \u201cindependent.\u201d This is the attitude the AP took with grossly inflated claims that its demotion \u201ccenters on the government blocking AP\u2019s access to cover events,\u201d as if the agency had been banned from the White House. Fact check: False! In truth, Trump is the most accessible president in modern times, and probably takes more questions in a month than Biden took in four years.

In the meantime, TV it is. By BRIAN BLUM APRIL 20, 2025 04:03 Man Watching TV (photo credit: INGIMAGE) I once had the strangest fantasy: When I retired, I would spend most of my time engaging in one of my favorite pastimes: watching TV. Well, now I\u2019ve had a taste of that odd vision, and it\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be. Since my cancer turned aggressive , I haven\u2019t had the energy to get out of the house that much. So, pretty much every night (and some daytimes, as well), I\u2019ve plopped myself in front of our living room TV and indulged. After half a year of being a couch potato, though, I\u2019d much rather be outdoors hiking or having fun beyond the telly. I hope that will come back. In the meantime, TV it is. Indeed, during Hol Hamoed (the intermediate days of) Passover, when the parks and highways are overcrowded, the living room beckoned with even more urgency. The Netflix logo is seen on a TV remote controller, in this illustration taken January 20, 2022. (credit: DADO RUVIC/REUTERS) What to watch on TV? My watching preferences vary, depending on whether I\u2019m alone, with one of my children, or with my wife, Jody. Jody and I go for thought-provoking or romantic dramas, documentaries, and sitcoms. Here are some of the more recent shows that have hooked us. Like everyone else with Internet access, we binged on Adolescence , which was both a technical marvel (each episode was famously shot with a single continuous camera) and a riveting drama about an incel-inspired [\u201cinvoluntary celibate\u201d] teen murderer. We followed that up with This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman\u2019s latest, Paradise , which I can\u2019t say much about since, like his previous show, there\u2019s a huge twist that happens at the end of the first episode that I\u2019d be loath to spoil. Speaking of paradise, The White Lotus \u2013 with its hotel real estate porn, this season set in lush Thailand \u2013 has maintained its quality as a delicious send-up of some of the most entitled characters to grace (and expire on) our TV screens. We guffawed our way through Schitt\u2019s Creek; Ted Lasso; Man on the Inside; Fleabag ; and Amy Schumer\u2019s delightful Life and Beth . But it was Shrinking that captivated our obsessive attention. (Who knew Harrison Ford was born to play comedy?) We\u2019re not averse to subtitles. That has led us to many great Hebrew originals, such as The Beauty Queen of Jerusalem; A Body That Works; The Baker and the Beauty; Seven Figures ; and, of course, Shtisel . (We\u2019re waiting for its Antwerp-set prequel Kugel to come out on a streaming service that doesn\u2019t require a VPN to watch it in Israel!) Japan has long been on our travel bucket list, so I highly recommend Netflix\u2019s Asura , about four sisters dealing with infidelity; it\u2019s directed by our favorite Japanese moviemaker, Hirokazu Kore-eda. As good as it is, Asura still pales in comparison to Min Jin Lee\u2019s epic drama series Pachinko , which tells the story of Korean immigrants and the racism they experienced \u2013 and continue to experience \u2013 in the Land of the Rising Sun. WHEN I\u2019M on my own or with one of the kids, my theme of choice skews more toward science fiction. For that, there\u2019s no better option than AppleTV+, which is the home for hits like Severance; Silo; For All Mankind; Invasion; Dark Matter; and Foundation. Netflix is no slouch in the sci-fi and fantasy department, either \u2013 see the streamer\u2019s brilliant TV take on 3 Body Problem. Black Mirror posted its latest season to Netflix last week; Stranger Things is due to return at some point this year. The final season of Hulu\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (which nowadays seems less fiction than painfully prophetic) has just gone live, too. I\u2019ve enjoyed both Marvel\u2019s moves to the small screen ( Wandavision and Loki in particular) and Star Wars \u2019 forays on TV ( The Mandalorian and Andor being my faves). A longtime Star Trek obsessive, I\u2019ve watched every episode of Strange New Worlds and Discovery , although the most Star Trek -y of all in recent years has been Seth McFarlane\u2019s space-spoof-turned-serious-sci-fi The Orville . I\u2019m not exclusively a sci-fi snob. I\u2019ve also perversely enjoyed the increasing number of shows about Internet scammers, although some of them have hit a bit too close to home. Apple Cider Vinegar told the uncomfortable tale of wellness influencer Belle Ramsey, who scammed friends and family out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by faking terminal brain cancer and then claiming she cured herself through healthy eating. That was topped by Scamanda about another cancer scammer, Amanda Riley, who convinced her church she had lymphoma \u2013 hey, that\u2019s my cancer! \u2013 but had gone into remission and then relapsed a half dozen times as she bilked parishioners out of their hard-earned cash. She somehow managed to stage photos with actual IVs in her arm. Other scam-umentarires I\u2019ve binged include Inventing Anna (the Anna Delvey story); The Tinder Swindler , which exposed to the world Israeli Simon Leviev\u2019s continent-hopping con of gullible Scandinavian women; and multiple takedowns of Purdue Pharma. SO, WHAT\u2019S next on my TV bucket list? The restaurant drama The Bear is supposed to be great, if intense. I watched every episode of The Americans, so anything starring Keri Russell, who leads the spy thriller The Diplomat , will surely percolate to the top. The reviews for Seth Rogen\u2019s Hollywood satire The Studio have been excellent. He already had us laughing with his previous outing, the ribald Platonic . There are still a bunch of classic comedies I\u2019ve never watched, such as Veep; Parks and Recreation ; and Community . And it\u2019s about time I find time for the Israeli mockumentary Checkout ( Kupat Reshit ), which streams on the US-based ChaiFlicks. There\u2019s one more show Jody and I debated over whether to watch: Dying for Sex , about a woman with terminal cancer who decides to spend her final months indulging in, well, it\u2019s in the title. Unlike in Scamanda or Apple Cider Vinegar , this based-on-a-true story\u2019s protagonist really is sick and eventually dies. Hmm\u2026 that might not be the most appropriate escape at this point in my own cancer journey. The writer\u2019s book Totaled: The Billion-Dollar Crash of the Startup that Took on Big Auto, Big Oil and the World has been published as an audiobook.

The sexy, soapy series lassoed plenty of drama in its first 10 episodes, from a devastating tornado to the tragic loss of a town staple \u2014 Cap Fuller, played by the iconic James Brolin . Unfortunately, it\u2019s Brolin\u2019s status as an icon that ultimately led to his character\u2019s demise in Episode 10. \u201cWe wanted someone who was kind of iconic like Jim to [play Cap], but we weren\u2019t sure if he\u2019d really sign up to do multiple seasons,\u201d showrunner April Blair tells TVLine. \u201cSo I always had in my head that his passing would be the thing that sort of [changed everything]. Once Jim came, he was like, \u2018I would stay!\u2019 But we were sort of already in the process of killing him off, which was sad.\u201d Related Stories Emily in Paris : Camille Razat Not Returning for Season 5 Ginny & Georgia : Judgment Day Arrives in Season 3 Teaser \u2014 Get Release Date And Cap\u2019s death wasn\u2019t the only major development in Ransom Canyon \u2018s first season finale. Despite exposing Paula Jo and basically saving the town, Staten could still be removed as his ranch\u2019s sole trustee due to his loose-cannon behavior; Quinn accepted a position with the New York Philharmonic; Margaret was arrested for her involvement in Randall\u2019s accidental death; Lucas received acceptance letters from Columbia and Princeton; Lauren repaired her relationship with her father, though repairing her shoulder will take more time; and after turning down Yancy\u2019s proposal (for now), Ellie was approached by a woman who introduced herself as \u2014 wait for it \u2014 Yancy\u2019s wife . Below, showrunner April Blair explains how these twists could impact the show\u2019s future in a not-yet-ordered second season: A \u2018NEW MISSION\u2019 FOR QUINN | As planned, Quinn will indeed head to the Big Apple for a stint with the New York Philharmonic \u2014 and she will return. \u201cShe comes back with a new mission\u201d in Season 2, Blair says. \u201cQuinn has spent a lot of her past trying to save other people, and she comes back changed by this experience. Season 2 for her is really about saving herself and doing what\u2019s right for her.\u201d DID SOMEBODY SAY \u2018TIME JUMP\u2019? | The question is: Will we get to spend time with Quinn in New York, or will we pick up upon her return to Texas? \u201cThe beauty of Ransom Canyon is Ransom Canyon,\u201d Blair says. \u201cIf we started in New York, I\u2019m not sure it would be the same show. So I think we\u2019re going to pick up when Quinn returns home after her stint in New York, and that will give us time to see what has changed. Quinn\u2019s return is our reentry into Ransom Canyon. We\u2019ll see and experience it with her.\u201d MRS. YANCY GREY REVEALED | I don\u2019t know too much about where the storyline with Yancy\u2019s estranged wife is headed \u2014 other than it being bad news for Ellie \u2014 but I can reveal this fun behind-the-scenes secret: the woman who played his wife in the finale was actually Erica Dasher, who previously starred on Blair\u2019s then-ABC Family series Jane by Design . \u201cI don\u2019t know that she\u2019ll actually play the wife [in Season 2],\u201d Blair says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we only showed her from behind. But she was visiting me in New Mexico, and I was like, \u2018Can I make you the back of a mystery head?'\u201d REID\u2019S \u2018LOYALTY\u2019 IS TESTED | If you enjoyed watching Lucas and Reid\u2019s unlikely bromance develop throughout Ransom Canyon\u2019s first season, you\u2019re going to love what Season 2 has in store. \u201cThey hit some roadblocks, but they definitely maintain a friendship,\u201d Blair says. \u201cReid evolves into someone who\u2019s conflicted about life. He knows the sacrifices his dad made to save their ranch, but he also doesn\u2019t agree with all of his dad\u2019s moves. His dad moves a little wild sometimes. He has a loyalty to his father and a loyalty to his friendship with Lucas, and how he navigates those in Season 2 is fun \u2014 and a little heart-wrenching.\u201d A \u2018FRESH MYSTERY\u2019 | With the truth about Margaret\u2019s accidental involvement in Randall\u2019s death finally exposed, Lauren\u2019s mom is now behind bars and \u201cthat mystery has been put to bed,\u201d Blair says. \u201cYou never move on from the loss of a child, but we wanted Staten to be able to start growing emotionally and letting go of that ghost.\u201d But with a new season comes new drama \u2014 and a new question mark for the people of Ransom Canyon. \u201cIn Season 1, the pipeline was threatening to come in. In Season 2, it\u2019s being laid and constructed. There\u2019s a whole new, fresh mystery and engine to Season 2.\u201d OK, let\u2019s talk: Did you enjoy your trip to Ransom Canyon ?

Reply Haven\u2019t watched yet, but Josh is one handsome man!! Loved him since Las Vegas. Really want to see a show he\u2019s in do well. Reply Such a good show. Reply Loved it! Can\u2019t wait for Season 2!! Great cast and storytelling (though not excited about the pipeline actually happening.) Reply It probably doesn\u2019t help a series to call it a new Yellowstone rival or whatever, that\u2019s a lot of pressure! Reply It\u2019s kind of weird that they adapt these romance novels (this one does have family saga elements but it\u2019s still romance) and stretch out the happy ending over seasons with the exception of Bridgerton that does a couple a season. Staten and Quinn get their happy ending in the first book but now whether their story ends well depends on the show\u2019s renewal. Reply Ransome is one of the best westerns, but it would be sad to see splits between Staten & Quinn and also Ellie and Yancy. The main reason Im watching this series. Reply I cannot wait for season 2!!! I rarely watch series because they are so disappointing, but Ransom Canyon Season 2 can\u2019t come fast enough!!! Reply Didn\u2019t want it to end. Loved the characters and delighted to read there is a strong possibility for season 2. A slow burner that stays with you longing for more \ud83d\udc4f Reply Best series, hope it comes back soon. Reply Absolutely loved it. Will be very disappointed if there\u2019s no season 2, especially with so many intriguing loose ends! Reply I loved it but have a question. Why was Margaret driving the pickup that killed Randall and not Kit??? Why did Kit get her involved? Reply I think she call him after Reply My questions is where did the truck come from? She is the sheriff\u2019s wife and he didn\u2019t know her truck was missing. If it was Kit\u2019s, why didn\u2019t Lucas recognize it when they pulled it out of the water? Reply Did enjoy the series however this is exactly why Netflix sucks you get sucked into a series then have no closure and the fools at Netflix don\u2019t know if they will add another season or just act like it never happened one reason I refuse to watch series but they got me on this one.

Just finished watching a very very enlightening and productive webinar podcast interview with Jeff Park and Michael Saylor , some thoughts;: So, seems that one of the big things is the philosophy of winning versus not losing. The Philosophy of Life & Winning 3 Download Some tricky things: First, I think for myself\u2026 I think the first rule of finance or investing or strategizing with all the stuff is simple: to not lose money . To anyone who thinks that bitcoin is risky, or there\u2019s a chance of it going to zero, no. That\u2019s like saying that the bridge that was engineered with steel is most likely to fall, or the 747 Boeing airplane made out of aluminum will fall from the sky. Never buy anything that is not bitcoin Conversely, I would say that anything that is a token, is insanely speculative in a bad way and very very risky and kind of dangerous. For example, once again, my general thought is bitcoin is the truth, the way and the life, everything else is a false profit. To use a Christian analogy, bitcoin is like Jesus and everyone else is like the people worshiping the golden calf? My only certainty in life Anyways, the reason I invested in bitcoin is that like I\u2019m 100% sure it\u2019ll keep going up forever, in a volatile manner. I think volatility is guaranteed, but also performance is guaranteed . \ufffc Certainly as time goes on it will continue to become less volatile. Once more and more companies and institutions start to take control of it, you\u2019ll see less radical swings overtime. So what does that mean for us as individuals, individual investors etc.? Practical thoughts OK\u2026 I think it is wise to err with caution, but also be practical. \ufffc For example, let us say that you\u2019ve ridden a horse and buggy for like your whole life, for like 20 or 30 years, and then one day somebody invents the automobile. Maybe the early generations of automobile cars were dangerous, but, possibly assuming that it is like a world in which everyone has a horse and buggy, and then somebody offers you a brand new Toyota Prius. Or better yet a self driving Tesla car. Wouldn\u2019t you take it? Or better yet, let us choose maybe the most stable Tesla car, at least the design which has been perfected the most, probably the Tesla model S because simply it is their flagship model, the first one that was invented, and also the first one that was created. Or the Tesla model three which is like their new bread and butter. Or, let us say that you\u2019ve been using a landline this whole time, to make calls internationally to South Korea and the like. And then, I give you a new iPhone Pro, and tell you that you could just FaceTime people for free, internationally, unlimited forever, with no costs? A good analogy So I guess I have the privilege of being born in 1988, which means I have the privilege of being born in which I remember when I was in middle school\u2026 And then we all started to get blackberry phones, to send a single SMS text message was five cents! And to make a phone call\u2026 cost money based on how long you were on the phone. So there are stories even in middle school, these guys and girls racking up bills for like $300 a month, which was insane for the time as a kid, because they were on the phone like three hours a day? Or some kids who had no idea and we just sent infinite text messages, and it would cost them like $500 a month? And then, the unveiling that in fact the whole time\u2026 Text messaging didn\u2019t cost the carriers anything? That the whole time, they were like a bunch of gangsters, collecting tolls off of something that was essentially free? Anyways, that\u2019s kind of almost like the way that wire transfers work today. Or imagine that every time that you had to use your Visa credit card, you had to pay a 3% fee, that\u2019s kind of like what Visa charges for most companies etc. Also, international phone calls, from the states to Asia. To purchase these cards were insanely expensive. Brave new world So I will make the bold claim and assertion that actually, currently\u2026 all this tariff economic war stuff with mainland China is actually more impactful than Covid? Why? Ultimately when it comes down to it\u2026 Economic health is by far the number one critical thing. Main Street vs Wall Street For example I think that was very very shocking is that in the middle of COVID-19, all the big tech companies started to make an insane killing. And I think actually\u2026 This was very problematic because you had all of these tech elites, simply sitting on their butts at home, making a crap load of money, Whereas Main Street, the average laborer, the yoga studio instructor, the barre studio instructor, personal trainer, the personal teacher, forced to not be able to work because of Covid. As a consequence, Wall Street and the magnificent seven 7 tech stocks prospered while \ufffcthe rest of the world suffered? \ufffc Why everybody now doesn\u2019t like Donald Trump, including the Republicans What\u2019s insane hilarious is that all these conservatives, Republicans who own stocks, even they themselves are scared buttless. Even hilariously enough, I think Donald Trump even started to make fun of these individuals calling them \u201c\ufffcPanickans?\u201d Haha. To me this is so insanely funny. Anyways, once again the issue here is that a lot of Republicans, conservatives, rich people in America, they\u2019re only insanely rich because they have like 99% their wealth in Tesla stock, Nvidia, Apple Microsoft stock etc. But now, with the whole magnificent seven text all crashing, because of the tariffs against China, this is kind of like a new paradigm shift. Once again, almost like going from 56K Internet, to 5G mobile Internet or fiber Internet? Why is it so difficult for people to change? My personal thought is that the issue here is that individuals have been conditioned to fear, and also to become risk-averse, and loss of averse, even when the chance of winning is certain. I am 100% certain that bitcoin will go up forever, up to the right, forever, but once again, with volatility just like a heartbeat! And I\u2019m not sure if other people made this analogy yet, but I think an interesting thought that I have is that with bitcoin, and also with health in your heart, a heartbeat actually requires volatility. For example, for your heart to beat up and then down etc., a heartbeat cannot be steady or else you are dead . Also insanely interesting is that I think, when a heartbeat then becomes too stable is actually the sign of an incoming heart attack? So once again, you actually require variety and variation in your heartbeat, for maximum physical health. I also think with relationships, let us stay with your spouse or whatever, a relationship without any variation or variety is bad. Like for example I would rather have relationship in which the highs are insanely high and the lows can be very low, rather than having a C+ steady relationship for the rest of my life. Once again that would be so insanely boring. And I also think the paradigm shift here is that everyone just put their money in the boring S&P 500, assuming that it will just go out forever. But if I told you that the S&P would go down forever from now on unless you are a bitcoin backed thing, would you think different? Or, if I could tell you that with 100% certainty, moving forward you will slowly bleed your life force energy at 3% forever, wouldn\u2019t you be concerned? Weightlifting Another example, what would bring you more joy, to be able to increase your one repetition maximum weight lift 5 pounds a week, forever, for the next 30 years, or, to maintain the same weightlifting amount forever? Or for example let us say that I could increase your one rep Max dead lift steadily 5 pounds a week, forever, which means you start off at like 135 pounds, then in a year you become 335 pounds, then in a year 475 pounds, then 555 pounds, then, 700 pounds, then 850 pounds, then 1000 pounds, 1200 pounds 1500 pounds etc.\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t you rather choose this then simply you be able to curl 20 pound dumbbells forever? Steady yet jagged? So once again my analogy with bitcoin is this: it will forever be jagged up into the right! But once again, it will be like a roller coaster ride, op downs middles curves flips etc., and this is what makes it so great! Life is a game of roller coaster tycoon,,, what kind of ride would you build and prefer? ERIC ERIC KIM BLOG > More posts Why So Sensitive?

After briefly being marked for deprecation, it now looks like the drivers may be maintained with new maintainers alleging to step-up to the role. Apple HFS/HFS+ Linux file-system drivers haven't been well maintained in over a decade and even Apple phased out the original Hierarchical File System on recent macOS releases. But as some older Apple systems still rely on HFS+ for their EFI System Partitition (ESP), it looks like there might still be some life left to the file-system use under Linux. Longtime Linux developer Christian Brauner of Microsoft was working on deprecating the HFS and HFS+ code within the Linux kernel when some community developers have stepped up to maintain them. In response to the patch deprecating the drivers, an IBM developer who previously contributed to the HFS+ driver more then a decade ago offered to help in trying to re-engage over the HFS/HFS+ driver code. Viacheslav Dubeyko would prefer seeing the HFS+ code at least continuing to stick around the kernel. Debian developer John Paul Adrian Glaubitz in turn also expressed his willingness to help co-maintain the HFS/HFS+ code in testing/reviewing patches. Glaubitz still oversees some Apple PowerMacs and has found value in the old file-system code: \"If you're willing to step up as a maintainer, I would be happy to assist you by testing and reviewing patches. I have PowerMacs available for testing and it's also possible to just install Debian's 32-bit and 64-bit PowerPC on an emulated PowerMac on QEMU using the \"mac99\" machine types to test booting from an HFS/HFS+ partition. I am Debian's primary maintainer of these PowerPC ports in Debian (not to be confused with the little-endian PowerPC port) and I can also easily build various test images if needed.\" In turn sent out today was this week's VFS fixes pull request ahead of the Linux 6.15-rc3 release on Sunday. That patch ends up adding the HFS/HFS+ deprecation warnings only to remove it in the same pull request. Brauner explained: \"Revert the hfs{plus} deprecation warning that's also included in this pull request. The commit introducing the deprecation warning resides rather early in this branch. So simply dropping it would've rebased all other commits which I decided to avoid. Hence the revert in the same branch.\" So at least for now it looks like the Apple HFS/HFS+ file-system support for Linux will be sticking along if this code indeed begins seeing maintenance. 18 Comments Tweet Linux Might Drop The Apple HFS / HFS+ File-System Kernel Driver Support Linux PCACHE Proposed For Persistent Memory Cache For Block Devices Large Atomic Write Preparations Land In Linux 6.15 Linux 6.15 Device Mapper Brings Inline Crypto Passthrough For DM-Stripe Linux 6.15 exFAT Can Delete Files Much Faster: 4+ Minutes To 1.6 Second Optimization EXT4 Better Hardened Against Maliciously-Fuzzed File-Systems Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.

How the more expensive item might save you in the end Share Fast furniture or handmade? How the more expensive item might save you in the end By Scout Wallen Topic: Social Media Sun 20 Apr Sunday 20 April Sun 20 Apr 2025 at 12:38am Laura McCusker is part of the 'slow design movement.' ( ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke ) In short: Like fast fashion, fast furniture is the trend of buying flat-packed cheap chipboard furniture that may break easily and end up in landfill. One Tasmanian designer who hand-makes furniture that \"will last forever\" says there are cost-effective ways to source quality pieces. While new, handmade furniture might be more expensive than mass-produced furniture, buying second-hand can help people on a budget. abc.net.au/news/slow-furniture-how-handmade-is-fighting-fast-furniture/105157370 Link copied Share Share article Tucked away in a converted apple coolstore in Tasmania, Laura McCusker is designing furniture that she hopes will still be around in hundreds of years. The Hobart-based furniture maker adheres to the 'slow design movement', which she says is based off the 'slow food' ethos. Laura McCusker encourages consumers to buy from local furniture makers. ( ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke ) \"Instead of buying stuff that's really quick to access, quick to make and cheaper, you actually invest in pieces that will last forever,\" Ms McCusker said. \" So, buying once, buying well, looking after it, maintaining it and buying from makers who are local. \" This movement is the antithesis to fast furniture, which like fast fashion, is mass-produced furniture made of lower-quality materials, and is cheaper than handmade pieces. Online marketplaces such as Temu offer cheaper, lower-quality items. ( ABC News: Maren Preuss ) There are a number of brands that provide these products, which are usually flat-packed, normally not made of solid timber construction and can be shipped from all around the world. Ms McCusker said although fast furniture may be appealing, these \"fashion-based\" or trendy items have less longevity. \"I'd just be careful of that sugar hit,\" she said. Ms McCusker designs solid timber pieces. ( ABC News: Scout Wallen ) \"You can get a longer hit of the dopamine if you buy something that's better quality, or if you find something and repurpose it, like a vintage piece. \" You'll love it so much more than if you buy something that turns up in 10 days from China. \" The McRobies Gully Waste Management Centre has seen an increase in dumped fast furniture in recent years. ( ABC News: Scout Wallen ) Fiona McAlpine works at a waste management centre in Hobart, which she said had seen a gradual increase of dumped fast furniture since the COVID pandemic. Fiona McAlpine is the program manager for waste and circular economy for the Hobart City Council. ( ABC News: Scout Wallen ) \"We end up with a lot more of it and ultimately a lot of this material does end up in landfill because it's much harder to recycle than our traditional old solid wood timber furniture,\" she said. Ms McAlpine said the type of materials, such as composite timber with lots of glues, are easily damaged and hard to repair. Fast furniture is normally not made of solid timber. ( ABC News: Scout Wallen ) \"Often that material gets damaged really easily and people then don't pass those pieces of furniture on to others to reuse and they end up coming straight to landfill.\" The influence of social media Lin Yang, a marketing researcher at the University of Tasmania, said preferences for fast furniture have been heavily influenced by trends seen online, especially for younger people. Dr Lin Yang has researched consumer patterns. ( ABC News: Scout Wallen ) \"When it comes to actually purchasing, they would look for social media-worthy pieces,\" Dr Yang said. \"They might be thinking, 'this piece is going to bring me more attention' or 'this is going to allow me to engage with my mates on Instagram or TikTok'. \"Fast furniture really allows them to \u2026 quickly refresh their rooms in a day or less than a day, so this actually gives that \u2026 social value they're looking for.\" Ms McAlpine says composite-material furniture is easily damaged. ( ABC News: Scout Wallen ) She said cost was a major factor. \" The older generation \u2026 they tend to be more affluent, and they are able to afford up-front big investments. \" Important to be a 'conscious consumer' Georgia Quinn uses social media to provide tips on flipping thrifted items. ( Supplied: Georgia Quinn ) For 31-year-old Georgia Quinn, avoiding fast furniture and buying secondhand is the perfect middle ground between sustainability and affordability. \"It can be really tempting to just buy something because I need it for an occasion, or it's cheap enough so if it doesn't work out in my home, it doesn't really matter,\" Ms Quinn said. \"But it's not just the price that you're paying, you're also asking something of the Earth, which we all know is already in crisis.\" Ms Quinn runs a social media account where she provides tips on flipping thrifted items, including furniture. Loading Instagram content She said it was a conversation that required nuance. \"I think there's a risk of being classist when we're talking about sustainability and being really adamant about only buying from sustainable brands,\" she said. \"I think it's more about being a conscious consumer and buying things that you're actually going to use and that will actually add value to your life, and not just buying because something is cheap.\" Tips for being sustainable on a budget Ms McCusker said although getting an item designed is more expensive, well-made timber furniture should last hundreds of years. Ms McCusker says you're more likely to want to repair and keep using a bespoke piece of furniture. ( ABC News: Scout Wallen ) \"When you're spending a little bit more and it takes a little bit of time for that piece to get to you, something goes wrong with it \u2014 if it gets a knock or a bruise or a dent \u2014 you're much more likely to mend it and repair it.\" Ms McCusker said she does work for large and small budgets and understands why some people need to buy the cheaper option. Ms McCusker designs furniture for a variety of budgets. ( ABC News: Ebony ten Broeke ) \"If you're on a student income and you're living in share accommodation \u2026 you gotta do what you gotta do. \"Maybe when you finish with it, pass it on to somebody else or look after it, and maybe if it gets a little bit tired, give it a coat of paint. \"There's a million ways that we can keep these things lasting longer.\" The McRobies Gully Waste Management Centre has seen a gradual increase of fast furniture materials. ( ABC News: Scout Wallen ) Ms McAlpine said people can go to tip shops or secondhand stores to find pieces. \"It's not that you can't get something handmade [on a smaller budget], but you might not get something that's brand new and handmade,\" she said. Ms Quinn said she asks herself a series of questions when contemplating buying something new. \"Will it really add value to my life? Will I keep it for a long time when I no longer need it? Can it be useful to someone else? Will it just go to landfill next? Will I only have it for six months and then I'll just chuck it?\" Top Stories From $30 parmis to empty main streets, 'things have gotten out of whack' Topic: Cost of Living Photo shows A chicken parmigiana sits atop chips and a side salad on a white plate, which is on a wooden bench Boy dies off NSW beach as death toll rises to seven Topic: Accidents and Emergency Incidents Photo shows A heart shape marked out by flowers in the sand.

Posted in: TV | Tagged: drag race , rupaul RuPaul's Drag Race Season 17 Episode 16: It's \"Grand Finale\" Time! It's time for \"The Grand Finale\"! Here's a rundown of what went down during the season finale of MTV's RuPaul's Drag Race Season 17. Published Sat, 19 Apr 2025 19:37:06 -0500 by Eden Arnold | Comments During MTV's RuPaul's Drag Race season 17 finale, for the first time, the performances are not a lip sync battle, but each of the four finalists had to record and lip sync to an original song. Of course, the top two still lip sync to a song as normal, and in this case, it could absolutely be none other than Lady Gaga 's Abracadabra . In order of the main stage performance: Image: MTV Screencap Jewels Sparkles has progressively annoyed me more and more throughout the season, and I could hardly watch her finale performance. Between the \"ding\" and whatever effects they put on her voice on that track, it was just nails on a chalkboard. Her looks all feel generic, and it's just giving me bargain bin Jan with all this wannabe Ariana Grande hair, and I just cannot. The other thing that consistently annoys me is her tights when she wears these little lingerie dance numbers \u2013 her waist down is three shades darker than the rest of her body, and it is so distracting. Girl, I know they make dance tights in your shade, WEAR THEM. Did she deserve to be an early out? No, but a solid mid-out should have been her lot this season and the fact she made it to top two proves the producers don't care about the actual artistry of drag and are just regurgitating the same busted storylines and had to put Jewels in some kind of a box because she is marketable and likely the next cash cow WOW is going to push on the masses along with the Vegas show. Lexi Love 's drag feels over-engineered specifically to win the drag race by pandering to RuPaul, and it's as fake as her giant talon claw nails. I've said it before, I like some of the things she's doing, but her performance tonight just feels so forced and the very opposite of genuine. Of course, I feel that way about her on-screen persona this season as well. Onya Nurve 's number was the first one I didn't find myself unbelievably bored with, and that's because her stage presence and voice are absolutely fantastic. It's like a smooth, creamy cup of hot chocolate that's just the right temperature to sip and savor. Now, don't get it twisted. She's not by any means a dancer, and that choreography was a little rough, but she more than makes up for it in stage presence and aura. I will always gag over Sam Star 's performances, but I do see how she's just barely outshone by Onya in this performance in particular. The comedy element and personality weren't quite as there as Onya, but she just does a very different, super polished style of drag, so it makes sense for her. She did the house of Trinity (House of the Tuck?) very proud not only on the main stage tonight, but throughout the whole competition. The apple clearly does not fall far from the tree, but I really don't mind when the tree is as sickening and fabulous as Trinity. My personal ranking would be Onya, Sam, Lexi, Jewels, with Onya and Sam being the clear front runners and top two, because let's be real, as much as I love Sam, from early on it was clear there was absolutely no way that anyone but Onya was winning this season. Liza Minnelli was presented with the \"Giving Us Lifetime Achievement Award,\" and she is as delightful and sassy as ever. But, fantasies aside, the actual top two, Onya and Jewels, lip-synced to Abracadabra, and Onya brought the energy and stage presence she always does, while it felt like Jewels was just reveal and tricks and gimmick after gimmick. Was it entertaining? Yes, but did the correct queen win? Also yes. And with that, RuPaul's Drag Race season 17 is over, and honestly, the best part of the season was last week's lip sync, where we got the most sensational performance from spiritual winner Suzie Toot . Congrats to Onya and all the queens, and none for the producers, who suck. Stay tuned for RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars 10 news, which sees 18 queens competing and premieres May 9 on Paramount+ .

A post on the r/Millennials subreddit has struck a nerve with thousands of users after one woman asked, \"Anyone else give your parent(s) money every month?\" In the post, the original poster, who said she's a public sector lawyer in her 30s, explained that she's been sending her mother around $4,000 a year for nearly a decade. She also gave her mom a car, chipped in on another one, and gives extra cash on birthdays and holidays. Don't Miss: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare ? \"I'm not a rich woman either,\" she wrote, adding that she paid her way through law school with student loans and paid off the debt herself. \"But what really irks me,\" she continued, \"is when I mention investments, she tells me, \u2018Older people never really invested \u2013 we didn't have the same opportunities.'\" That's where the conversation blew up. Boomers Had Opportunities, But Not Everyone Took Them Many Reddit users pushed back on the mom's claim that older generations didn't have access to investing. One 67-year-old commenter wrote: \"We had hella great investing opportunities in our generation. Microsoft? Amazon? Apple? Starbucks? Real Estate? Yeah.\" Another added, \"People get mad when I point out millennials have more savings than boomers at their age , but it is actually the truth backed up by many studies. Fact is, millennials know they cannot rely on boomers for support so they save. Boomers expect everyone else to support them so they don\u2019t.\" Several noted that while OP's father, who's older than her mom, invested regularly and planned ahead, her mother took out a second mortgage and racked up credit card debt instead. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. A Familiar Struggle for Many Turns out, plenty of Redditors could relate. Some said they send their parents money monthly, even when it's a financial strain. Others described living with parents or covering expenses like rent, car payments, groceries and phone bills. A few mentioned they expect to support their parents for the rest of their lives, not out of wealth, but out of love and guilt. \"[My mom] never held down a job, never saved anything , never invested anything, and she sells anything of value she happens to have the moment she blows through her cigarette money,\" one commenter wrote. \"Now she lives with me because her landlord sold the property, and of course, she and her boyfriend just waited until it happened. \" Others admitted they've cut off family members entirely. See Also: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm \u2014 invest pre-IPO from $0.60 per share now . Cultural Expectations and Tough Conversations Some commenters, especially those from immigrant or Latino families, pointed to cultural expectations. \"I'm Latina, and our parents\u2019 generation truly enjoys receiving money from their kids because \u2018we are their retirement,\u2019\" one user said. \"That messed-up way of thinking ends with me, I refuse to think of my only child as my 401(k).\" Another user in the Philippines shared that he pays for house help for his parents while his siblings cover the utility bills, even though there's no formal agreement, just an obligation. But others pushed for boundaries. \"If you're giving $400 a month and don't know where it's going, that's a problem,\" one person said. \"You're not helping. You're enabling.\" OP clarified in the thread that her mom did help with childcare early on, but that was years ago. Since then, she's been paying full-time daycare plus her mom's stipend. \"It irritates me that she brings up every excuse in the book as to why her finances are bad,\" she wrote. Still, there were some who said they're happy to help their parents \u2014 if only because they know no one else will.

Just finished watching a very very enlightening and productive webinar podcast interview with Jeff Park and Michael Saylor, some thoughts:: So, seems that one of the big things is the philosophy of winning versus not losing. Some tricky things: First, I think for myself\u2026 I think the first rule of finance or investing or strategizing with all the stuff is simple: to not lose money to anyone who thinks that bitcoin is risky, or there\u2019s a chance of it going to zero, no. That\u2019s like saying that The bridge that was engineered with steel is most likely to fall, or the 747 Boeing airplane made out of aluminum will fall from the sky. Conversely, I would say that anything that is a token, is insanely speculative in a bad way and very very risky and kind of dangerous. For example, once again, my general thought is bitcoin is the truth, the way and the life, everything else is a false profit. To use a Christian analogy, bitcoin is like Jesus and everyone else is like the people worshiping the golden calf? Anyways, the reason I invested in bitcoin is that like I\u2019m 100% sure it\u2019ll keep going up forever, in a volatile manner. I think volatility is guaranteed, but also performance is guaranteed . \ufffc Certainly as time goes on it will continue to become less volatile. Once more and more companies and institutions start to take control of it, you\u2019ll see less radical swings overtime. So what does that mean for us as individuals, individual investors etc.? . OK\u2026 I think it is wise to err with caution, but also be practical. \ufffc For example, let us say that you\u2019ve taken a horse and buggy for like your whole life, for like 20 or 30 years, and then one day somebody invent the automobile. Maybe the early generations of automobile cars were dangerous, but, possibly assuming that it is like a world in which everyone has a horse and buggy, and then somebody offers you a brand new Toyota Prius. Or better yet a self driving Tesla car. Wouldn\u2019t you take it? Or better yet, let us choose maybe the most stable Tesla car, at least the design which has been perfected the most, probably the Tesla model S because simply it is their flagship model, the first one that was invented, and also the first one that was created. Or the Tesla model three which is like Their new bread and butter. Or, let us say that you\u2019ve been using a landline this whole time, to make calls internationally to South Korea and the like. And then, I give you a new iPhone Pro, and tell you that you could just FaceTime people for free, internationally, unlimited forever, with no costs? A good analogy So I guess I have the privilege of being born in 1988, which means I have the privilege of being born in which I remember when I was in middle school\u2026 And then we all started to get blackberry phones, to send a single SMS text message was five cents! And to make a phone call\u2026 Cost money based on how long you were on the phone. So there are stories even in middle school, these guys and girls racking up bills for like $300 a month, which was insane for the time as a kid, because they were on the phone like three hours a day? Or some kids who had no idea and we just sent infinite text messages, and it would cost them like $500 a month? And then, the unveiling that in fact the whole time\u2026 Text messaging didn\u2019t cost the carriers anything? That the whole time, they were like a bunch of gangsters, collecting tolls off of something that was essentially free? Anyways, that\u2019s kind of almost like the way that wire transfers work today. Or imagine that every time that you had to use your Visa credit card, you had to pay a 3% fee, that\u2019s kind of like what Visa charges for most companies etc. Also, International phone calls, from the states to Asia. To purchase these cards were insanely expensive. Brave new world So I will make the bold claim in assertion that actually, currently\u2026 All this tariff economic war stuff with mainland China is actually more dramatic than Covid? Why? Ultimately when it comes down to it\u2026 Economic health is by far the number one critical thing. For example I think that was very very shocking is that in the middle of COVID-19, all the big tech companies started to make an insane killing. And I think actually\u2026 This was very problematic because you had all of these tech elites, simply sitting on their butts at home, making a crap load of money, Whereas Main Street, the average laborer, the yoga studio instructor, the barre studio instructor, personal trainer, the personal teacher, forced to not be able to work because of Covid. As a consequence, Wall Street and the magnificent seven 7 tech stocks prospered while \ufffcthe rest of the world suffered? \ufffc Why everybody now doesn\u2019t like Donald Trump, including the Republicans What\u2019s insane hilarious is that all these conservatives, Republicans who own stocks, even they themselves are scared buttless. Even hilariously enough, I think Donald Trump even started to make fun of these individuals calling them \u201c\ufffcPanickans?\u201d Haha. To me this is so insanely funny. Anyways, once again the issue here is that a lot of Republicans, conservatives, rich people in America, they\u2019re only insanely rich because they have like 99% their wealth in Tesla stock, Nvidia, Apple Microsoft stock etc. But now, with the whole magnificent seven text all crashing, because of the tariffs against China, this is kind of like a new paradigm shift. Once again, almost like going from 56K Internet, to 5G mobile Internet or fiber Internet? Why is it so difficult for people to change? My personal thought is that the issue here is that individuals have been conditioned to fear, and also to become risk-averse, and loss of averse, even when the chance of winning is certain. I am 100% certain that bitcoin will go up forever, up to the right, forever, but once again, with volatility just like a heartbeat! And I\u2019m not sure if other people made this analogy yet, but I think an interesting thought that I have is that with bitcoin, and also with health in your heart, a heartbeat actually requires volatility. For example, for your heart to beat up and then down etc., a heartbeat cannot be steady or else you are dead . Also insanely interesting is that I think, when a heartbeat then becomes too stable is actually the sign of an incoming heart attack? So once again, you actually require variety and variation in your heartbeat, for maximum physical health. I also think with relationships, let us stay with your spouse or whatever, a relationship without any variation or variety is bad. Like for example I would rather have relationship in which the highs are insanely high and the lows can be very low, rather than having a C+ steady relationship for the rest of my life. Once again that would be so insanely boring. And I also think the paradigm shift here is that everyone just put their money in the boring S&P 500, assuming that it will just go out forever. But if I told you that the S&P would go down forever from now on unless you are a bitcoin backed thing, would you think different? Or, if I could tell you that with 100% certainty, moving forward you will slowly bleed your life force energy at 3% forever, wouldn\u2019t you be concerned? Weightlifting Another example, what would bring you more joy, to be able to increase your one repetition maximum weight lift 5 pounds a week, forever, for the next 30 years, or, to maintain the same weightlifting amount forever? Or for example let us say that I could increase your one rep Max dead lift steadily 5 pounds a week, forever, which means you start off at like 135 pounds, then in a year you become 335 pounds, then in a year 475 pounds, then 555 pounds, then, 700 pounds, then 850 pounds, then 1000 pounds, 1200 pounds 1500 pounds etc.\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t you rather choose this then simply you be able to curl 20 pound dumbbells forever? Steady yet jagged? So once again my analogy with bitcoin is this: it will forever be jagged up into the right! But once again, it will be like a roller coaster ride, op downs middles curves flips etc., and this is what makes it so great! . More posts Why So Sensitive?

However, I'm a bit confused about the steps, especially since it's my first time trying Linux on a Mac. My device specs: MacBook Pro 2017 Intel chip 256GB SSD Current OS: macOS Monterey What I'd like to know: How do I create a bootable Ubuntu USB from macOS? Is it possible to dual boot with macOS? If yes, how should I manage the partitions? Do I need to use a boot manager like rEFInd? Are there common issues on Macs after installing Ubuntu (e.g. Wi-Fi, trackpad, audio)? If I had an Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2), would the process be different?

Check out our Code of Conduct . 5 1 Please be precise with details; you mention \" latest version of Ubuntu \" but then use \" Ubuntu 24.04 \" as example, but that release was the third last release (ie. two later releases exist!). Your first line contains contradictions, so please clarify. Are you only considering LTS releases for example ( Ubuntu 24.04 is the latest LTS, just far from latest release ). You also don't mention product (Server? Desktop?) as they have different installers, different docs etc. \u2013 guiverc Commented 23 hours ago This question is similar to: How do I install Ubuntu? .

See below Is it possible to dual boot with macOS? If yes, how should I manage the partitions? Yes, possible, install macOS first, then create empty partition with macOS and install Ubuntu there Do I need to use a boot manager like rEFInd? No, I have several dual booting macs, and the default boot manager works great with Ubuntu (restart, hold option key) Are there common issues on Macs after installing Ubuntu (e.g. Wi-Fi, track pad, audio)? Only issue may be WiFi or sound. I believe the WiFi works on your model. There are also easy fixes to the audio if needed via google. Check out https://t2linux.org/ for more details. If I had an Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2), would the process be different? VM: Run the ARM version of Ubuntu from https://ubuntu.com/download/server/arm Dual boot: Check out the Ubuntu Asahi and Asahi Linux projects. They provide a single command, which you run within Mac OS to automatically set up dual boot. Here are the steps to install and run Ubuntu on your Mac: Download the latest iso from ubuntu https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop choose the Intel or AMD 64-bit architecture You'll need a usb stick/drive with at least 7GB of space. Create a bootable USB drive with the following steps: Launch Disk Utility Select the USB stick device select Erase from the tool bar (or right-click menu) Set the format to MS-DOS (FAT) and the scheme to GUID Partition Map. Check you\u2019ve chosen the correct device and click Erase. Install and run Etcher After downloading, Etcher can either be run in-place or dragged into your Applications folder. Etcher configuration: Select image then select drive, replaced by the name of your USB device Click Flash, and will write to the drive Restart or power-on the Mac with the USB stick inserted while the Option/alt key is pressed. This will launch Apple\u2019s \u2018Startup Manager\u2019. Your USB stick should appear. Selecting this will lead you to the standard Ubuntu boot menu. I would do the full boot (Ubuntu only, no macOS) first and make sure you are comfortable with the process. Then try the dual boot. Many articles how to dual boot are out there.

The sooner Samsung Galaxy owners can put the Android 15 debacle behind them, the better. The optics around this critical upgrade, with its game-changing security and privacy updates, were already awkward heading into 2025. But no-one expected we\u2019d still be talking about the One UI 7 release come the summer. And yet here we are \u2014 some Galaxy phones won\u2019t be upgraded until July.

Now, it\u2019s the worst,\u201d even though \u201cSamsung has done something incredible with One UI 7 \u2014 easily Samsung\u2019s biggest Android update in years,\u201d the company \u201chas botched the release of One UI 7 to a degree I didn\u2019t think was possible.\u201d Forbes Google Confirms Gmail Update\u2014Stop Using Your Password Now By Zak Doffman Samsung\u2019s One UI 7 wrap around Android 15 is excellent . And the enhancements to Maximum Restrictions are particularly welcome. But One UI 8 goes further, and your Galaxy phones will be much safer and more secure with the upgrade. So, perhaps it\u2019s a positive that the Galaxy-maker will likely rush out Android 16 \u2014 as best it can \u2014 to recover the One UI 7 situation \u2014 as best it can. With Apple toppling Android\u2019s leading OEM in the best-selling phone list for the first time, the stakes are high. In some ways, Android 16 enables other OEMs\u201a including Google\u2019s Pixel \u2014 to catch up with Samsung. The new Advanced Protection Mode is a form of Maximum Restrictions that will be universally available. And just as with Samsung, this brings unsafe network blocks (including 2G), sideloading blocks, safer browsing and theft protection. It also wraps up Google\u2019s various new spam protections.

The websites also list eligible A series, Tab series, F series and M series phones. As for timing, SamMobile says \u201cOne UI 8 could start rolling out by late July or early August. That\u2019s just speculation based on what our sources have told us, but since the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 are launching with One UI 8 preloaded, we can expect it to start making its way to eligible devices much earlier than any previous version of One UI, not just One UI 7.\u201d Let\u2019s hope that\u2019s right, and One UI 7 is soon forgotten.

For years, US companies created and designed many of the world's bestselling products, while relying on China to produce most of them and buy many of them. Reuters The semiconductor industry has lobbied two presidential administrations to go easy with restrictions on selling cutting-edge computer chips to China. Jensen Huang , CEO of Nvidia , the world's leading artificial intelligence chipmaker, even traveled to the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida this month to discuss policy with President Donald Trump. But with the Trump administration putting new curbs on AI chip sales this week, it is clear that the industry's pushback has failed. The fallout has set off a scramble among chipmakers to reset expectations for a future with less sales to China and prompted fears that their retreat could turn Chinese tech giant Huawei into a global chipmaking powerhouse. The Trump administration said Tuesday that it was taking measures to restrict the sale of AI chips by Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. The crackdown essentially closed the door on a fast-growing business in China, which buys more chips than any other country. In the two days after the limits became public, shares of Nvidia, the world's leading AI chipmaker, fell 8.4%. AMD's shares dropped 7.4%, and Intel's were down 6.8%. \"For the U.S. semiconductor industry, China is gone,\" said Handel Jones, a semiconductor consultant at International Business Strategies, which advises electronics companies. He projects that Chinese companies will have a majority share of chips in every major category in China by 2030.

Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories But over the past decade, the balance shifted as China began to develop homegrown rivals and Trump began imposing tariffs. AI has heightened those tensions. The technology has the potential to create trillions of dollars in economic value and funnel tremendous power to the two countries vying for AI supremacy: the United States and China. Computer chips are the building blocks of AI. Nvidia, in particular, dominates the market for chips used to build AI systems. It was on the verge of becoming the first publicly traded company worth $4 trillion before a stock swoon over the past few months dropped its value below $2.5 trillion. In 2022, the Biden administration started imposing rules to restrict China's ability to buy Nvidia AI chips. The administration added more limits each subsequent year. Then, this week the Trump administration blocked the last AI chip that Nvidia was selling to China, the H20, saying it was in the government's national and economic security interest. The timing couldn't have been worse for Nvidia. Huang had a scheduled trip to China this week. He spent Thursday with Chinese leaders, stressing how important the country was to his business. \"We're going to continue to make significant effort to optimize our products that are compliant within the regulations and continue to serve China's market,\" Huang said during a meeting with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. Huang's message spoke to one of his biggest fears. For years, he has worried that Huawei, China's telecommunications giant, will become a major competitor in AI. He has warned U.S. officials that blocking U.S. companies from competing in China would accelerate Huawei's rise, said three people familiar with those meetings who spoke on the condition of anonymity. If Huawei gains ground, Huang and others at Nvidia have painted a dark picture of a future in which China will use the company's chips to build AI data centers across the world for the Belt and Road Initiative, a strategic effort to increase Beijing's influence by paying for infrastructure projects around the world, a person familiar with the company's thinking said. Huawei has entered and conquered other markets. Over the years, it has surpassed Ericsson and Nokia in telecommunications and taken on Apple in smartphones. But the company's semiconductor business faces challenges. Washington has blocked China from making chips in Taiwan, which produces the world's most powerful semiconductors. It also prevents Chinese companies from buying machines made by ASML, a Dutch company whose machines are essential for manufacturing the most advanced semiconductors. Nvidia's previous generation of chips perform about 40% better than Huawei's best product, said Gregory C. Allen, who has written about Huawei in his role as director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But that gap could dwindle if Huawei scoops up the business of its American rivals, Allen said. Nvidia was expected to make more than $16 billion in sales this year from the H20 in China before the restriction. Huawei could use that money to hire more experienced engineers and make higher-quality chips. Allen said the U.S. government's restrictions also could help Huawei bring on customers like DeepSeek, a leading Chinese AI startup. Working with those companies could help Huawei improve the software it develops to control its chips. Those kinds of tools have been one of Nvidia's strengths over the years. Huawei didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. To prevent Huawei from gaining ground, said Dylan Patel, chief analyst for research firm SemiAnalysis, who closely follows the rise of AI technologies, U.S. officials must prevent China from buying American chipmaking equipment. The U.S. government allows some Chinese companies to buy American machinery. Chinese companies have exploited that loophole, Patel said. His firm has reported that approved companies have bought equipment and transferred it to Chinese companies that have been blocked from buying it. \"Huawei is a ferocious competitor,\" Allen said. \"It brings a mixture of very high-quality talent, psychotically driven work culture and the deep backing of the Chinese government.\" Read More News on Nvidia US chipmakers Huawei AI chip sales semiconductor industry China AI market China tech competition Trump administration Jensen Huang Read More News on Nvidia US chipmakers Huawei AI chip sales semiconductor industry China AI market China tech competition Trump administration Jensen Huang Prime Exclusives Investment Ideas Stock Report Plus ePaper Wealth Edition We\u2019re building Peak XV into a global firm: Shailendra Singh Take a dip, Maha Kumbh may have flown the best Q4 for Indian airlines Should construction, mining be halted between noon and 3 PM?

(AP Photo/Frank Franklin II) (ASSOCIATED PRESS) NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Francisco Lindor knew. He didn't have to watch. He turned on an inside cutter from Ryan Fernandez leading off the ninth inning and sent the ball soaring into Citi Field's second deck in right field, 401 feet away. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \u201cI hit it with everything I had,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that one didn\u2019t go, I was going to run out of luck.\u201d Lindor's home run, the 250th of his major league career, lifted the New York Mets over the St. Louis Cardinals 5-4 on Friday night and sent smoke rising from the Home Run Apple in center field. He started to watch the ball head toward the seats, then turned away and decided there was no reason to observe the remainder of its parabolic journey. \u201cI kept my face in the dugout with the guys,\u201d Lindor said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where the ball landed. I knew it was going to be a home run.\u201d New York overcame deficits of 2-0 in the fifth and 3-2 in the sixth, then took a 4-3 lead on Luis Torrens' RBI double in the eighth. The Mets blew that advantage when Huascar Brazob\u00e1n allowed Brendan Donovan home run starting the top of the ninth, a drive off the netting of the foul pole in right. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Brazob\u00e1n struck out Jordan Walker, Thomas Saggese and Pedro Pag\u00e9s in order to bring up the 31-year-old Lindor, a centerpiece of the Mets' revival that saw them reach last year's NL Championship Series. Lindor took a cutter that bounced and a fastball for a strike, then feasted on the 1-1 pitch for his first walk-off homer with the Mets, the third of his major league career and first since 2018 with Cleveland. \u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s an elite player and a special player, because the moment is never too big for him,\u201d Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \u201cHe knows what\u2019s at stake and he lives for those moments and he came through again today. Special player, special person.\u201d Lindor became the 254th player with 250 homers and just the fifth to hit that amount primarily as a shortstop. He was the first to reach the mark with a walk-off. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \u201cThere's a lot that defines him, not only moments like this,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cAs soon as he gets to the ballpark, he\u2019s impacting people in a positive way, just his presence, his interactions, the way he pushes people, the way he encourages people \u2014 and not only players, but coaches, support staff, everyone in this building. His presence, you could feel it every time he\u2019s around.\u201d New York built a formidable top of the order, signing outfielder Juan Soto to a record $765 million, 15-year contract and then keeping first baseman Pete Alonso with a $54 million, two-year deal . The Mets lead the NL East ar 13-7 and are 7-1 at Citi Field. \u201cThat\u2019s as tough a one-two-three as you\u2019re going to see just about anywhere in the league,\u201d Cardinals starting pitcher Miles Mikolas said after allowing a tying RBI single in the fifth to Soto, who had been in a 3-for-31 slide. Acquired from Cleveland in January 2021 in the Mets' first big move after Steve Cohen bought the team, Lindor helped build a winning culture in a team that hasn't won the World Series since 1986. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \u201cHe obviously has a lot of leadership in him and he takes on that role really well,\u201d Mets pitcher David Peterson said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t hurt being the best shortstop in the game.\u201d A four-time All-Star, Lindor hit .273 with 33 homers and 91 RBIs last year, a fan favorite who sparks sing-alongs at Citi Field since adopting The Temptations' \u201cMy Girl\u201d as his walk-up song last May. Lindor ended the Mets other other walk-off win this season with a sacrifice fly against Toronto on April 5. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of teammates that just talk the talk and they don\u2019t do what they\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I take it very personal. I take it very \u2014 too hard. If I talk, I mean it. I\u2019m just not just going to talk just for the sake of it.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Asked what went through his mind as he circled the bases, Lindor recalled looking ahead to Saturday and a forecast of balmy conditions. \u201cWe won. We get to go home,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m done with this cold weather.\u201d ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB Advertisement Advertisement About Our Ads Advertisement Advertisement

By: Mike Beiermeister Posted and last updated BROWN DEER, Wis. \u2014 Natasha McCants smiles easily these days, but that wasn't always the case. The past two years have tested her in ways she never imagined after a cancer diagnosis changed everything. \"It was very hard. Very, very hard. It was not an easy road to get to where I'm at now,\" McCants said. In February 2023, at just 45 years old, McCants received devastating news: she had colon cancer, despite having no prior symptoms. \"My first thought is, I have two children, and who needs their mother. So it was fear,\" McCants said. Over the next two years, McCants endured surgery and months of chemotherapy. But her condition worsened, and doctors eventually advanced her diagnosis to stage four after discovering cancer had spread to her lungs and liver. \"They sent me home to die. They said there's nothing else we can do,\" McCants said. Refusing to give up, McCants and her family advocated for a second opinion, which led her to Chief of Medical Oncology Dr. Ajaz Khan, M.D. at City of Hope in Illinois, about an hour away from her home. City of Hope Dr. Ajaz Khan, M.D. The new medical team brought fresh perspective and different treatment options. \"Her DNA tells so much in terms of where the cancer's growing. She has a marker which we can easily treat,\" Dr. Khan said. Now, most of McCants' cancer is gone. Dr. Khan believes that with one final surgery scheduled in less than two weeks, she could be rendered disease-free.

When asked if skipping a wellness check might have cost her life, McCants replied, \"I probably would not have been here.\" Her experience has given her a new outlook on life, and she encourages everyone to prioritize their health and never surrender hope. Mike Beiermeister Natasha McCants \"You have one body, and you have to take care of it,\" McCants said. She credits her faith family as well for uplifting her through prayer like at St. Philip's Evangelical Lutheran Church with Pastor Raymond Kimbrough, Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church, Christian Faith Fellowship Church, Tabernacle Community Baptist Church, and Holy Redeemer Church of God and Christ.

As covered on TechPowerUp's news section earlier on in the week, one rumored \"more budget-friendly\" option could be a lightweight product. Yesterday, Kosutami (@Kosutami_Ito) posited that Apple engineers have realized a thinner design. According to inside information, weight reduction has been achieved through the fitting of select titanium parts\u2014Kosutami highlighted the lighter Vision package's connectors and battery as potential candidates. Industry watchdogs reckon that the rest of this rumored design will rely on (largely) aluminium and plastic pieces. The tipster also teased a \"graphite dark blue\" colorway; harkening back to iPhone 5's Slate Black aesthetic. A theorized \"Vision Air\" label has emerged from Kosutami's recent social media post. back Go To Full Article No comments available. Copyright \u00a9 2001-2011 Madshrimps, All rights reserved.

This week, the trial began in a suit by the FTC claiming that Meta, formerly Facebook, cemented an illegal monopoly in social media through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Reuters Silicon Valley's tech giants have long regarded antitrust scrutiny as an irritating cost of doing business. There will be investigations, filings, depositions and even lawsuits. Yet courts move slowly, while technology rushes ahead. Time works to the companies' advantage, as the political winds shift and presidential administrations change. That dynamic often opens the door to light-touch settlements. But the stakes rose sharply for Google on Thursday, when a federal judge ruled that the company had acted to illegally to build a monopoly in some of its online advertising technology. In August, another federal judge found that Google had engaged in anticompetitive behavior to protect its monopoly in online search. Antitrust experts said two big antitrust wins for the government against a single company in such a short time appeared to have no precedent. \"Two courts have reached similar conclusions in product markets that go to the heart of Google's business,\" said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and former chair of the Federal Trade Commission. \"That has to be seen as a real threat.\" Live Events The Google decisions are part of a wave of current antitrust cases challenging the power of the biggest tech companies. This week, the trial began in a suit by the FTC claiming that Meta , formerly Facebook, cemented an illegal monopoly in social media through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories The government has also sued Apple and Amazon over allegations of anticompetitive behavior. And on Monday, the judge who ruled against Google in August will hear arguments on how to restore competition in the online search engine market. The Justice Department has asked the court to order Google to sell Chrome, its popular web browser, and either spin off Android, its smartphone operating system, or be barred from making its services mandatory on its phones. Google has described the government's request as a \"wildly overboard proposal\" that \"goes miles beyond the court's decision.\" The company suggested that it should change very little. In the ad technology case, the judge gave both sides seven days to propose a schedule for the next phase of the case, which will also involve remedies. The government is likely to ask Google to sell some of its ad tools, the antitrust experts said. Antitrust enforcement has taken an activist turn in recent years, as both the Trump and Biden administrations increased their scrutiny of the biggest tech companies. But filing cases by no means guarantees success. The triumphs by the government in both Google cases, the experts said, signal that the courts are finally grappling with anticompetitive behavior in digital markets. For years, enforcement lagged technology's explosive growth, in part because antitrust law typically focuses on rising prices for consumers. Many internet services are free. The Justice Department's wins against Google are \"important affirmations of the ability of the government to pursue major monopolization cases and prevail -- something there has been doubt about,\" said Nancy Rose, an economist who is an antitrust expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The goal of an antitrust remedy is to free up markets, creating a competitive environment that results in more new ideas, new companies, more innovation and lower prices. The courts have long been reluctant to engage in the drastic surgery of a breakup. In the last major antitrust case against a tech company, the government reached a settlement with Microsoft in 2001, shortly after the George W. Bush administration assumed office. The agreement loosened up Microsoft's contracts on personal computer software, which a court found to be anticompetitive, but left the company intact. While the judges in the Google case will weigh breakup options again, the prospects are uncertain. Shifts in the political climate could also influence the outcome for Google, as they did for Microsoft. So far, aggressive antitrust enforcement has had bipartisan support. The Google search case was filed in the waning days of the first Trump administration, and the ad technology case by the Biden administration. \"It's pretty amazing when you look at the cases filed, the progress so far, and that the government enforcers seem consistently serious,\" said Harry First, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. \"Maybe the tortoise is going to win here.\" Still, the Google rulings are early steps in an uncertain judicial process. Google will appeal both, and has expressed confidence that it will ultimately prevail. The company contends that its strong market position in search and ad technology is the result of innovation and investment -- superior products that consumers value -- and not because of anticompetitive tactics. Either or both of the Google cases may land before the Supreme Court, the experts said. Or the Trump administration could settle them. \"Trump is a deal maker, and that could be where this is headed,\" said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Carey Law School.

Table of Contents It\u2019s not just you; studies have shown that the world is quite literally getting louder . But, thankfully, noise-canceling headphones are getting better every year \u2014 and more portable. The best noise-canceling earbuds can compete with some over-ear options, and they\u2019re a convenient way to take your tunes on the go or simply quiet the noisy outside world. Whether you\u2019re working in a caf\u00e9, riding the train, or on a long-haul flight seated in seat 75B, noise-canceling earbuds are a pocket-friendly option for everyday use. How Does Noise-Canceling Work? Bose is credited as the first company to make noise-canceling headphones commercially available, and, unsurprisingly, they still make some of the best options. The first active noise-canceling (ANC) headphones were designed for use in aviation, but the tech has come a long way. According to Bose , \u201cMiniature microphones in the earcups or earbuds listen to the outside noise frequencies and emit the exact opposite signal to effectively \u201ccancel out\u201d both sets of sounds when the soundwaves collide.\u201d Top to bottom: Nothing, Bose, Sennheiser, Apple AirPods Jonathan Zavaleta/Rolling Stone Of course, as the technology has become more widespread and with more brands offering at least some ANC options, there\u2019s greater variation in quality and performance. That\u2019s why we set out to find the best noise-canceling earbuds. How We Picked the Best Noise-Canceling Earbuds We tested all of the options below in a variety of environments, seeing how they handled everything from noisy jet engines to the hum of the office HVAC to the bustle of city streets. Of course, the ability to silence the outside world isn\u2019t the only criterion for being the best noise-canceling earbuds (for that, you can simply pick up a pair of earplugs ). Instead, we also evaluated factors like audio performance , call quality , comfort, and battery life to find the best noise-canceling earbuds. Read on for our picks. best overall Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds $299.00 Buy Now at bose Buy Now On Amazon Quick Summary : With top-of-the-line, customizable ANC, the QuietComfort Ultra earbuds live up to Bose\u2019s reputation. ANC : 10 adjustable levels, including an \u201cAware\u201d transparency mode Stated Battery Life (ANC On) : 6 hours earbuds/24 hours case Water Resistant : IPX4 The competition for the best noise-canceling headphones is fierce, but Bose is synonymous with noise-canceling for a reason. The QuietComfort Ultra earbuds outperform many over-ear headphones, adeptly handling a variety of noises, from trucks rumbling down the street to human voices. The earbuds feature up to 10 ANC levels, and you can customize up to four as quick-access presets in the Bose app. A long press on the earbud toggles through different modes, and there\u2019s also an aware mode to allow some noises through for awareness. Bose\u2019s QuietComfort earbuds also feature intuitive controls, including a single tap that plays and pauses music, as well as swipe controls to adjust the volume up or down. Reliable in-ear detection also pauses the music when you take an earbud out. Crucially, the earbuds sound great, with good performance at different levels of ANC. The earbuds are also comfortable, thanks to the replaceable ear tips and stabilizer bands that ensure a secure fit. That said, voice-calling performance could be better, and the price may be hard to justify for some. best for iPhone Apple AirPods Pro 2 $189.99 $249.00 24% off Buy Now On Amazon Buy Now at walmart Quick Summary : If you have an iPhone, the AirPods Pro 2 remain one of the best options on the market thanks to top tier ANC and features. ANC Modes : ANC, Transparency, Adaptive, and Off Stated Battery Life (ANC On) : 5.5 hours (spatial audio/headtracking on)/ 30 hours case Water Resistant : IPX4 There\u2019s little reason to buy the AirPods Pro 2 if you don\u2019t have an iPhone; without a companion app, the functionality will be severely limited for Android users. However, if you do have an iPhone, the AirPods Pro 2 remain a no-brainer, even two and a half years after their release. The ANC performance is impressive, as is the audio quality. I found the AirPods Pro 2 cut down a variety of noises, from loud traffic to ambient electrical humming. The AirPods feature transparency, adaptive, and noise-canceling modes to suit different environments, and their controls are intuitive, with a swipe sensor located behind the stem and pinch controls for playback and phone calls. Apple has also rolled out new features for the AirPods Pro 2, including the ability to use them as hearing aids or hearing protection. Additionally, you get features like head-tracking and immersive audio for an enhanced listening experience. There are a few drawbacks, including the lack of customizable EQ and so-so battery life. But overall, the AirPods Pro 2 remain one of the best options for iPhone and iOS users. Also Great Bose QuietComfort Earbuds $179.00 Buy Now at bose Buy Now On Amazon Quick Summary : Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Earbuds are a more affordable alternative to the flagship Ultra earbuds, while still delivering great sound and ANC. ANC Modes : ANC, Aware, and Off Stated Battery Life : Up to 8 hours, 31.5 with the case Water Resistant : IPX4 If you don\u2019t want to shell out $300 for Bose\u2019s flagship QC Ultra earbuds, the brand rolled out an affordable alternative last year . The QuietComfort earbuds have a pod-shaped design and a larger, clamshell case reminiscent of the discontinued earbuds of the same name that Bose released in 2020. At $179, they\u2019re competitively priced, and while the ANC isn\u2019t as robust as the QC Ultra Earbuds, it\u2019s far from underwhelming. I found that it effectively reduced the noise of a busy street, allowing me to enjoy music without having to crank up the volume. There are fewer ANC modes than with the QC Ultras, with just Quiet, Aware, and Off. Surprisingly, the QuietComfort earbuds have some features the more expensive Ultras don\u2019t, including wireless charging in the case. There are some quirky features, too, like the ability to remotely take a photo on your phone using the earbuds as a shutter button. The case is bulky, and it\u2019s slightly annoying to have to download a separate app for these earbuds, as they don\u2019t work with Bose\u2019s main app. However, they deliver solid audio performance and the industry-leading ANC Bose is known for, all in a more affordable package. Best value Nothing Ear (a) $99.00 Buy Now at nothing Buy Now On Amazon Quick Summary : With a stylish design, affordable price, and solid ANC and audio quality, these are excellent everyday earbuds. ANC Modes : 3 levels (low, medium, high), and 3 modes (On, Transparency, and Off) Stated Battery Life (ANC ON) : 5.5 hrs buds, 24.5 hrs case Water Resistant : IP54 Nothing\u2019s Ear (a) earbuds are among my favorite earbuds for everyday use. The compact design is pocket-friendly, and the stylish transparent design is eye-catching, making these earbuds a joy to use. In terms of shape, the earbuds draw clear inspiration from AirPods, featuring a thin stem and pinch controls. They\u2019re lightweight and comfortable in the ear, and the feature-rich app includes customizable EQ and controls. There are four ANC levels: low, mid, high, and adaptive, as well as three modes: ANC on, transparency mode, and off. By default, pinching and holding switches between ANC on and transparency mode, with a quirky exhale sound indicating transparency mode. Setting the ANC strength, however, requires going in the app. At $99, they\u2019re also an impressive value and one of the best earbuds under $100. The battery life is just average, particularly with ANC enabled, and the Nothing Ear (a) does not support wireless charging. Despite some minor drawbacks, the audio quality, rich features, and ANC of these earbuds make them tough to beat at this price point. best sounding Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 $239.95 $299.95 20% off Buy Now at walmart Buy Now at sennheiser Quick Summary : With impressive audio performance and solid ANC, Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless earbuds are ideal for audiophiles. ANC Modes : Adaptive ANC, Anti-wind, Transparency mode with three levels Stated Battery Life: Roughly 7 hours, 30 with the case Water Resistant : IP54 Sennheiser is known for stellar audio performance, and the Momentum 4 True Wireless earbuds deliver on that promise. They also have a luxe feel, with a stylish fabric-covered case and metal accents on the earbuds. The in-ear design is also very comfortable, with a natural and secure fit. While audio-focused brands often excel in sound performance but fall short on software or technology, Sennheiser managed to cover all the bases. The sound quality is up to the standard you\u2019d expect from such a storied brand, with impressive clarity and detail. But the ANC performance was a surprise, and while it doesn\u2019t offer the monastic silence of Bose, the Momentum 4 True Wireless earbuds can capably handle a variety of distractions. The earbuds also feature a transparency mode for situational awareness and adaptive ANC to adjust to your surroundings. As for audio quality, the earbuds boast lossless audio with codecs like aptX and aptX Adaptive. The combination of audio performance, style, and comfort makes the Momentum 4 True Wireless one of my favorite noise-canceling earbuds, despite the bulky case and the availability of stronger ANC. best for workouts Anker Soundcore Sport X20 $79.99 Buy Now at soundcore Buy Now On Amazon Quick Summary : If you need affordable workout earbuds with ANC, Anker\u2019s Soundcore Sport X20 are comfortable and durable. ANC Modes : Three levels and three modes (On, Normal, Transparency), plus Wind Noise Reduction Stated Battery Life (ANC ON) : 7 hrs buds/28 hrs case Water Resistant : IP54 If you\u2019re looking for a pair of workout earbuds with ANC, Anker\u2019s Soundcore X20 earbuds are a great option thanks to features like adjustable noise-canceling and comfortable ear hooks for use at the gym. The earbuds have a physical button, rather than touch controls, which helps prevent accidental presses during workouts. These have remained a top pick for the best earbuds with ear hooks because of the comfortable, flexible fit of the ear hooks. The IP68 rating also makes them durable enough to withstand the toughest workouts. The straightforward Soundcore app allows you to adjust the ANC levels, and the earbuds also have a wind reduction feature for outdoor running or especially breezy days. The Soundcore app also features customizable EQ, and the earbuds deliver up to 7 hours of listening time on a single charge or and 28 in the case with ANC on, and more with ANC off. If there\u2019s room for improvement, it\u2019s the audio quality. The X20 earbuds are solid, but they don\u2019t have the same clarity as earbuds from brands like Apple and Sennheiser. That said, for just $80, you get feature-rich earbuds that are great for workouts and everyday use.

However, Google has now clarified that this isn't live yet, as it doesn't have a user interface at the moment. That will arrive with a later update, and when it does finally become available, it will be an opt-in feature, so it won't be turned on by default, you will have to go into Settings and manually do it yourself if you want it. It's unclear when exactly this will get a UI and will be actually usable, but hopefully sooner, rather than later. Apple has baked something similar into iOS 18.1 last year, and especially if it's opt-in, there's no harm in having it. Once it lands, if you turn it on, it will auto-restart your Android phone or tablet when it's been locked (thus, on but unused) for 72 hours in a row, then putting it into its \"Before First Unlock\" state, where data is encrypted and harder to access than it is if the phone is in the \"After First Unlock\" state which is where it goes after you've entered your passcode upon any restart.

Jelani Remy at the York GALA. Photo Credit: Carol Rosegg. Jelani Remy at the York GALA. Photo Credit: Carol Rosegg. Broadway performer Jelani Remy (\u201cBack to the Future: The Musical\u201d and \u201cAin\u2019t Too Proud\u201d) chatted about his latest endeavors. \u2018The Renaissance GALA\u2019 On being a part of \u201cThe Renaissance GALA\u201d this past Monday (April 14th) at the re-opening of the Laurie Beechman Theatre, Remy said, \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m home, and that my mom and dad have created a great feast for us all to enjoy.\u201d Remy noted that the Laurie Beechman Theatre is of great significance to him. \u201cPersonally, this venue is important to me because I started performing in New York City here in Broadway Sessions,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, I found that they were doing open Cabarets, and this was a spot to be free in a way. It\u2019s like a subculture that is just incredible, necessary, and it is just wonderful,\u201d he added. York GALA A few years ago, he was thrilled to do the York GALA, which honored Tom and Michael D\u2019Angora , who ironically enough, are the new owners of the West Bank Caf\u00e9 and the newly-renovated Laurie Beechman Theatre. \u201cThe York GALA was so much fun, and that\u2019s another connection I made from here,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s family, and it\u2019s a beautiful community.\u201d \u2018Back to the Future: The Musical\u2019 Remy opened up about his experience in the hit Broadway musical \u201cBack to the Future.\u201d \u201cI remember it like it was yesterday,\u201d Remy admitted. \u201cIt was epic and I am so happy that several of my fellow \u2018Back to the Future\u2019 performers are here tonight, Emma Pittman and JJ Niemann.\u201d On his character Goldie, Remy said, \u201cI liked the positivity and the light that he got to shine in the show. He was the people\u2019s choice. He was able to get the crowd pumped up with that wonderful song \u2018You Gotta Start Somewhere\u2019. That role was just so much fun.\u201d Remy had great words about working with lead Casey Like. \u201cCasey is incredible; he is a dream. I am excited to see him continue to soar,\u201d Remy exclaimed.

It had the reach, the hardware, the data, the closed loop ecosystem, it had everything but the need. Now, that\u2019s starting to change. Apple\u2019s quiet rebrand of its search ads business to the more assertive \u201cApple Ads\u201d may seem like a modest semantic update but in the context of platform power plays, language rarely shifts without intention. The move suggests that Apple is no longer content to just collect rent from the ad tech ecosystem it reshaped through privacy policies. It wants a larger piece of the action. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that the rebrand of Apple Search Ads to Apple Ads is simply cosmetic,\u201d said Eric Seufert, independent analyst and investor. \u201cBut a renewed focus on advertising by Apple seems inescapable in light of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\u201d The timing matters. Apple has spent years building its defenses, designing its own chips, overhauling supply chains \u2014 but tariffs on Chinese imports, especially under Trump\u2019s return to the campaign trail, are reintroducing uncertainty. Some products have dodged the impact, others haven\u2019t. And with hardware margins already tight, Apple needs new ways to protect its bottom line. Advertising offers one. It scales quickly. It doesn\u2019t rely on manufacturing. And unlike raising prices on an iPhone, it\u2019s unlikely to provoke customer backlash or regulatory blowback. It\u2019s a high-margin business Apple can grow quickly, leveraging infrastructure it already owns. Apple has always wanted a piece of the ad pie Apple\u2019s interest in advertising isn\u2019t new. From the ill-fated launch of iAd in 2010 to the steady growth of its search business, to its increasingly aggressively dismantling of third-party tracking, Apple has never been indifferent to the ad economy. If anything, it\u2019s history shows a company intrigued by it but cautious about embracing it too directly. Through it all, Apple positioned itself as a privacy champion. That stance gave it both moral authority and regulator insulation even as it laid the groundwork to shape, and now profit from, the advertising industry on its own terms. To some, the new Apple Ads branding might look like a shift away from that ethos. But it\u2019s more likely a continuation of the strategy that\u2019s always defined the company: monetizing its principles on its own terms. \u201cLet\u2019s call it what it is: Apple\u2019s now in the ads business in earnest, and this rebrand lets them hide in plain sight. \u2018Apple Ads\u2019 sounds innocuous, even helpful,\u201d said Eric Shiffman, vp of product marketing at Yieldmo. \u201cBut it\u2019s a signal that a company famous for being the face of privacy is now capitalizing on proprietary signals no one else can access. It\u2019s privacy on their terms and monetization behind the curtain.\u201d For better or worse, marketers are ready for it. They\u2019ve spent years hoping Apple would emerge as a counterweight to Google, Meta and Amazon. But they also knew the pattern. A new player enters, promising control and opportunity, and before long, marketers find themselves locked inside another walled garden \u2014 this time with even less transparency into where their ads show up, how they perform or whether they\u2019re getting what they paid for. \u201cAs alluded to, healthy competition is welcome, but we have also seen Apple create and play by its own rules in its dominant app store ecosystem, where publishers and developers were at odds with Apple,\u201d said Sam Huston, vp of media at Dept. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll be closely following the dynamics and inner workings of the advertising marketplace\u2019s demand and supply sides.\u201d Timing is everything Even before tariffs had entered the conversation, Apple had been quietly laying the groundwork for a more aggressive advertising push. Seufert had unpacked much of this in detail on his Mobile Dev Memo blog but here are the CliffsNotes: last June, Apple renamed its attribution framework SKAdnetwork to the more expansive \u201cAdAttributionKit\u201d, signaling intent to support broader cross-device measurement. Then, Apple added view-through metric to its AdServices APP, functionality that hints at new inventory across non-clickable surfaces like podcasts, maps or even TV. That last point matters. Apple\u2019s struggles to build a sustainable streaming business are well-documented. Despite growing Apple TV subscriptions to 45 million last year, the unit is still losing over $1 billion annually. If nothing else, Netflix and Disney+ have shown that advertising can provide a path to offset content costs without needing to hike prices too high or churn too many subscribers. \u201cThe App Store aside, Apple\u2019s other big services like Music, TV+ and Arcade are all smaller players in their sectors so you wouldn\u2019t expect them to support a huge ads business even if ads were switched on,\u201d said Jamie MacEwan, senior research analyst at Enders Analysis. \u201cThere have been reports of Apple considering an ads tier on Apple TV+, one benefit might be to extend the reach of the product and maintain its market relevance while plugging some of the content spend deficit, but this would still be a tiny player in the context of the US or UK TV advertising markets.\u201d The numbers Last year, Apple\u2019s U.S. ad business totaled $6.47 billion, but only accounted for 2.1% of total digital ad spending, according to eMarketer\u2019s March 2025 forecast. While that percentage for total digital ad spend is expected to stay static at 2.1% through 2025 and 2026, eMarketer has still forecast that the tech giant will rake in $7.42 billion this year (14.7% increase on 2024\u2019s revenue), and $8.21 billion in 2026 (with only a 10.6% increase on 2025\u2019s revenue achievements).

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead As the trade war escalates, narratives about how brands\u2019 goods are made, the factories that produce them and whether they\u2019re worth the price are unfolding across social media. Call it the trade war\u2019s meme war. Narrated videos and AI-generated memes are flooding consumers \u2018 feeds across TikTok, X and YouTube as the U.S. and China battle over tariff increases. This Wednesday, the U.S. imposed a 125% tariff on China. Some Chinese-based influencers and manufacturers are taking to social media in an attempt to expose how luxury goods are made and allegedly shipped off to European countries for labeling and significant mark-ups. They\u2019re hoping consumers instead buy directly from China\u2019s manufacturing facilities. Whether these posts are accurate remains unclear \u2014 and ultimately doesn\u2019t matter, according to four agencies and brand strategists, as they may shift how consumers will shop and perceive major brands that have been named in these posts, from Nike to Lululemon and high-end goods from Chanel to Prada. U.S.-based brands need to have a plan, they say, to respond to the trade war\u2019s meme war \u2014 using social media to be more transparent around their production process, craftsmanship and \u2014 ultimately \u2014 to convince consumers to that their brand value matters. \u201cThe curtain has been pulled back, and it\u2019s very difficult for governments to now control the message,\u201d said Amy Luca, global head of social at marketing and tech consultancy Monks. \u201cIt\u2019s the very first time that a trade war has gone directly to consumers, and the messaging and the battle of that trade war is being fought in social media.\u201d For example, in one video a Chinese influencer goes behind-the-scenes with luxury hand bags like Dior and claims that its cardigans are actually from Beyond Garments in Hangzhou, the capital of China\u2019s Zhejiang Province. She says the supplier is also behind other luxury labels including Sandro, Maje and Versace. LVMH (owner of Dior), SMCP (owner of Sandro and Maje) and Capri Holdings (owner of Versace) did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Beyond Garments is their supplier. Brand transparency and identity Luxury brands have already started to be more transparent about where their goods are made. Last February, for example, Hermes took Vogue inside its leather goods studio near Paris to show how bags are. This month, the luxury brand showed how its watches are made in France behind-the-scenes on YouTube . \u201cI do think you\u2019re seeing an increase in luxury brands spending on really high-quality content production,\u201d said Kirby Brooks Todd, managing director, head of social and influencers for Mekanism, adding that the behind the curtain approach \u201cwill only increase\u201d from these brands. Aside from brands being more transparent, some can use this opportunity play up their local and domestic products that are \u201cMade in the USA\u201d and emphasize their brand identities and stories, Luca explained. As a proactive measure, Monks has been conducting social listening for clients to track industry and consumer sentiments on the evolving tariff situation. In a two week period between March 24 and April 9, it tracked 5.3 million unique mentions of tariffs across social media \u2014 that\u2019s more than double the volume of conversations around Formula 1, which started in March. \u201cBrands either have to choose to not engage in the conversation or continually reinforce why [consumers are] buying the brand name,\u201d Luca said. \u201cThat is everything from not just that individual product, but what the brand stands for.\u201d Some consumers are paying closer attention to the manufacturing process. Some videos from TikTok creators including @lunasourcingchina and @sen.bags question the \u201cmade in\u201d labels from France and Italy, suggesting that some components are completed in China before final assembly elsewhere. ( Newsweek reported that a \u201cMade in Italy\u201d labeling requires that the product\u2019s last substantial transformation to occur in Italy.) The move calls into question how much consumers will care about the manufacturing process behind big brands, noted agency execs. Some brands predict that Gen Z and other younger audiences scrolling TikTok actually don\u2019t buy a lot of these luxury products \u2014and therefore might be insulated from these messages, explained Robin Westerling, CEO at Longvadon, a French-founded luxury Apple Watch band designer. \u201cMany TikTok users can\u2019t afford these types of goods, which is one reason we don\u2019t advertise on this platform,\u201d Westerling said. But Westerling suspects that it could \u201cpermeate\u201d more than luxury goods to affect other common products like shoes and shirts. Questions of value If the viral videos start pushing shoppers to buy directly from manufacturers overseas to get better deals, it could start to dilute the market and make business challenging for some brands. In some posts , Chinese manufacturers and influencers are telling people to message them for more information and links to buy directly from them. \u201cThis can drive down the perceived value of the products, which may make them undesirable across the board,\u201d said Reilly Newman, brand strategist at brand development company Motif Brands. Newman believes that the direct marketing causes people to consider cheaper goods, making other established brands seem less valuable in comparison. Lauren Petrullo, founder and CEO of digital agency Mongoose Media, said \u201cmom and pops and medium-sized businesses\u201d might benefit during this time given they often white label products, and aren\u2019t responsible for manufacturing. \u201cIf you cannot beat on convenience, you have to beat on pricing,\u201d Petrullo said. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re buying directly from the factory, you will never beat on pricing, so you have to win on something else. \u2026 Manufacturers offering direct-to-consumers will win the short-term race, but will not develop any loyalty.\u201d While deals will grab people in this moment, those brands may not get consumers to come back when the sales are over. \u201cIf they\u2019re not [selling] products that resonate to their values and they\u2019re just a commodity, you\u2019re running on borrowed time,\u201d Petrullo said. \u2014 Kristina Monllos contributed reporting.

This also means that the extended launch rebate offer of RM4,000 is expected to end very soon. According to Pro-Net, over 1,800 units of the Proton EV have been delivered so far, making it a market leader in Malaysia\u2019s EV segment. The latest EV registration data from JPJ has recently revealed that 1,738 units of the e.MAS 7 have been registered from January to March, which represents 25% of total EVs registered in Q1 2025. Commenting on the milestone, Pro-Net CEO Mr Zhang Qiang said, \u201cThe e.MAS 7\u2019s success shows what\u2019s possible when we combine global EV expertise with deep local insight. We\u2019ve introduced a vehicle that reflects the needs and aspirations of Malaysian drivers\u2014practical, high-performing, and ready for everyday life.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is just the beginning of Proton\u2019s journey in shaping the nation\u2019s EV landscape.\u201d To recap, the Proton e.MAS 7 is a fully electric 5-seater SUV that goes head to head with the likes of the BYD Atto 3 and the Chery Omoda E5 , both of which have recently gotten a significant price cut. The base Proton e.MAS 7 Prime with a smaller 49.52kWh battery and 345km of WLTP-rated range is currently going for RM105,800 , while the higher-spec Proton e.MAS 7 Premium with the larger 60.22kWh battery and longer 410km WLTP-rated range is going for RM119,800 . These listed prices are inclusive of the RM4,000 launch rebate that\u2019s offered to the first 6,000 buyers. Whichever e.MAS 7 variant you pick, it comes with a front wheel drive motor pushing 160kW (210hp) and 320Nm of torque. Both variants also get the full suite of ADAS systems including intelligent cruise control with lane centering assist. However, the Premium model gets extra features which includes a 16-speaker Flyme audio system, Head-Up display (HUD), panoramic sunroof, ventilated front seats, 256-colour ambient lighting, power tailgate and larger 19\u2033 alloy wheels. The e.MAS 7 uses Geely\u2019s AEGIS Short Blade LFP battery that\u2019s covered by an 8-year/160,000km warranty and Pro-Net offers high-voltage battery replacement if the state of health (SOH) drops below 70% . According to Pro-Net, the e.MAS 7\u2019s battery is durable as it still retains 90.5% health after 921 full charge cycles, which is equivalent to 400,000km of usage. For greater peace of mind, the battery has also passed Proton\u2019s 6-devil test which include fire, flood, freeze, crush, scrape and crash scenarios. It added that the Crash Safety Power-Off System will disconnect the high-voltage system in the event of a collision and it has also passed a water-wading depth test of 400mm, making it well-equipped to handle flash floods in Malaysia. As revealed recently during Pro-Net\u2019s Hari Raya open house session , Proton e.MAS 7 users can look forward to new software updates and fixes which include support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the ability to change the \u201cIce Cream Truck Sound\u201d and a memory setting for the speed limit warning. For a seamless EV charging experience, Pro-Net is also integrating more Charge Point Operators in the Proton e.MAS app. Besides adding Charge+ and RExharge, they will be adding Shell Recharge chargers to the app very soon. With the charger integration, users can find and activate almost 90% of public EV chargers in the country with one single app. If you\u2019re looking for a more compact and more affordable EV option, Proton has confirmed that another new e.MAS model will be introduced by the end of this year. Unlike its rival, the battery will be included in the selling price and there\u2019s no battery leasing required. The new Proton EV is expected to be called the e.MAS 5 that\u2019s based on the Geely Xingyuan .

Google faces rulings over ad tech and Chrome, while Meta defends its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. DOJ and FTC lawsuits against Amazon and Apple proceed. Despite deregulation hopes, Trump's appointees vow strong enforcement, especially in AI, mergers, and content moderation by social platforms. Agencies The Trump administration isn't letting up on the tech giants. On Thursday, a federal judge ruled that Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in some online advertising technology. And on Monday, the Justice Department will argue that a federal judge should separately force Google to sell its Chrome web browser as it kicks off a three-week hearing about how to address the company's search monopoly. All this comes as the Federal Trade Commission opened a roughly three-month courtroom trial this week against Meta over claims that the social media giant snuffed out nascent competitors when it bought Instagram and WhatsApp. Many of these cases, which helped set into motion a new era of antitrust scrutiny, were filed during President Donald Trump's first term in office. They were advanced by the Biden administration, which also filed monopoly lawsuits against Amazon, Apple and Google's ad technology business. Investors in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street hoped that Trump might show technology companies more deference during his second term, as he promised to deregulate industries. Some legal experts think the administration could still take a lighter hand on blocking mergers and set fewer proactive regulations for tech. Live Events But so far, Trump's appointees have promised to continue much of the scrutiny of the biggest tech companies, despite the industry's hopes. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories \"I think that they may not have fully focused on how much the first Trump presidency had to do with setting in motion this reexamination of tech ,\" said Bill Kovacic, a former FTC chair. Here's what to know. Who is in charge of antitrust enforcement now? Trump appointed Andrew Ferguson as chair of the FTC, which enforces antitrust and consumer protection laws. Ferguson, a lawyer who spent much of his career working for powerful Republican senators, has said he wants to increase scrutiny of the ways that social media companies decide to take posts down. Conservatives have complained for years that platforms like Facebook and YouTube disproportionately censor right-leaning viewpoints. \"I will throw every resource the agency has at prosecuting the cases against Big Tech that we've got going,\" Ferguson said in an appearance on the Bloomberg podcast \"Odd Lots\" this year. The new leader of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Gail Slater, a veteran tech and media lawyer, worked in the White House during Trump's first term. She has also pledged to enforce antitrust laws aggressively. \"It's now a bipartisan issue, and there's a consensus around the need for robust antitrust enforcement,\" Slater said at an event hosted this month by Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley startup accelerator, which has pushed for more antitrust scrutiny of the tech giants. Where do the major antitrust lawsuits against the tech giants stand? Five government cases accuse tech companies of maintaining illegal monopolies, and all are moving through the courts. The companies deny the allegations. -- The FTC sued Meta in 2020, arguing that its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 violated the law by using what regulators call a \"buy or bury\" strategy to eliminate its nascent rivals. The trial is expected to last into July and feature testimony from high-profile figures including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. -- The Justice Department sued Google in 2020 over claims that it had a monopoly in online search. A federal judge ruled for the government last year and will convene a three-week hearing on how to address Google's monopoly starting Monday. The government has suggested that the company sell Chrome, among other measures. Google has proposed fewer restrictions and has said it plans to appeal. -- The Justice Department accused Google in 2023 of illegally dominating the advertising technology business. A federal judge heard arguments in that case last year, and a ruling was issued Thursday. Google was found to have been a monopolist. -- The FTC accused Amazon in a 2023 lawsuit of squeezing small merchants that use its marketplace to sell to consumers. A federal judge rejected Amazon's attempt to dismiss the case last year. It is scheduled to go to trial next year. -- The Justice Department sued Apple last year over claims that the company's interwoven ecosystem of technology makes it hard for consumers to ditch their iPhones and iPads . Apple has asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. What about tech industry mergers and acquisitions? The Biden administration tried and failed to block numerous tech deals, including Meta's purchase of a small virtual reality startup, Within. The push to stop acquisitions outraged investors who back small companies that want to cash out by being acquired by a tech giant. Trump's appointees say they want to get out of the way of acquisitions that don't present a competitive problem. Slater has expressed an openness to companies' proposing settlements -- such as selling off similar assets -- which can help resolve concerns about deals. In late January, the Justice Department sued to block the business software company Hewlett Packard Enterprise from buying Juniper Networks, a networking firm, for $14 billion. It was the first lawsuit to challenge a tech deal in Trump's second term. During the first Trump administration, the Justice Department unsuccessfully challenged AT&T's purchase of Time Warner . What does this mean for the artificial intelligence race? Last year, the Justice Department and the FTC agreed to divide up responsibility for investigating whether the biggest players in artificial intelligence were violating antitrust laws. The Justice Department started investigating Nvidia , while the FTC took Microsoft and its partner, OpenAI. It is unclear whether those investigations will result in lawsuits. The Trump administration has promised to clear the way for American companies to develop AI, including rescinding a Biden-era executive order that put guardrails on the use of the technology. The administration has solicited the industry's input on how best to move forward with policy around the technology, an opening that companies and investors took to lobby for fewer rules. \"I think it is extremely important that we protect competition in the AI space, but I think it is equally important that the government not race to regulate AI,\" Ferguson said on Bloomberg TV in March.

Survey Note: In-Depth Analysis of Eric Kim\u2019s Blog Writing Style Eric Kim, a prominent street photographer and blogger, maintains his primary blog at erickimphotography.com , which serves as a platform for sharing insights on photography, personal development, finance, and philosophy. This analysis, conducted on April 17, 2025, examines his writing style across multiple posts to provide a comprehensive understanding, drawing from recent and representative content to ensure relevance. Methodology and Scope The analysis focused on three key posts: the \u201cSTART HERE\u201d page, a recent financial post titled \u201cHow to Conquer the Markets\u201d dated April 10, 2025, and a detailed Stoicism page. These were selected to capture the breadth of his topics and writing approaches, ensuring a robust sample for stylistic evaluation. The content was reviewed for tone, language, structure, content themes, voice, rhetorical devices, references, calls to action, philosophical underpinnings, and promotional elements. Detailed Findings Tone and Language Eric Kim\u2019s writing is consistently direct and opinionated, often employing informal and vivid language to engage readers. For instance, in \u201cHow to Conquer the Markets,\u201d he describes recent market volatility as \u201cthe most hardcore day in the markets of all time,\u201d using phrases like \u201cabsolutely bonkers\u201d to emphasize his point. This informal tone is evident across posts, with expressions like \u201cloosey goosey\u201d in his Stoicism discussion, reflecting a conversational style. His language blends everyday accessibility with technical or philosophical terms, such as referencing \u201cANTIFRAGILE\u201d from Nassim Taleb, making his writing both relatable and intellectually stimulating. Structure and Organization The structure of Kim\u2019s posts varies, showcasing flexibility in his approach. The Stoicism page is organized with clear sections, such as \u201cWhat does stoicism mean?\u201d and \u201cWho is worth reading?\u201d, facilitating an educational tone. In contrast, \u201cHow to Conquer the Markets\u201d adopts a more stream-of-consciousness style, jumping between market analysis, personal investments, and lifestyle advice, yet thematically connected. This variability suggests Kim adapts his structure to the post\u2019s purpose, whether educating or reflecting, which enhances reader engagement. Content and Themes Kim\u2019s content is multifaceted, covering street photography, finance (e.g., Bitcoin and market trends), and philosophy (e.g., Stoicism). In the \u201cSTART HERE\u201d page, he encourages readers interested in Stoicism to start a blog, blending personal development with practical advice. \u201cHow to Conquer the Markets\u201d discusses recent tariffs and their impact on companies like Apple, linking to Bitcoin investments, while the Stoicism page explores historical figures like Seneca and modern applications, such as entrepreneurship. This diversity reflects his broad interests and his ability to connect disparate topics, such as tying physical fitness to philosophical resilience. Voice and Personal Engagement His writing is predominantly first-person, with a personal and self-disclosing voice. In \u201cHow to Conquer the Markets,\u201d he shares personal investment experiences, like past losses of $3,500 trading penny stocks, and current margin positions, adding authenticity. The Stoicism page includes his discovery journey, influenced by Taleb\u2019s \u201cANTIFRAGILE,\u201d which personalizes the content and builds rapport with readers. Rhetorical Devices and Emphasis Kim frequently uses rhetorical devices to enhance engagement. He employs rhetorical questions, such as \u201cWhy would you need to externally validate yourself?\u201d in the \u201cSTART HERE\u201d page, to provoke thought. Capitalization for emphasis, like \u201cANTIFRAGILE\u201d in financial posts, underscores key concepts. His strong assertions, such as claiming Donald Trump may be \u201cthe best economic president of all time,\u201d reflect confidence, though they may polarize readers, aligning with his opinionated style. References and Cultural Connections He often references public figures, historical philosophers, and popular culture to enrich his arguments. In the Stoicism page, he cites Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, and Diogenes, while also mentioning movies like 300 and John Wick 3 to illustrate points, such as ideal physical fitness. In financial posts, he references Ray Dalio and Sam Bankman-Fried, adding credibility and contemporary relevance, which broadens the appeal of his writing. Calls to Action and Motivational Elements A recurring theme is motivating readers to take action. In the \u201cSTART HERE\u201d page, he urges readers to \u201cstart your own blog\u201d for sharing Stoic thoughts, emphasizing open-source sharing over traditional publishing. \u201cHow to Conquer the Markets\u201d recommends subscribing to X premium or Grok premium for news and suggests investing strategies, such as buying MSTR stock, aligning with his philosophy of empowerment and financial independence. Philosophical Underpinnings Kim\u2019s writing is underpinned by philosophical concepts, notably Stoicism, decentralization, and resilience. The Stoicism page explores fear-conquering and emotional mastery, linking to street photography and entrepreneurship. In financial posts, he advocates for Bitcoin as a decentralized asset, reflecting his belief in \u201copen source, free and permissionless\u201d systems, a theme echoed across posts. Promotional Integration He seamlessly integrates promotion of his own products and services. The Stoicism page recommends Titan.fitness equipment for physical fitness, while \u201cHow to Conquer the Markets\u201d encourages subscriptions to his newsletter and workshops, detailed at workshops . This integration is subtle, enhancing his blog\u2019s utility without detracting from content value. Comparative Insights Across the analyzed posts, Kim\u2019s style remains consistent in its directness and informality, with variations in structure reflecting content purpose. The \u201cSTART HERE\u201d page and Stoicism post are more educational, while \u201cHow to Conquer the Markets\u201d is reflective and advisory, showcasing his versatility. His personal engagement and calls to action are constant, reinforcing his role as an inspirer and educator.

I was even invited to \" Lock and Code \" podcast to talk about geolocation data and privacy. Ok, enough with the bragging. I went through the process described in my initial post and decided to make it faster and more scalable: manually going through hundreds of requests in Charles was very cool for research and educational purposes, but it also took me a lot of time to find \"interesting\" requests coming from a single app. I've significantly upgraded my approach (though it could definitely be more efficient), and in this post I wanted to share it with you. TL;DR I have created a small guide and a Python notebook that allow anyone to record mobile app traffic and find surprising things in it. Here's the link to a GitHub repo with it. The initial setup takes 10-30 minutes. Analysis using this algorithm took me about 10 minutes per app - you can definitely dig deeper and get lost for hours if you find something interesting in there.. Follow the readme or the guide below if you'd like to try! I came up with an idea : it would take me hundreds of hours to go through each app and record the traffic, though I would love to do that \u2013 let's not blindly trust some table from the internet, but find out for ourselves. I copied the Gravy Analytics Google Sheet and created a simple form that you can fill in (no personal info is collected) that writes to that Google Sheet Link to the table Look up any app you already have on your phone or just a random one in the table, check if others have commented on it already and record the traffic. Finally, if you want to help crowdsource the information on the kinds of data the apps from the list collect and share \u2013 fill in the form : I found something interesting in the app traffic Hey! I don\u2019t know how much people will go through with all the instructions and analysis, but since you\u2019re here, you probably already did it and found something. Thanks for being here and doing this. Fill in the form below and your response will be recorded to a shared spreadsheet. PLEASE CHECK ALL OF YOUR INPUTS FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. This form is set in a way that I collect nothing personal from you (like email or Google account or whatever), but your response will be viewable by virtually anyone - so be aware! Google Docs Please edit all the private information in your submission (in case it's there). Visualising \"domain power\" Before jumping into the guide, I wanted to share a few cool-looking visualisations with you. Long story short: lately I've been obsessed with graph visualisations of things, especially branchy-embedded ones. While analysing the traffic I found myself curious: how are the adtech companies domains distributed across all of the requests? So I joined these two together and created a visualisation using PyVis that would answer that question: Here's some context: Every circle is a domain or a subdomain. The hierarchy is represented by the inclusion of circles into others. Example: o-sdk.ads.unity3d.com is represented by 3 circles: o-sdk inside of ads inside of unity3d . Colors represent the app (I analysed 5) that the request corresponds to. I used low opacities for better visibility, and it turns out that in my mix of colors and their opacities purple is the combination of all of them. Circle sizes, or masses, represent the frequency: how often did this or that domain appear in the requests data. See any insights? Unity rules the mobile game app traffic scene. For comparison, the g / doubleclick thing is Google Ad Network. Take a look at it in motion: I included the code for it \u2013 visualise_domains.ipynb in the same repo so that you could create the same visualisation out of the data you record. I also included the ad_domains.html file with this sample (mine) graph \u2013 simply open it in your browser if you want to play around with it. I also was curious of the density of the requests \u2013 in my last post, I mentioned that hundreds of requests happen in just a few seconds, and now I could finally take a look at them: Filenames in the legend are flows collected from 5 different games. I cut it at 60s for better visibility, but obviously there were requests after that as well. This one is again a different view of the domain power \u2013 look at the list on the right. It should be obvious by now that Unity is the leader in this strange contest \u2013 it has the most subdomains called and the most requests made to. Applovin is a Palo Alto-based company that acquired above mentioned Adjust in 2021, has shown $1.58 bln net income in 2024 , and decided to get rid of it's mobile games development products and focus on its advertising business just a few months ago. Doubleclick.net is Google Ads And surprisingly, Facebook, that I've seen in the requests from every single game, is in the last place among these. Well, at least based on this strange metric observed on 5 examples Now that you've seen these obscure but good-looking graphs - let's move on to the actual guide that you could follow to analyse any app traffic. Getting started Step 1: Install mitmproxy on your PC mitmproxy is an open-source tool for intercepting traffic with wide capabilities and a surprisingly nice web version called mitmweb . Be aware that mitmproxy is recognised as malware by some anti-virus apps - looks scary, but it's not. Go to their official downloads page and choose whatever installation way you like more. On Mac, for example, you can simply run brew install mitmproxy . After installation run this command to start mitmweb (mitmproxy + web interface): mitmweb --listen-host 0.0.0.0 --listen-port 8080 You can also use mitmproxy CLI, but I prefer mitmweb because it is actually very helpful for initial discovery (and understanding the scale of the RTB requests). We use --listen-host 0.0.0.0 to avoid mitmproxy starting in the default location, which is localhost 128.0.0.1 \u2013 this way, you don't record your PC traffic and will see 0 requests until you complete the next step. Step 2: prepare your mobile device What you'll need to do is to then setup proxy on your iPhone / Android device and install + trust a certificate. I focused on iOS in my instruction, but setting up an Android phone for the same experiment is even easier and is well-documented - for example, here . I believe you might need to turn on the developer mode, otherwise you won't have Certificate Trust in your settings. Or maybe not. Anyway, if it's missing from your settings - here's a guide on how to do it. By the way, your iPhone and computer must be in the same wifi network for all of this to work. Step 3: start collecting requests! Run ipconfig getifaddr en0 to find your PC local IP address. Next, open the wifi network settings on iPhone, scroll down and setup manual proxy with: server = the ip address you just found port = 8080 On iPhone, open browser and go to mitm.it further instructions are described here: https://jasdev.me/intercepting-ios-traffic or here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/102390 What is this for? You need to install the certificate and enable full trust to be able to decrypt TLS-encrypted traffic. Otherwise you'll just see a bunch of encrypted packets flowing in and out. Congrats! If you completed all the steps correctly, you should now see requests in the mitmweb interface. If you only want to record traffic coming from a specific app, close all apps, \"Clear flows\" and then open the desired app. If you don't have an app installed yet, you might have to turn off proxy on iPhone, download the app and then turn it on again and clear the flows - AppStore refused to work with proxy on for me. If you don't have anything specific on your mind \u2013 pick any app with \"Checked = False\" in the \"original list\" sheet. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fJbNT-kmfuWUlIpYr9sduvjZS1ggrmhydCzoDlqaMaA/ Let's find something interesting All right, now we can record the data! You can already find interesting requests manually - for example, I'm pretty sure you'll see this Facebook request no matter what app you analyse: But looking through the requests in mitmweb , even with ok (not advanced) filtering is a very slow process. And you'll see \u2013 there will be hundreds (if not thousands) of requests in just a few minutes. When you feel like there's enough (you could even leave it open or play for an hour or so to collect more data), close the app and switch off the phone, then in mitmweb press File \u2192 Save. This will give you a flows file - rename it as appname.flow . Filtering & analysing the data Open the mitm_test.ipynb - either in a local Jupyter Notebook or in Google Colab (or wherever you work with .ipynb s). Personally, I feel much more comfortable working with this kind of data in the local environment. However, if you don't code at all / don't use python, e.t.c. \u2013 believe me, there's nothing faster and easier than opening up Colab and importing the file. There are quite clear and broad instructions in the file, so I won't repeat the full process, but just highlight a few things: A very important step - fill in as many keywords as you have on your mind. I was strictly focused on IP and geo data, but you might want to look for other things, like \"screen_brightness\", \"IDFA\" or whatever. Please note that these will only return the exact matches (imagine an amount of words / strings where \"lat\" or \"lon\" would be substrings). Now that you've put all the keywords in the list, run the cells below and it will create a df_filtered table with the requests (or responses) that match the keywords. Here you'll see a snippet of the match ( matched_in_request and matched_in_response ), as well as the \"reason\" for both cases - the keyword(s) that are in the match. Below is a simple .loc where you can input the index of the row (the first column on the left) and see the full value of a given column \u2013 in the example below, \"full_reponse\" . If the string was too long, I just copied it to Sublime Text and use their built-in search to find more context or other surprising data points in the request or response text. And that's it! Finally, if you want to help crowdsource the information on the kinds of data the apps from the list collect and share \u2013 fill in the form : I found something interesting in the app traffic Hey! I don\u2019t know how much people will go through with all the instructions and analysis, but since you\u2019re here, you probably already did it and found something. Thanks for being here and doing this. Fill in the form below and your response will be recorded to a shared spreadsheet. PLEASE CHECK ALL OF YOUR INPUTS FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. This form is set in a way that I collect nothing personal from you (like email or Google account or whatever), but your response will be viewable by virtually anyone - so be aware! Google Docs Please edit all the private information in your submission (in case it's there). Room for improvement? I know this is a very primitive way of doing things \u2013 I could've done this all with mitmdump and automated saving / filtering straight to .csv, but I deliberately kept it semi-manual. The format and structure of all these requests and responses is very diverse and the further you go from looking at them manually, the higher chance you'd miss something. At first I tried filtering out by content type and encoding, but I've noticed that some of the matching requests are missing from the list. So I turned off the filters... and found this: gs-loc.apple.com is an endpoint used by Apple to request user's location information. It was called during a 3-minute recording of the traffic from a single opened app - Make More game. It didn't turn up ever before [when I was analysing other apps] + this game is on the Gravy list. However, I don't want to make false claims saying that this app was responsible for Apple's request \u2013 that endpoint is not accessible directly for any app except for iOS itself, so in order to get the information from it an app needs to call a dedicated Apple API method and have corresponding permissions. Or maybe not? Anyway, the response to this request was encoded in protobuf format, so I had to find a way to decode it, obviously. And I found it.

As soon Everyone knows your location: tracking myself down through in-app ads Recently I read about a massive geolocation data leak from Gravy Analytics, which exposed more than 2000 apps, both in AppStore and Google Play, that secretly collect geolocation data without user consent.

It brought new tools like Writing Tools and Genmoji for users. These tools work in most apps and text fields by default. Users noticed that these options are missing in Meta\u2019s iOS apps. Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp do not show these tools anywhere. Other apps like X and Reddit let users access them. Meta apps do not let users use Apple Intelligence\u2019s Writing Tools. This means proofreading, rewriting, or summarizing text is not possible in posts or messages. Genmoji and iOS keyboard stickers are also not available in Instagram Stories. Meta has not given an official reason for blocking these tools. Reports say Meta wants users to try its own Meta AI, which runs on Llama LLM instead of Apple\u2019s tools. Developers can choose to turn off Apple Intelligence in their apps, and Meta has done this. Credits: sorcererhat The rivalry between Apple and Meta is not new. Both companies have disagreed on privacy, data, and App Store rules. Talks about adding Meta\u2019s Llama model into Apple Intelligence did not work out due to privacy concerns. Meta has also stopped supporting iOS keyboard stickers and Memoji in Instagram Stories. This step makes Meta\u2019s platforms less connected to Apple\u2019s ecosystem. Users now see prompts to use Meta AI, such as \u201cWrite with Meta AI,\u201d in Instagram. For now, iOS users cannot use Apple Intelligence\u2019s Writing Tools or Genmoji in any Meta app. These tools still work in most other apps, but Meta AI tools are now promoted instead. There is no sign that Meta will change this soon. Apple is looking at adding other AI models like Google\u2019s Gemini in the future. The situation may change if business needs or user demand grows.

Written by David Delima | Updated: 14 April 2025 14:20 IST Photo Credit: Meta Meta's Orion smart glasses prototype was unveiled in September 2024 Highlights Apple's CEO is reportedly focused on AR glasses development The firm is looking to beat Meta, which currently offers cheaper devices Apple has yet to officially reveal any plans to make a new AR wearable Advertisement Apple CEO Tim Cook has reportedly made the development of true augmented reality (AR) glasses a \"top priority\" for the company, Bloomberg journalist Mark Gurman writes in his weekly Power On newsletter. The company has yet to officially confirm plans to work on a pair of AR glasses, while rivals like Google, Meta, and Snapchat have showcased prototypes of smart glasses that resemble a pair of spectacles. Unlike larger (and heavier) mixed reality headsets, AR glasses require advanced technology that must be made affordable in order to appeal to customers. Apple Debating Whether to Allow AR Glasses to Capture Media Citing an source, Gurman states that Cook is focused on developing an \"industry-leading product\" before Meta, and has been spending a lot of time on the purported AR glasses. Meta has already showcased an AR glasses prototype dubbed 'Orion', and a commercial version of the device is expected to debut in the coming years. The Facebook parent firm currently offers the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, which do not include an AR component that displays text and other information. However, these glasses allow users to capture images using a camera and microphone. According to Gurman, Apple has also been working on similar wearables, but it is \"actively debating\" whether the smart glasses should be allowed to capture media. Apple Reportedly Facing These Challenges While Developing Its AR Glasses While it's unclear whether Apple will launch camera-equipped spectacles like the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, previous reports indicate that the company is working on equipping other wearables with cameras \u2014 like the Apple Watch. If Apple is successful in developing true AR glasses, the company will have to compete with other firms like Google, Meta, and Snapchat. Last week, Google showed off an XR glasses prototype at TED 2025 that can scan text and offers a 'Memory' feature. It could debut as a Samsung product by next year. Snapchat Spectacles Get GPS-Powered AR Lenses, New Hand Tracking Features Apple Vision Pro 2 Could Be in Development With This Notable Upgrade Apple Said to Stop Development of AR Glasses for Mac Computers Apple's AR Glasses to Come With New Version of visionOS: Report Meta also showcased a pair of smart glasses that is referred to as 'Orion', and the company is expected to launch a commercial version (codenamed Artemis) by 2027. Snap's fifth-generation AR glasses or Spectacles were unveiled in 2024 , but there's no word on when availability will be expanded from developers to customers.

[via press release from FOX Nation] FOX NATION TO DEBUT \"GREG GUTFELD'S WHAT DID I MISS?\" IN MAY Gutfeld Tests Contestants on Real Versus Fake Headlines from the First 90 Days of Trump Administration After a Three-Month Isolation Period NEW YORK - April 14, 2025 - Greg Gutfeld, host of the eponymous number one late night show Gutfeld! and co-host of cable's most-watched program The Five, will helm a three-part game show series for FOX Nation entitled \"Greg Gutfeld's What Did I Miss?\" The first of three episodes will drop on Monday, May 12th followed by episode two and three dropping on May 13th & 14th respectively. From January 20th through April 13th of this year, four contestants were in complete isolation in upstate New York, with no contact to the outside world - no phones, internet, television, or social media. Upon their return to society, the contestants compete in an epic showdown as they are tasked with figuring out what actually happened during their seclusion. Gutfeld will present dozens of scenarios, and the contestants must separate real headlines from fake ones. With a prize of $50,000 on the line, their instincts and senses of humor will be put to the test in front of a live audience and a panel featuring Gutfeld! regulars Kat Timpf and Jamie Lissow. In making the announcement, FOX Nation President Lauren Petterson said, \"Truth can be stranger than fiction and who better to help isolated Americans catch up on the headlines they missed during an unprecedented news cycle than Greg Gutfeld. We are excited for FOX Nation subscribers to have exclusive access to America's most-watched late night host's game show debut as he informs contestants about what really happened while they were completely off the grid and isolated from the outside world.\" Gutfeld added, \"For these four contestants to learn what really happened while they were living in isolation, they'll have to get through me first. Lucky them.\" Gutfeld! (10-11 PM/ET) just delivered its highest-rated quarter in the program's four-year history with 3.3 million viewers, 453,000 in the 25-54 demo and 287,000 in the 18-49 demo. The hit show outpaced all broadcast and late-night television, including CBS' The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, NBC's The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Late Night with Seth Meyers, CBS' After Midnight and Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. In addition to his late-night role, Gutfeld serves as co-host of cable's highest-rated program The Five (5-6 PM/ET) which averaged 4.6 million viewers in 1Q '25 and topped all programs on cable for the last 14 consecutive quarters. As one of the five original hosts when the program launched in 2011, Gutfeld and the ensemble, which includes Harold Ford Jr., Dana Perino, Jeanine Pirro, Jessica Tarlov and Jesse Watters, discuss news stories, controversies, and issues of the day in spirited and spontaneous format which has become appointment viewing on cable.

Tycoon2FA, a phishing kit discovered in 2023 by cybersecurity firm Sekoia, was recently updated to improve its evasion capabilities. The phishing kit now uses advanced evasion tactics such as a custom CAPTCHA via HTML5 canvas, invisible Unicode in obfuscated JavaScript, and anti-debugging scripts to bypass detection and hinder analysis. \u201cLately, the Tycoon 2FA landing pages have incorporated a clever obfuscation technique using invisible Unicode characters. This technique, when paired with JavaScript Proxy objects, is designed to complicate static analysis and defer script execution until runtime.\u201d reported Trustwave . \u201cThis behavior is demonstrated in a real-world Tycoon 2FA phishing landing page, as shown in this Urlscan.io session: https://urlscan.io/result/0195c73f-bfd0-7000-8386-94b11ace6088/dom/ \u201c Source: Trustwave \u2013 Tycoon 2FA using invisible Unicode characters to encode JavaScript code. The obfuscation is actually quite simple but clever. Tycoon 2FA replaced third-party CAPTCHAs like Cloudflare Turnstile with a custom HTML5 canvas-based solution. This improvement allows for evading detection, reduces fingerprinting, and hinders automated analysis using randomized text, noise, and distortions. The Phishing-as-a-Service platform uses anti-debugging scripts to block dev tools, detect automation, prevent right-click, and spot paused execution. If analysis is suspected, it redirects to rakuten.com boosting evasion and extending phishing campaign lifespans. \u201cThe recent updates to the Tycoon 2FA kit show a clear move toward stealth and evasion. While none of these techniques are groundbreaking individually, their combined use can complicate detection and response.\u201d concludes the report that includes Yara rule for detection. \u201cSecurity teams should consider behavior-based monitoring, browser sandboxing, and a deeper inspection of JavaScript patterns to stay ahead of these tactics.\u201d Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini ( SecurityAffairs \u2013 hacking, phishing) facebook linkedin twitter Cybercrime Hacking hacking news information security news IT Information Security malware PhaaS Pierluigi Paganini Security Affairs Security News Tycoon2FA PhaaS you might also like Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Read more Pierluigi Paganini April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Read more leave a comment newsletter Subscribe to my email list and stay up-to-date! recent articles Hertz disclosed a data breach following 2024 Cleo zero-day attack Data Breach / April 15, 2025 Gladinet flaw CVE-2025-30406 actively exploited in the wild Hacking / April 15, 2025 New malware \u2018ResolverRAT\u2019 targets healthcare, pharmaceutical firms Malware / April 14, 2025 Malicious NPM packages target PayPal users Security / April 14, 2025 Tycoon2FA phishing kit rolled out significant updates Cyber Crime / April 14, 2025 We use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.

Everything You Need to Know", "content": "How Accurate Is iPhone Battery Health? - Geeky Gadgets Skip to main content Skip to secondary menu Skip to primary sidebar Skip to footer The accuracy of iPhone battery health metrics has become a topic of growing interest and concern among users and experts alike. Apple provides tools designed to help you monitor your battery\u2019s condition, but questions about the reliability of these metrics persist. If you rely on your iPhone for daily activities, understanding how battery health is measured and its implications is essential for maintaining your device\u2019s performance and longevity. The video below from iReviews gives us more details about iPhone battery health. Watch this video on YouTube . Are Battery Health Metrics Reliable? Apple\u2019s battery health feature, accessible through the settings menu, aims to provide a clear snapshot of your battery\u2019s condition. However, many users have reported discrepancies between the battery health percentage displayed and their device\u2019s actual performance. For instance, your iPhone might indicate a high battery health percentage, yet you could still experience slower performance, reduced efficiency, or even unexpected shutdowns. These inconsistencies can create confusion, leaving you uncertain about the true state of your battery. The reliability of these metrics is further complicated by the fact that battery health is influenced by multiple factors, such as usage patterns, environmental conditions, and the natural aging process of lithium-ion batteries. While Apple\u2019s system provides a general guideline, it may not always reflect the full picture of your battery\u2019s performance. Understanding Battery Cycles and Their Role A battery cycle is defined as one complete charge and discharge cycle, and Apple states that iPhone batteries are designed to retain up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 cycles. This specification is intended to give you a benchmark for when your battery might start to degrade noticeably. However, some users have observed discrepancies between the reported cycle count and their device\u2019s actual performance. For example, your iPhone might report fewer cycles than expected for its age, yet still exhibit signs of reduced battery capacity, such as shorter usage times or slower responsiveness. These mismatches can make it challenging to determine when maintenance or replacement is necessary. Understanding battery cycles is crucial because they directly impact your device\u2019s ability to hold a charge and perform efficiently over time. How Battery Degradation Affects Performance As your battery health declines, particularly below the 80% threshold, you may begin to notice significant performance issues. These can include slower app loading times, reduced responsiveness, and even unexpected shutdowns during tasks that require higher power. While Apple\u2019s battery health feature is designed to warn you when your battery\u2019s capacity has diminished, these performance issues can sometimes occur even when the reported health percentage appears acceptable. For older devices, the combination of aging hardware and a deteriorating battery can exacerbate these problems. This can lead to a frustrating user experience, as your iPhone may struggle to keep up with everyday tasks. If you encounter these symptoms, replacing the battery is often the most effective way to restore your device\u2019s performance and extend its usability. Third-Party Monitoring Tools: Helpful or Misleading? To gain additional insights into their battery\u2019s condition, some users turn to third-party monitoring tools or shortcuts that analyze analytics data. These tools can provide information such as cycle counts, capacity estimates, and other metrics not readily available through Apple\u2019s settings. However, the data provided by these tools is not always consistent with Apple\u2019s metrics, leading to further confusion. For example, a third-party tool might report a lower battery capacity or a higher cycle count than what your iPhone displays. This lack of uniformity highlights the challenges of accurately assessing battery health, even with external tools. While these tools can be helpful in some cases, it\u2019s important to approach their results with caution and use them as supplementary information rather than definitive evidence. When Should You Replace Your Battery? If your iPhone\u2019s performance has noticeably declined and the battery health metrics seem unreliable, replacing the battery is often the best solution. A new battery can significantly improve your device\u2019s speed, responsiveness, and overall usability. Apple offers battery replacement services, but there are also third-party options available. When choosing a replacement service, it is crucial to ensure that the technician is qualified and uses genuine parts. Using counterfeit or low-quality batteries can lead to further issues, including safety risks and reduced performance. Replacing your battery at the right time can extend your iPhone\u2019s lifespan and help you avoid the need for a full device upgrade. How to Stay Ahead of Battery Issues To maintain your iPhone\u2019s performance and avoid unexpected battery-related problems, consider taking the following steps: Regularly monitor your battery health through the settings menu to stay informed about its condition. Pay attention to performance changes, such as slower app response times, shorter battery life, or unexpected shutdowns. Use third-party monitoring tools cautiously, as their data may not always align with Apple\u2019s metrics and could lead to confusion. Replace your battery when performance issues become significant, especially if your device is older or the battery health percentage drops below 80%. Adopt good charging habits, such as avoiding extreme temperatures and overcharging, to prolong your battery\u2019s lifespan. Why Understanding Battery Health Matters The accuracy and reliability of iPhone battery health metrics are critical for making sure your device remains functional and efficient. While Apple\u2019s tools provide a useful starting point, they are not without limitations. By staying informed about how battery health is measured, recognizing the signs of degradation, and taking proactive steps to address issues, you can maximize your iPhone\u2019s performance and longevity. Whether through regular monitoring, cautious use of third-party tools, or timely battery replacement, understanding battery health enables you to make informed decisions and keep your device running smoothly.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . The S&P 500 plunged over 10% before rebounding 9.5% after tariff changes. Despite volatility, financial advisors urge clients to stay calm and stick to investment plans. Advisors highlight tax-loss harvesting and IRA conversions as strategies during volatility. It's been a busy week and a half for financial advisors, as their clients' portfolios have seen historic moves. The S&P 500's 10.5% plunge from April 3 to 4 was among the steepest two-day drops ever recorded in market history. The skyrocketing comeback on Wednesday, after President Donald Trump lifted his excess tariffs for most countries, brought the largest point increases in a single session for the three major indexes. By Thursday, the selling had resumed in a big way. These ground-shaking market moves spooked investors into reaching out to their advisors, according to professionals in the industry who spoke to Business Insider. \"We are taking a lot of client phone calls, for sure,\" said Tyler Meyer, a certified financial planner and the founder of Retire to Abundance. Amid the volatility, the advisors said they are stressing to clients not to panic and to stick to a pre-decided plan \u2014 which will be different for each investor. Here are some other ways the money managers are guiding their clients through all of the mayhem. Communicating early A common theme was the importance of being available to clients \u2014 whether that means sending out email blasts or being responsive to calls. Chris Hernandez at Strategic Capital Powered by Waterloo said he's calling clients himself before they reach out. \"During times like this, we really try to be proactive versus reactive and send a lot of communications out via email,\" he said. \"For our clients that we know like higher touch points, we're just kind of calling them and reminding them of the strategies we put into place.\" Keeping an eye out for tax advantages A sell-off is a good opportunity to save money on taxes going forward, according to Tyler Meyer, the founder of Retire to Abundance. Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know He said he's been guiding clients through potential tax-loss-harvesting opportunities, for example. When an investor has a stock position that is down, they can sell it at a loss and discount that loss from their total taxable income the following year. After selling, they can buy the investment back after 30 days. A market correction could also be a good opportunity to convert a traditional IRA or a 401(k) \u2014 which are taxed upon withdrawals \u2014 to a Roth IRA. The latter is taxed up front instead of when withdrawals are made. When the market is down, the tax bill that results from the conversion would naturally be lower than it would when gains are at their highest. Explaining the macroeconomic landscape Bryan Kuderna, founder of Kuderna Financial Team, sent a letter to clients on April 4 providing an overview of the macroeconomic picture, including a lesson on tariffs, what the best and worst-case scenarios would be for investors, his personal outlook, and the risks of buying and selling in this market. \"My goal is to bring you up to speed, add some clarity during unclear times, and offer some peace of mind,\" he wrote in the letter. Reminding clients of prior downturns It can be easy to forget the feeling of panic that emerges during a slide in prices because there are often years between major sell-offs. \"People forget in good times how ugly and volatile things can get,\" said Melissa Cox, the owner of Future-Focused Wealth. But it's important to remember that the market eventually recovers, and sometimes quite quickly \u2014 which investors don't want to miss out on, said Chris Chen of Insight Financial Strategists. \"In 1987 it dropped 22%\" in a single day, he pointed out. \"And then it bounced back up immediately.\" He added: \"I think it's really dangerous to be out of the market right now.\" Taking profits and preserving clients' peace of mind Hernandez works with many Apple employees. As shares of the smartphone producer have gotten hammered by 23% thanks to tariffs, Hernandez has helped his clients execute a plan to sleep a little better at night. Many of his clients have built up a stockpile of shares in the company over many years, and he said some of them have decided to cut their positions by 15-20% to take a portion of their profits off the table. \"I always say money is both logical and emotional, so logically maybe they feel like they should hold onto the stock, but it's keeping them up at night,\" he said.

Five units will be put into service at Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) Terminal 1, ferrying customers from gate G1 at the main terminal building to gate C1 at the satellite terminal. The service complements the usual shuttle bus transfer and mirrors the one offered by Malaysia Airlines for its Business Class, utilising the Mercedes-Benz EQS500 and S580e to ply the same route. The shuttles are necessary because the airport\u2019s aerotrains are still in the midst of being replaced, having been delayed once again from the planned January completion date. It was last reported that the trains are due to begin service in the current quarter, per Malay Mail . \u201cTravel should be effortless, and at Batik Air, we believe our Business Class guests deserve nothing less,\u201d said Batik Air CEO Chandran Rama Muthy. \u201cThis VIP Transfer Service isn\u2019t just about moving between terminals\u2014it\u2019s about redefining the journey with innovation, care and a touch of exclusivity.\u201d Stellantis ASEAN managing director Isaac Yeo added: \u201cThe Leapmotor C10 redefines premium travel, delivering unparalleled comfort and sophistication for discerning passengers. This exceptional electric SUV embodies our vision for environmentally responsible mobility while offering a seamless and refined experience\u2014both on the road and beyond the airport tarmac.\u201d The C10 is the first local offering from Chinese brand Leapmotor, priced at RM159,700 on-the-road without insurance. For that money, you get a single rear motor that produces 218 PS (160 kW) and 320 Nm, enough to get the D-segment crossover from zero to 100 km/h in 7.5 seconds on its way to a top speed of 170 km/h. A 69.9 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery provides a WLTP range of 424 km. The massive 4,759 mm long five-seater SUV comes standard with full-LED lighting, sporty 20-inch \u201cTrident\u201d alloy wheels, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, a 14.6-inch centre touchscreen, Oeko-Tex faux leather upholstery, dual-zone climate control, heated and ventilated power-adjustable front seats, a Qi wireless charger, 12 speakers, a 360-degree camera system a powered tailgate, seven airbags and Level 2 semi-autonomous driving capabilities.

AI image: Midjourney/Cult of Mac After the U.S. government seemed to exempt iPhones, Macs and other electronics from hefty tariffs Friday, a clarification issued Sunday by President Donald Trump revealed that\u2019s not the case. Trump said on Truth Social that his administration did not announce a tariff exemption Friday. Instead, the \u201cexisting 20% Fentanyl Tariffs\u201d will still apply to electronics \u2014 with higher tariffs possibly coming soon. Nope, Trump did not exempt iPhones and Macs from reciprocal tariffs Since taking office, President Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on all major manufacturing countries with heavy import tariffs. True to his word, he announced a significant increase in import tariffs last week on goods imported from major Asian manufacturing hubs. The president eventually backtracked, suspending the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days. China was the only exception, being hit with a hefty 145% tariff. Then, late Friday, the Trump administration announced what seemed like a tariff exemption for electronic items and semiconductors imported from China. However \u2014 as with so much of the craziness surrounding Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 that didn\u2019t last long. In a Sunday post on Truth Social , the president clarified that no country is getting \u201coff the hook\u201d for its unfair trade practices. More importantly, he said his administration did not provide tariff exemptions Friday. Electronics, TVs, semiconductors and flash drives will continue to face a 20% tariff aimed at punishing countries Trump accuses of exporting the deadly drug fentanyl into the United States. The U.S. government is simply moving these products to a \u201cdifferent Tariff \u2018bucket,'\u201d Trump wrote. Providing further clarification, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the government provided certain electronics items with only temporary exemptions. These items will become subject to \u201csemiconductor tariffs\u201d set to take effect within a month or two. \u201cAll those products are going to come under semiconductors, and they\u2019re going to have a special focus type of tariff to make sure that those products get reshored,\u201d Lutnick said Sunday on ABC News show This Week. \u201cWe need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels \u2014 we need to have these things made in America. We can\u2019t be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us.\u201d Apple devices are safe from tariffs \u2026 for now For now, iPhones, Macs and other electronic devices remain safe from the 10% global tariffs implemented by Trump. However, this will change in the future as the U.S. government decides on a \u201cspecial focus\u201d tariff for semiconductors. Apple reportedly stockpiled iPhones before implementation of the proposed tariffs , which would have gone into effect last week. It could do the same over the next one or two months as the Trump administration finalizes its new semiconductor tariff.

By Hadlee Simons \u2022 Published on April 14, 2025 \u2022 0 \u2022 Lanh Nguyen / Android Authority TL;DR Apple\u2019s foldable iPhone will apparently have an under-display camera on the folding screen. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold devices have offered this feature since 2021. This camera is nearly invisible but has noticeably inferior image quality compared to a conventional selfie camera. Apple is widely tipped to launch its first foldable iPhone next year, and we\u2019ve already seen a few rumors about this device. Now, it sounds like this new foldable phone could adopt a rather interesting camera borrowed from Samsung. Frequent tipster Digital Chat Station has claimed on Weibo that Apple\u2019s upcoming foldable phone will feature an under-display selfie camera on the folding screen. Meanwhile, the cover display is said to have a camera in a cutout. Weibo/Digital Chat Station In other words, Apple would be copying Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold devices by adopting an under-display selfie camera for the folding display. 2021\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold 3 was the first foldable with this camera and last year\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold 6 maintained this feature. Under-display cameras hide under the screen and are nearly invisible, making for a more immersive screen viewing experience. However, these cameras have poor image quality compared to conventional selfie cameras. This is because the display blocks a lot of light from hitting the camera sensor. So you really shouldn\u2019t expect this camera to take great photos on Apple\u2019s foldable. For what it\u2019s worth, we thought the under-display shooter on the Z Fold 6 was only good for video calls and that the cover display camera was better. Digital Chat Station reiterated that the foldable iPhone will have a 7.76-inch folding screen and a 5.49-inch cover display. However, they also revealed that the folding screen would have a 2,713 x 1,920 resolution while the cover display is poised to have a 2,088 x 1,422 resolution. Either way, it sounds like Apple is adopting a squat form factor like the original Pixel Fold and OPPO Find N2 rather than the tall and narrow form factor adopted by Samsung. Got a tip? Talk to us!

This report looks at the different procurement methods companies can use when adopting renewable energy. Over 400 of the world's largest companies have committed to transition fully to renewable electricity, with 278 of these aiming to achieve their target on or before 2030. There are multiple ways companies can buy renewable energy. Each comes with its own challenges, and some can leave corporate buyers open to accusations of greenwashing. Key Highlights On-site generation is the most robust procurement method but has extremely high upfront costs. On-site generation refers to producing energy at the site where it will be consumed. This is an expensive procurement method, as it has high upfront and maintenance costs, but it guarantees 100% renewable energy (RE100) for a company's facilities. This method is best suited for companies with a low number of facilities or large corporations with the capital to invest in new power plants. Power purchase agreements (PPAs) are becoming more popular. PPAs are long-term contracts between a clean electricity generator and a customer. PPAs may last up to 25 years, during which time the buyer purchases energy at a pre-negotiated price. High credit requirements make PPAs most appropriate for companies that can guarantee continuous energy demand over a long period of time. Supply contracts are the more suitable option for smaller enterprises without the opportunity for on-site generation. This report analyzes renewable energy procurement methods, including on-site renewable generation, power purchase agreements (PPAs), supply contracts, and energy attribute certificates (EACs).It also evaluates the main challenges to renewable energy procurement, including oversupply, price pressures, and skyrocketing demand. Understand why companies need to adopt renewable energy. Access the different methods of renewable energy procurement. Identify which energy procurement method is most appropriate for your company.

Upon arrival at a selected petrol station, the car automatically detects it. The driver can then enter the pump number and verify the gasoline station by launching the app on the car's screen.

Washington, United States: Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. Defining the market A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

Home News You are here The one to take on the Galaxy S26 and iPhone 18 will probably pack a 7,000 mAh battery By Sebastian Pier Published: Apr 14, 2025, 3:09 AM 0 comments Follow us on Google News Samsung Apple Xiaomi Galaxy S Series iPhone Up Next: The Galaxy S25 and the Apple iPhone 16 Pro for reference. | Image credit \u2013 PhoneArena Come 2026, the phone industry will meet the Galaxy S26 and the iPhone 18 \u2013 unless both Samsung and Apple go with different monikers \u2013 and these two flagships will have to deal with a phone that could arrive with a mind-boggling battery. It's the Xiaomi 16 that is rumored to pack a 7,000 mAh battery next year, when it materializes. The popular Weibo (a large Chinese social media platform) tipster by the nickname of Smart Pikachu is the one who predicts it: Image source \u2013 Weibo In these current times of ours, rumors about a phone with such a massive battery is certainly not that much of a surprise. After all, Honor might be unveiling a handset with a massive 8,000 mAh capacity cell under the hood. We're now entering Android's Big Battery Era , as my colleague Alan underscored the other day. Some tipsters say Android flagships from the recent future could reach battery capacities of up to 7,500 mAh. The Red Magic 10 Pro, for example, already features a 7,050 mAh battery, and rumors suggest the OnePlus 14 may come with a 7000 mAh battery (the OnePlus 13 has a 6,000 mAh cell). Receive the latest Samsung news Subscribe By subscribing you agree to our terms and conditions and privacy policy . What's notable about the possibility of the Xiaomi 16 to pack a 7,000 mAh battery is that the phone could be \"compact\", at least in the flagship category\u2026 and if Xiaomi keeps the dimensions of the Xiaomi 15 , a 6.36-inch phone. Battery technology advancements are super cool: it's not just owners of tile-sized phones that can enjoy superb battery life. Those among us who cherish compact devices will not be left behind, and this is the kind of news that gives a nice start to the week. Xiaomi 16 is still too ahead in time to be discussed in detail, but we're about to meet another compact flagship with a massive battery real soon: the OnePlus 13T. This flagship killer is expected to launch with a 6,200 mAh battery (for reference, the Galaxy S25 Ultra packs a 5,000 mAh capacity cell) and the maxed-out Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. It's also rumored to be under 189 grams, thanks to its \"Glacier battery\", developed with battery giant CATL a year ago. Designed to stay cool under pressure, the cell technology helps improve both battery life and performance. Compact phones often overheat during gaming while charging, leading to a poor experience, so keeping the battery cool is crucial. Did you enjoy reading this article?

However, it seems that there is a slight twist, and the tax relief will only be short-lived. According to the Trump administration, the 125 percent reciprocal tariff relief is only temporary, and the taxes will continue to be applied to smartphones, laptops, and more in the coming \"month or two.\" Apple's exemption from the 'reciprocal' tariff is only temporary, as the Trump administration will announce a new solution in a month or two We have previously reported that US Customs and Border Protection published exclusions from the list of imports that are bound to follow Trump's new 125 percent reciprocal tariff on China along with the base 10 percent global tariff. As mentioned, the exclusions revolved around \u201csmartphones, laptop computers, hard drives, computer processors, and memory chips.\u201d Related Story Apple Takes Global Smartphone Crown In Q1 For The First Time, Thanks To iPhone 16e\u2019s Affordable Price And Mass Appeal That Helped It Outsell Every Other Brand Apple would have adhered to a total tariff of 145 percent, which includes the 125 percent reciprocal tax and 20 percent fentanyl tax, which President Trump emphasized in a post on Truth Social today. Currently, it is capped at 20 percent, and based on the information, the relaxation is temporary as the exemption from the reciprocal tariff is not a \"permanent sort of exemption,\" according to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik. Lutnik stated in an interview with ABC News that the tech sector would receive a \"special focus type of tariff \" (via The Verge ), emphasizing that the social tariff would include products like the iPhone. President Donald Trump's remarks on Truth Social were quite similar, as he also claimed that the administration would take a closer look at semiconductors and the \"whole electronics supply chain\" in the forthcoming tariff investigation. We can safely presume that the Trump administration would announce a special tax for the tech industry at a later date, possibly in a month or two, as per the officials. The tariff could be less than the current 125 percent reciprocal tax but could be higher than it was before. For Apple, it means that reliance on China for components and semiconductors would no longer be a long-term solution, as it would seek imports from India and Vietnam. The company could also ramp up its investments in the regions and compel its suppliers to do the same as well. Currently, Apple does manufacture its products in Vietnam, which includes the new M4 MacBook Air and M3 Ultra Mac Studio, but the supply is quite limited compared to China's vast manufacturing facilities. We will keep you posted on the latest, so do stick around for more details.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed that smartphones, computer monitors, and various electronic components are among the exempted items. This means Apple has dodged another bullet \u2014 again. This news is clearly good for Apple and for us as customers in the short term. However, it\u2019s also a flashing red warning for the future. Apple currently assembles over 90% of its iPhones in China. That represents an enormous concentration of risk in one country. That\u2019s too much for any company, and certainly too much for a company shipping hundreds of millions of devices annually to customers worldwide. I fully acknowledge that moving iPhone manufacturing out of China isn\u2019t as simple as flipping a switch. Apple has spent decades meticulously building that supply chain, a masterpiece of logistics and precision manufacturing. But global trade dynamics are evolving rapidly, and Apple can\u2019t afford to stand still. This isn\u2019t about politics; it\u2019s about resilience. Apple has executed Herculean efforts before. Now is another moment when they must rise to the occasion. Diversifying their manufacturing base might be the single most critical long-term move they can make right now. (That sentence was difficult to write because I also believe they need to fix their Siri/AI issues.

The PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201c How People Pay: Budgeting Anxiety Drives Debit Card Usage \u201d shed light on the nuanced decision making behind payment method selection in brick-and-mortar stores and across digital channels. The report, a comprehensive survey of 2,552 U.S. consumers conducted in August, uncovered a fundamental tension between consumers seeking to manage their spending and those prioritizing financial incentives. This dichotomy played out differently depending on the shopping environment. For in-store purchases, debit cards and cash were favored by those focused on budgeting and convenience, with 14% of debit card users and 20% of cash users citing budget management as a key reason for their choice. Conversely, credit card use in-store was predominantly driven by the desire for rewards or cash back, cited by 40% of users. Security concerns also factored into in-store choices, with cash being the preferred method for consumers prioritizing payment security. The online landscape presented a slightly different picture, although the underlying themes of budgeting and incentives persisted. Budget-minded online shoppers gravitated toward debit cards, with roughly a quarter highlighting the ease of tracking payments and 14% emphasizing budget control. Security became a more prominent factor in online transactions, with 8.3% of credit card users citing better security compared to 4.8% of debit card users. Despite this, the primary driver for online credit card use remained rewards, attracting one-third of users. Digital wallets emerged as a strong contender for online convenience, with 55% of users citing them as their main reason, higher than debit or credit cards. Trust in the provider played a larger role for PayPal users compared to those using Google Pay or Apple Pay . Other key findings from the report: Forty percent of consumers using credit cards in-store were motivated by rewards or cash back. This highlighted the continued power of incentive programs in driving credit card adoption for physical purchases. Convenience was the top motivator for online debit card use, cited by 44% of users. This underscored the importance of seamless transaction experiences in the digital realm for debit card holders. Fifty-five percent of online digital wallet users prioritized convenience. This demonstrated the growing appeal of digital wallets for their ease and efficiency in eCommerce . Beyond these key takeaways, the report delved into other compelling aspects of consumer payment behavior. For instance, it explored the motivations behind digital wallet use in physical stores, where convenience was also the leading factor, albeit by a smaller margin compared to online transactions. The report also differentiated between various digital wallet providers, noting the importance of brand trust for PayPal users.

By learning how to optimize these features, you can maximize your device\u2019s efficiency, extend its lifespan, and ensure a smoother user experience. In the video below, iReviews explores ten common mistakes and provides actionable tips to help you make the most of your iPhone. Watch this video on YouTube . 1. Misusing the App Switcher Many users believe that frequently closing apps in the app switcher conserves battery life, but this practice can have the opposite effect. When you force-close an app, your iPhone must reload it entirely the next time you open it, consuming more energy and system resources. Instead, allow iOS to manage background apps automatically\u2014it is designed to optimize memory and battery usage efficiently. Trusting the system to handle this process can improve your device\u2019s overall performance and reduce unnecessary strain. 2. Overusing Wireless Charging Wireless charging offers unparalleled convenience, but excessive reliance on it can lead to overheating, which gradually degrades your iPhone\u2019s battery health. To mitigate this, alternate between wireless and wired charging methods. Additionally, ensure your wireless charging pad is certified and placed in a well-ventilated area to prevent heat buildup. By taking these precautions, you can maintain your battery\u2019s longevity and avoid unnecessary wear. 3. Allowing Heat Exposure Heat is one of the most significant threats to your iPhone\u2019s internal components. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures\u2014such as leaving your device in direct sunlight or using bulky cases during intensive tasks like gaming or charging\u2014can cause permanent damage. If your iPhone feels hot, remove the case and allow it to cool naturally. Avoid placing your device in environments prone to extreme heat, such as car dashboards or outdoor surfaces, to protect its hardware and performance. 4. Mismanaging Location Services Location services are essential for apps like navigation and weather, but leaving them enabled for all apps can drain your battery and compromise your privacy. To optimize this feature, navigate to Settings > Privacy > Location Services and enable it only for apps that genuinely require it. Whenever possible, select the \u201cWhile Using the App\u201d option to limit unnecessary tracking. This simple adjustment can significantly improve battery life and enhance your privacy. 5. Ignoring Auto-Lock Settings Failing to configure the auto-lock feature can lead to unnecessary battery drain and increase the risk of unauthorized access to your device. To safeguard your iPhone, set it to lock automatically after a short period of inactivity. Go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock and choose a one- or two-minute interval. This setting not only conserves energy but also enhances the security of your personal data. 6. Leaving AirDrop Always On AirDrop is a convenient tool for sharing files, but keeping it enabled at all times can drain your battery and expose your device to potential security vulnerabilities. When not in use, disable AirDrop by swiping down to access the Control Center, tapping AirDrop, and selecting \u201cReceiving Off.\u201d Enable it only when you need to transfer files. This small habit can improve battery efficiency and reduce the risk of unauthorized file sharing. 7. Using Cellular Data Instead of Wi-Fi Relying on cellular data instead of Wi-Fi consumes significantly more battery power. Whenever possible, connect to a secure Wi-Fi network to reduce energy usage and improve connection stability. Additionally, you can disable cellular data for apps that don\u2019t require it by going to Settings > Cellular and toggling off unnecessary apps. This not only conserves battery life but also helps you manage your data usage more effectively. 8. Overloading iCloud Storage iCloud is a powerful tool for syncing and backing up data, but allowing too many apps to access it can result in excessive background activity and storage issues. To manage this, go to Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud and review which apps have access. Disable iCloud syncing for apps that don\u2019t need it to free up storage space and reduce unnecessary activity. This ensures your iPhone operates more efficiently while keeping your cloud storage organized. 9. Skipping Software Updates Outdated software can leave your iPhone vulnerable to bugs, glitches, and security threats. Regular updates not only fix these issues but also introduce new features and performance improvements. To streamline this process, enable automatic updates by going to Settings > General > Software Update > Automatic Updates. Keeping your device up-to-date ensures it remains secure and operates at peak efficiency without requiring constant manual intervention. 10. Neglecting Regular Reboots Restarting your iPhone periodically can refresh system processes, resolve minor glitches, and enhance overall performance. This simple habit ensures smoother operation and helps your device run more efficiently. To reboot your iPhone, press and hold the power button, then follow the on-screen instructions. Incorporating this practice into your routine can prevent small issues from escalating and keep your device running optimally. By addressing these common mistakes, you can significantly improve your iPhone\u2019s performance, battery life, and security. Small adjustments\u2014such as managing location services, alternating charging methods, and rebooting regularly\u2014can make a noticeable difference in how efficiently your device operates. Take control of your iPhone\u2019s features today to enjoy a more reliable and seamless user experience.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Zak Doffman writes about security, surveillance and privacy. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 03:54am EDT Share Save Comment All change for Gmail. NurPhoto via Getty Images Interesting times for Gmail. Google has confirmed that its two new headline upgrades don\u2019t actually work together, raising awkward questions for its 3 billion users. And so all those users now must grapple with a new upgrade decision, one with major implications for the future direction of the platform and for what Google does next. We\u2019re talking AI, security and privacy. The two upgrades that clash are a kind of quasi end-to-end encryption and an AI-fueled search alternative that promises a markedly different quality of results. Unfortunately, Google can\u2019t see your fully encrypted emails (rightly so), and must exclude those emails from its AI search results. This will not be a one-off situation. Cloud-based AI features and device-based security do not work well together, leaving users with some tough decisions to make. Apple had seemed to resolve this with its Private Cloud Compute, but then its disastrous Apple Intelligence delays made all that somewhat academic for the time being at least. Forbes Google\u2019s Messages Update Just Made Android More Like iPhone By Zak Doffman Newsweek has now neatly framed the decision facing Gmail users: \u201cAllow Gmail to use AI-driven tools by enabling \u2018smart features\u2019 and data sharing, [or] MORE FOR YOU Netflix\u2019s Best New Show Nabs A Perfect 100% Critic Score Fed Official Confirms Trump Tariff Bailout Is Ready Amid $30 Trillion Market \u2018Panic\u2019 Warning Gmail And Microsoft 2FA Security Bypass \u2014 Take Action Now, Users Told decline the use of AI tools, which limits certain features but offers stronger data privacy.\u201d But this isn\u2019t a simple yes or no. Gmail and other email platforms are driving towards an AI future and it won\u2019t be that easy to disable all the AI settings. Remember, Google has access to all your content anyway in its cloud servers. The only real opt-out (bar changing a bunch of admin settings) is to fully secure your emails. And on that, the caveats and qualifiers around Gmail\u2019s end-to-end encryption highlight how difficult a medium email is to fully secure. Even with Advanced Data Protection enabled, Apple Mail is one of the only exceptions to what can be end-to-end encrypted on iPhone. As Apple explains, \u201ciCloud Mail does not use end-to-end encryption because of the need to interoperate with the global email system,\u201d albeit \u201call native Apple email clients support optional S/MIME for message encryption.\u201d Beyond email, this new AI decision is not specific to Gmail. You will see variations from multiple other platforms in the coming months. WhatsApp\u2019s new Advanced Chat Privacy stops users exporting entire chats or saving media to their phone gallery \u2014 easily bypassed of course, but also stops engagement with Meta AI within a chat. Ask yourself why. Again, new AI updates and security and privacy don\u2019t work well together. Forbes U.S. iPhone, Android Users At Risk From New Chinese Attacks By Zak Doffman Meanwhile, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT \u201c will now remember your old conversations ,\u201d which sounds great until you consider the privacy implications of all that personal data being stored in a readily accessible way. In all likelihood nothing has changed from a data standpoint, except the optics. But even as Sam Altman posted his excitement at \u201cAI systems that get to know you over your life, and become extremely useful and personalized,\u201d the move unsurprisingly \u201c sparked privacy concerns .\u201d Users can choose to opt out of ChatGPT\u2019s update, but just as with Gmail, there is no sensible level of user education and understanding. What are the risks and trade-offs? What happens to your data and how is it secured and safeguarded? Is there even a common syntax to explain this choice across platforms? Specifically on Gmail \u2014 yes, you must decide whether you want AI marauding across your data, but you also need to be clear on the pros and cons of email itself. It\u2019s not a fully secure platform and is open to malware, phishing and spam. All of that will also get worse as the trickle of AI attacks becomes a tidal wave. In reality, there\u2019s a much larger rethink required. My recommendation is to keep all that in mind as you decide. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

The US President, 78, has put tariffs up to 145 percent on Chinese goods whilst announcing a 90-day tariff pause for most other countries. This includes a 10 percent baseline on most imports. And then just last week (11 April), the US Customs and Border Protection looked to have revealed a long list of tech products that would be exempt from tariffs. This included products like smartphones, laptops and TVs. Advert Tariff exemptions would have been welcomed by tech firms, such as Apple , who rely on China to manufacture a reported 80 percent of its products and 90 percent of their iPhones . When talking to ABC News, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said such exemptions would only be temporary as they would be part of the tariffs yet to come 'in a month or two'. However, Trump insisted last night (13 April) that 'nobody is getting off the hook' with tariff exemptions. Taking to his social media platform, Truth Social, he wrote in a lengthy post that 'NOBODY is getting 'off the hook' for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!' Advert He explained that 'there was no tariff exception announced on Friday', as the products were 'just moving to a different Tariff bucket'. \"The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it,\" Trump added. \"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. Donald Trump insisted that 'nobody is getting off the hook' with tariff exemptions (MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) \"What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. Advert \"We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER!\" The businessman promised to provide 'more and better paying jobs, making products in our nation, and treating other countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us.' This comes after Trump was asked in a press conference if he would consider putting the tariffs up if a deal wasn't met with other countries. Trump has issued somewhat of a u-turn (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images) \"Well, that's what would happen,\" he said. \"I mean, if we can't make the deal that we want to make or we have to make or that's good for both parties - and it's got to be good for both parties - then we go back to where we were. Advert \"We'll have to see what happens at that time.\" Meanwhile, China has raised tariffs on US goods to 125 percent after Chinese president Xi Jinping warned that 'there are no winners in a tariff war'. During a recent broadcast, he said: \u201cFor more than 70 years, China has always relied on itself and hard work for development, never relying on favours from anyone, and not fearing any unreasonable suppression.\u201d Featured Image Credit: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Topics: Politics , Donald Trump Anish Vij Anish is a Journalist at LADbible Group and is a GG2 Young Journalist of the Year 2025.

They have carefully enriched the digital experience, contributing to multi-billion dollar success. Thousands of banks and Fintechs try to tap into the same principles. In this article, we\u2019ll uncover 13 iconic UX innovations from the world\u2019s top tech giants\u2014and show you exactly how to adapt these brilliant insights for financial services. Because if a single tap can revolutionize e-commerce, just think what it could do for your financial brand. Let\u2019s dive in. Of course, the rise of AI is transforming the world and the way we interact with digital services, making its integration into future banking solutions all but inevitable. Yet, many banks and financial institutions still haven\u2019t adopted the very digital innovations that have already proven their worth in the world\u2019s largest tech companies. You will likely recognize the 13 user experience (UX) innovations featured in this article; most of us use them daily. These innovations were central to the success of multi-billion-dollar tech corporations\u2014yet they\u2019re surprisingly underutilized in financial services. How can banks and Fintechs leverage these proven UX strategies to transform generic copycut products into unique experiences that increase user engagement, build trust and increase key business metrics? Historically, the banking industry has struggled with a reputation for complexity and formality. However, today\u2019s consumers expect the same frictionless and rich experiences they enjoy in e-commerce and digital entertainment. Advanced banks and Fintechs are discovering that even small design tweaks can translate into major gains in customer satisfaction and revenue. Applying 13 Iconic UX Innovations to Financial Services Below are 13 widely cited examples of interface adjustments\u2014such as refining a single button or streamlining the onboarding process\u2014that drove significant improvements in both business outcomes and user experience. While they may appear modest, these best practices solve pressing user needs and have already become the standard across digital products in multiple industries. At UXDA we refer to this with our \u201cdopamine banking\u201d approach: using UX design to create micro-rewards and positive emotional triggers that keep users engaged, satisfied and returning to digital financial service. The core idea is that seemingly minor updates to enrich user experience can deliver remarkable returns in customer adoption, engagement and gained revenue. Dopamine, frequently called the \u201cfeel-good\u201d neurotransmitter, is released when users perceive rewards or positive outcomes. By aligning UX choices with these reward mechanisms, financial institutions can guide user behavior while raising overall satisfaction. Because these UX techniques have gained amazing results in the world's top digital services, a lack of them can place your product at a competitive disadvantage. Let\u2019s explore how these small but powerful interface design enhancements can generate unexpectedly large benefits for financial services: 1. One-Tap Actions Example: Amazon\u2019s \u201cOne-Click\u201d Checkout Instead of requiring users to fill in shipping and payment details repeatedly, Amazon introduced a single-click purchase flow once the user\u2019s information was saved. Drastically reduced cart abandonment by removing friction. Demonstrated how investing in a single, streamlined flow could transform the entire experience. \u201cOne-Click\u201d became one of Amazon\u2019s competitive advantages, credited with boosting conversion and recurring orders. Why It Matters: Eliminates friction: Streamlined workflows for common banking transactions (e.g., paying bills or sending peer-to-peer transfers) reduce dropout rates. Boosts engagement: Customers who see banking as fast and convenient are more likely to open and use the app frequently. Creates loyalty: By removing repetitive tasks, banks can delight users with near-instant, secure transactions. Implementation Tips: After user identity verification (via Face ID or a PIN), provide a single-button action: \u201cPay This Bill\u201d or \u201cSend $50 to John.\u201d Offer a short confirmation step for high-value transactions to reassure users. Dopamine Trigger: Instant Gratification: When users pay a bill or send money with a single tap, they receive immediate feedback (\u201cPayment successful!\u201d), which provides a quick sense of accomplishment. That momentary success can release dopamine as the brain recognizes a goal was achieved with minimal effort. Reduced Friction: Fewer steps mean fewer opportunities for friction, which can dampen positive emotion. The simpler the flow, the clearer the reward path. Emotional Effect: Users feel empowered and in control because they accomplished a meaningful task (paying a bill, making a transfer) with little friction. This positive emotional signal can reinforce future usage. 2. Minimalist First Screen Example: Google Search\u2019s Simplified Homepage From the earliest days, Google maintained a minimalist homepage, focusing on a single search bar and little else. Over the years, they\u2019ve retained that simplicity, carefully avoiding clutter. The clean, simple interface helped users find what they needed faster, becoming a hallmark of Google\u2019s brand. Lightning-quick load times enhanced user satisfaction, keeping Google as the world\u2019s leading search engine. This design choice arguably paved the way for \u201cless is more\u201d in modern UI design. Why It Matters: Reduces cognitive load: Users can find critical information (e.g., balances, upcoming payments) at a glance. Improves speed and learning curve: A clean screen with fewer elements typically loads faster, which boosts app performance ratings and is more intuitive for newcomers. Enhances brand clarity: Simple design conveys confidence and modernity, often associated with trust and authority. Implementation Tips: Make the landing screen highly focused: show only key balances, upcoming payments and a primary action (e.g., \u201cSend Money\u201d or \u201cPay Bill\u201d). Hide or tuck away secondary features, ensuring the main page remains uncluttered. Dopamine Trigger: Visual Clarity and Calm: Overly cluttered dashboards can trigger anxiety and reduce attention, blocking the potential release of dopamine associated with navigating something clear and intuitive. Sense of Mastery: A minimalist dashboard that focuses on top tasks gives users a sense that they know exactly where to go\u2014mastery itself can be rewarding and can produce small dopamine hits. Emotional Effect: Users feel relieved and confident rather than overwhelmed. This sense of calm clarity helps them trust the app, making them more open to exploring other features. 3. Personalized Suggestions Example: Netflix\u2019s Seamless Auto-Play and Personalization Netflix introduced auto-play of previews and next episodes, along with a dynamic UI that personalizes title images and recommendations for each viewer. Substantially increased viewer engagement and watch time by reducing friction (no more manual browsing). Encouraged binge-watching behaviors, driving up retention and subscription renewals. Reinforced Netflix\u2019s image as a data-driven, user-centered streaming platform. Why It Matters: Creates relevant user journeys: Contextual nudges like \u201cYou could save $X by refinancing\u201d or \u201cTry our new savings plan\u201d resonate more when tailored to the user\u2019s financial profile. Increases product uptake: Users are more inclined to explore new features or products when prompted with concrete, personalized benefits. Builds advisory value: Over time, customers see the bank as a trusted advisor rather than a mere transaction processor. Implementation Tips: Provide contextual offers: \u201cBased on your spending behavior, you could save $X per month if you\u2026\u201d or \u201cYou have $Y available in savings\u2014would you like to explore investing?\u201d Use spending patterns or deposit trends to offer personalized suggestions. Employ simple infographics or progress bars to explain how each recommendation can benefit the user. Dopamine Trigger: Personal Relevance and Novelty: Unexpected or relevant suggestions (\u201cYou can earn 2% more interest!\u201d) provide a pleasant surprise, stimulating dopamine through novelty and perceived reward potential. Timely Interventions: Well-timed prompts (e.g., \u201cYou have $300 left this month\u2014why not set aside $50 in savings?\u201d) give the user a sense of immediate reward for taking a beneficial action. Emotional Effect: Users feel cared for by the bank, experiencing positive emotions from receiving relevant, seemingly tailor-made tips or deals. The bank shifts from a faceless institution to a helpful advisor. 4. High-Quality Visuals Example: Airbnb\u2019s Emphasis on High-Quality Photos Early on, Airbnb discovered that better photos drove more bookings. They made photo quality a prominent part of their listing creation and updated the platform UI to feature large, appealing images. Listings with professional photos earned more views and significantly higher booking rates. Simplified the user journey: travelers could more easily judge the property, which boosted trust and conversions. This visual-first approach became a core design principle for Airbnb, helping them scale globally. Why It Matters: Conveys professionalism: Clean, high-resolution images, intuitive icons and well-structured graphs reinforce the bank\u2019s credibility. Enhances feature adoption: Users are more likely to try budgeting tools, investment products or robo-advisory solutions if the interfaces look polished and easy to understand. Humanizes the brand: Featuring real customer support avatars or representative photos can reassure users that people are behind the scenes. Implementation Tips: Make all your service interfaces aesthetically pleasing, modern and consistently authentic to your brand identity. Replace generic stock images and icons with consistent, authentic illustrations and icons that reflect your brand identity. Ensure all charts and dashboards use clear color coding and labeling for quick comprehension. Use clear, confidence-inspiring illustrations and real images of your representatives or customer support teams. Provide visual dashboards for spending, savings goals or investment performance to reinforce transparency. Dopamine Trigger: Aesthetic Pleasure: Attractive, cohesive visuals can spark aesthetic appreciation, a subtle dopamine release when encountering good design. Emotional Safety: Seeing modern, clean dashboards and friendly illustrations can reduce stress and create a welcoming environment, making it easier for users to feel a small emotional \u201clift.\u201d Emotional Effect: Users experience greater trust and comfort, which is critical in finance. This emotional security can heighten positive user experiences and keep them coming back. 5. Streamlined Onboarding Example: Basecamp\u2019s Simplified Signup Flow The team behind Basecamp is famous for minimalist designs. One change they cite repeatedly is removing unnecessary fields in the signup process and clarifying each step of the workflow. Lowered the barrier to entry, leading to a jump in completed signups. Reinforced the brand\u2019s commitment to frictionless user experiences. Provided a template for many SaaS products that copied the \u201cless friction, more clarity\u201d signup ethos. Why It Matters: Shortens time to value: The faster users can open an account or apply for a loan, the sooner they\u2019ll start engaging with your services. Reduces abandonment: Fewer forms and clearer step-by-step instructions mean less friction and dropout. Enhances perception of modernity: Smooth digital onboarding sets your bank apart from clunky, time-consuming competitors. Implementation Tips: Use progressive forms: show only what\u2019s needed at each step (e.g., personal info, then ID verification, then income details). Integrate real-time validation to catch errors on the spot (e.g., incorrect ID format). Remove extraneous fields or combine them smartly. Dopamine Trigger: Progress Feedback and Small Wins: Breaking down account creation into manageable steps (with real-time feedback) gives the user multiple mini \u201cwins,\u201d each capable of sparking a dopamine release. Reduced Anxiety: A simpler process means less cognitive load, so users can be more receptive to the small emotional highs of completion. Emotional Effect: Users feel accomplished at each step instead of stressed or frustrated. This sense of steady progress encourages them to finish onboarding and remain engaged afterward. 6. Referral Prompts Example: Dropbox\u2019s \u201cGet Space\u201d Referral Prompt Dropbox made a small tweak to highlight their referral program\u2014offering extra storage if you invite friends\u2014more prominently within the app UI. Skyrocketed referral-driven account signups, becoming a core viral loop for Dropbox\u2019s early growth. Simple, unobtrusive calls to action resulted in widespread brand advocacy at a very low cost. Became a legendary example of how product-led growth can hinge on a few well-placed nudges. Why It Matters: Accelerates user acquisition: Referral programs encourage organic word-of-mouth expansion with minimal marketing spend. Increases loyalty: Existing customers get a \u201cwin\u201d when they successfully refer friends or family. Validates trust: People are more likely to trust a bank recommended by someone they know, which can amplify your brand\u2019s reputation. Implementation Tips: Make sharing easy: a simple banner or button in the app that lets users send a unique referral link or code. Offer tangible incentives like cash rewards, waived fees or bonus interest for both parties. Offer a simple in-app invite (\u201cRefer a friend to open a checking account and you both get $XX\u201d). Make the referral prompt a friendly, unobtrusive banner on the homepage or in user settings. Dopamine Trigger: Social Validation and Reward: Getting a bonus for referring a friend\u2014and knowing the friend also benefits\u2014creates a win-win scenario that triggers dopamine both through social approval and the tangible reward (like cash or bonus points). Positive Anticipation: Waiting to see if the referral converts is itself a mini thrill, and receiving the reward spikes dopamine upon success. Emotional Effect: Users feel valued by the bank and take pride in sharing a good product with friends. The reward structure cements loyalty and fosters a community feeling. 7. Progress Bar Example: LinkedIn\u2019s Progress Bar for Profile Completion Adding a visual progress bar and step-by-step guidance encouraged users to complete their profiles or any other applications. More complete profiles led to better matches and increased recruiter engagement and user satisfaction. Significantly boosted LinkedIn\u2019s key metric: time spent on the platform and networking success. Set a precedent for gamified \u201conboarding journeys\u201d now found in countless apps and services. Why It Matters: Encourages thorough KYC: Seeing a profile progress bar can nudge users to verify their address, upload identification or add income details. Improves overall service: A fully updated profile unlocks faster loan decisions, personalized advice and lower compliance risk. Adds a gamification element: Users experience a sense of reward when reaching 100% completion, increasing the likelihood they\u2019ll continue exploring the app. Implementation Tips: Introduce a visual tracker that shows how much of the user\u2019s profile is complete (e.g., address, ID documents, phone verification, etc.). Provide incentives: \u201cComplete your profile to unlock faster loan approvals or instant transfers.\u201d Show clear benefits at each milestone: \u201cAdd your employer to boost credit limit possibilities.\u201d Use celebratory micro-animations or badges when users reach a new completion level. Dopamine Trigger: Gamification and Achievement: Each incremental fill in the progress bar is a mini-achievement, which can consistently trigger small amounts of dopamine as the user edges closer to 100%. Clear Goals and Feedback: The brain loves clear goals with visible feedback loops\u2014hitting them translates into tangible reward signals. Emotional Effect: Users feel rewarded and motivated to complete their profile (or KYC steps), associating the banking app with a sense of accomplishment rather than dread. 8. One-Tap Feedback Example: Facebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d Button (and Reactions) Initially, adding the simple \u201cLike\u201d button offered a low-effort way to acknowledge posts. Later, other reactions (e.g., love, angry, sad, etc.) were introduced for more nuanced engagement. \u201cLikes\u201d quickly became a core social metric, encouraging users to engage with content. Reactions gave Facebook deeper data on user preferences and emotional responses. The small tweak of going from zero to multiple \u201creactions\u201d changed the way users share feedback, spurring increased interaction. Why It Matters: Ensures continuous improvement: Quick feedback loop helps the bank measure customer satisfaction on-the-go \u201cthumbs up or down\u201d or a 1\u20135 star rating. Customer-centered culture: Creates a culture of continuous improvement, powered by data-driven insights on customer satisfaction. Builds customer trust: Users see the bank is genuinely interested in their experience, not just the transaction. Implementation Tips: After a chat or call with customer support, show a one-tap feedback mechanism (like a thumbs up or 1\u20135 stars). Provide optional expanded reactions for more nuanced feedback (e.g., \u201cfast response,\u201d \u201cfriendly agent,\u201d \u201cissue not resolved\u201d). Instant experience rate request with optional fields for more details: \u201cPlease tell us why\u201d if the user gives a low rating. Sum up feedback in dashboards to identify trends and training opportunities. Dopamine Trigger: Instant Sense of Contribution: Providing a quick reaction or rating triggers a small psychological reward, as the user feels \u201cheard\u201d by the service. Social Mechanism: Positive feedback loops\u2014like a quick \u201cthumbs up\u201d for a helpful chat\u2014mirror social media\u2019s reaction mechanisms, each delivering micro doses of dopamine for both the user and the service agent (if they see high ratings). Emotional Effect: Users feel empowered and believe their feedback matters, building a stronger emotional connection and sense of loyalty to the institution. 9. Biometric One-Tap Payment Example: Apple iPhone\u2019s \u201cApple Pay\u201d One-Tap Checkout Apple seamlessly integrated \u201cApple Pay\u201d into the iPhone\u2019s core experience, allowing users to authorize payments with Face ID or Touch ID in just one tap. Eliminated friction: Removing the need to type credit card details or billing addresses significantly shortened the checkout flow. Boosted adoption: Partnerships with major retailers and apps helped \u201cApple Pay\u201d become a ubiquitous, go-to payment method. Strengthened ecosystem: The convenience factor kept users locked into Apple\u2019s ecosystem, reinforcing brand loyalty. Why It Matters: Frictionless transactions: One-tap or one-look authentication for financial transactions sets a new bar for quick, secure payments in banking apps. Increased user trust: Apple\u2019s strong privacy and security stance assures users that their sensitive data is protected. Future-proofing: As users grow accustomed to instant payments, banks that fail to offer similarly smooth experiences risk losing relevance. Implementation Tips: Biometric integration: Tie into the device\u2019s biometric security (Face ID, Touch ID) to reduce login friction and confirm transactions seamlessly. Enter Apple ecosystem: Present the Add Card to Apple Pay (or equivalent) button prominently in your app. Dopamine Trigger: Instant gratification: The speed and ease of paying with a tap or glance release small hits of dopamine associated with accomplishing tasks effortlessly. Security + convenience rush: Users get the dual reward of feeling both safe and efficient, reinforcing positive emotions. Emotional Effect: The marriage of security and speed makes users feel their bank is modern and protective, increasing emotional loyalty. 10. Recurring Personalized Discovery Example: Spotify\u2019s \u201cDiscover Weekly\u201d Personalized Playlists Spotify pioneered user-specific music recommendations with \u201cDiscover Weekly,\u201d a curated playlist updated each Monday. High engagement: Users often check the playlist regularly, boosting in-app listening time. Built habit loops: The anticipation of new, tailored songs each week fosters a loyal user base. Industry-defining: It became a blueprint for recommendation systems across music and media platforms. Why It Matters: Contextual insights: Banks can similarly offer spending insights or saving tips based on a customer\u2019s \u201cfinancial habits.\u201d Habit formation: Recurring personalized prompts (like monthly spending reviews) can keep users returning to the app. Deep user bonds: Showing you \u201cknow\u201d your customer\u2019s preferences builds trust and longer-term engagement. Implementation Tips: Weekly or monthly insights: Provide automated \u201cFinancial Snapshot\u201d playlists\u2014like recommended budgeting steps or relevant offers Data-driven personalization: Leverage machine learning on user transaction data to highlight products or services with the highest personal benefit. Easy discovery: Place these personalized recommendations front and center on the home screen or via push notifications. Dopamine Trigger: Novelty and surprise: Finding a new favorite song (or, in banking terms, discovering a new benefit) sparks a dopamine hit. Positive reinforcement: When suggestions prove helpful, users feel validated and look forward to more customized tips. Emotional Effect: Users feel recognized on an individual level, forging an emotional link with your brand. 11. Single-Tap Rides Example: Uber\u2019s One-Tap Ride Request Uber simplified ride-hailing to a single tap, automatically detecting location, matching a driver and processing payment in the background. Revolutionized convenience: Removing the need for phone calls, manual address entry or cash changed urban transport globally. Increased retention: Customers repeatedly chose Uber for the seamless experience over traditional cabs or slower competitor apps. Set user expectations: Ride-hailing is now synonymous with \u201ctap, ride, done.\u201d Why It Matters: Reduced friction = higher usage: In finance, simplifying complex tasks (like requesting a loan or splitting bills) can lead to more frequent user activity. Automation of details: Users appreciate not having to re-enter repeated data points, echoing the convenience of \u201cno-cash, no-hassle\u201d rides. Brand differentiation: A bank offering near-instant processes (e.g., quick loan approvals) stands out in a crowded market. Implementation Tips: Auto-fill data: For repeat transactions, pre-fill as many details as possible so users just confirm. Transparent process: Show real-time status updates (e.g., \u201cYour request is being processed,\u201d \u201cApproved in 10 seconds\u201d). Built-in payments: Keep the payment mechanism seamless within the app rather than redirecting to external portals. Dopamine Trigger: Immediate outcome: One-tap actions that instantly produce a tangible result (like calling a ride) reward the brain with a sense of competence. Predictability and control: Knowing exactly when the \u201ccar\u201d or result will arrive fosters calm satisfaction\u2014tiny dopamine bursts. Emotional Effect: Minimizing complexity helps users feel they\u2019re effortlessly in control of their finances, reducing stress. 12. Live Collaboration Canvas Example: Figma\u2019s Real-Time Collaboration Figma introduced live, multi-user editing in a design tool, allowing teams to collaborate in the same file simultaneously. Eliminated version chaos: No more \u201cv2-final-FINAL\u201d file versions. Everyone sees updates instantly. Supercharged productivity: Designers, developers and stakeholders communicate in one place, reducing the number of back-and-forth emails. Community effect: Shared templates and plug-in ecosystems flourished around real-time features, fueling word-of-mouth growth. Why It Matters: Transparent collaboration: In banking apps, real-time co-browsing with support agents or co-managing finances with family members can build trust. Instant updates: Shared budgeting tools or joint account management can show immediate changes, fostering teamwork. Modern user expectations: People now expect seamless, synchronized experiences\u2014bringing that to finance differentiates you from outdated, siloed systems. Implementation Tips: Multi-user features: Offer \u201cjoint account views\u201d in which spouses or business partners see real-time transaction updates and can add notes. Co-browsing support: Enable support reps to view a user\u2019s screen (with permission) to guide them through complex tasks. Notification system: Keep relevant stakeholders in the loop with instant push alerts or in-app updates on shared financial tasks. Dopamine Trigger: Synchronous collaboration joy: Seeing real-time input from others can be exciting and rewarding, sparking mini-dopamine boosts. Reduced friction in teamwork: A frictionless group experience fosters a positive emotional response and a sense of collective achievement. Emotional Effect: Shared ownership and trust provides real-time transparency to build trust among users and between users and the bank. Feeling \u201cin it together\u201d increases satisfaction. 13. Endless Personalized Feed Example: TikTok\u2019s \u201cFor You\u201d Infinite Feed TikTok\u2019s vertical feed quickly personalized videos based on watch time, likes and replays, hooking users into continuous viewing. Hyper-engagement: The algorithm\u2019s accuracy and infinite scroll keep users scrolling far longer than they initially intend. Viral content engine: Easy video creation plus mass distribution turned TikTok into a cultural phenomenon. Redefined short-form media: The \u201cFor You Page\u201d is now the gold standard for endless, highly personalized entertainment. Why It Matters: Contextual curation: Banks can adopt similar \u201cinfinite\u201d but curated feed concepts\u2014like continuously updated financial insights. User stickiness: Engaging, snackable content (short tips, quick budgeting wins) can keep users returning daily. Behavioral data: By analyzing user interactions, the bank can refine future recommendations, from loyalty offers to credit advice. Implementation Tips: Short-form updates: Provide quick, scrollable financial tips or \u201cstories\u201d (e.g., daily spending insights, saving challenges). Personalized content feed: Prioritize recommendations based on each user\u2019s spending patterns, goals and previous interactions. Easy shareability: Let users quickly share these insights or achievements with friends, echoing TikTok\u2019s social \u201cduet\u201d effect. Dopamine Trigger: Endless novelty: Rapid-fire personalized content can trigger repeated dopamine surges as each new \u201ccard\u201d or insight might bring value. Micro-rewards: Even a small, useful tip or motivational nudge can feel rewarding, encouraging continued scrolling. Emotional Effect: Users feel a slight \u201cthrill\u201d in checking what will come up next, building habit loops around financial literacy. Presenting financial guidance in an engaging feed reduces intimidation and builds a positive, exploratory mindset. Final Thoughts While banks and Fintechs must navigate strict regulations and prioritize robust security, interface innovations needn\u2019t be complex to succeed. A single button, a strategic piece of microcopy or a well-placed progress bar can guide user behavior, inspire trust and drive meaningful business results. In a digital world in which consumers can switch providers with a few taps, thoughtful design enhancements are paramount. By adapting proven UX patterns from retail, media and tech to the specialized needs of finance, banks and Fintechs can surprise and delight customers, creating enduring loyalty. Even minor changes\u2014like shortening forms or enabling one-step transactions\u2014can reduce user effort and boost satisfaction. Clear, streamlined interfaces also reassure users that their finances are secure. Psychological nudges, such as progress bars, rewards or urgency indicators, can further influence positive user behavior while distinguishing forward-thinking institutions from those clinging to legacy systems. By weaving small, gratifying user experiences into every step of the banking journey, financial institutions can harness the power of dopamine to boost user satisfaction and build deeper loyalty\u2014all while helping customers manage their finances in a more streamlined, empowering way. Whether it\u2019s removing unnecessary steps, adding a single button or surfacing the right information at the right time, these micro-optimizations often become major growth levers\u2014proving that small, thoughtful design changes can have an outsized impact on both user behavior and business metrics. Minimize friction: Just like in e-commerce or media streaming, faster and simpler interactions increase conversion and satisfaction in banking. Use microcopy and visual cues: Subtle text prompts, progress bars and well-chosen animations reassure users about the seriousness and security of financial actions. Personalization matters: Deliver the right suggestions at the right time\u2014be it a savings prompt or a referral link\u2014to dramatically increase uptake of financial services. Build trust: In finance, trust is paramount. High-quality visuals, clear confirmations and frictionless onboarding reinforce user confidence. Balance and Transparency: Overusing urgency tactics or \u201cdark patterns\u201d can erode trust. Ethical design focuses on helpful nudges rather than manipulative tricks. Sustainable Engagement: Dopamine-driven design should improve financial wellness and user satisfaction, not pushing impulsive actions. Long-Term Loyalty: Positive \u201cmicro-rewards\u201d around money management encourage recurring, long-term usage of your platform.

The goal is to manufacture an apparent public \u201cconsensus\u201d for more migration, according to Lopez: coordinated [PR] content creates a sense of consensus \u2014 giving people a familiar framework to fall back on when forming opinions. Repetition isn\u2019t noise; it\u2019s how narratives take hold. \u2026 A well-informed public that sees immigrants as neighbors, workers, and contributors is essential for democracy itself. A public misled by fear will support mass deportations, surveillance, and state-sponsored cruelty \u2014 especially when they\u2019re presented as the only available options. \u2026 Pro-immigrant forces will succeed if they offer an alternative vision of a modern immigration system centered on citizenship and safety that empowers working families and fuels democracy. The article promoted a free video where a veteran criticized Trump\u2019s pro-American policy, saying, \u201chis immigration polices are immoral \u2026 it goes against all the values that I learned in the military.\u201d \u201cThe real issue isn\u2019t policy; it\u2019s communication,\u201d Lopez said in a March 6 post against national solidarity.\u201dIt\u2019s time to go on offense, flood the zone, and make the case for a country that works for all of us.\u201d In reality, the federal government uses a ruthless economic policy of Extraction Migration to grow Wall Street \u2014 and Powell Jobs\u2019 stock wealth \u2014 by importing more consumers, renters, and workers from developing countries, regardless of the massive pocketbook and civic damage to ordinary Americans and the migrants\u2019 own countries. For example, under President Joe Biden\u2019s high-migration policies, 300 million blue-collar and white-collar Americans lost wealth in the labor and housing markets, and the workplace investment, productivity, and training once enabled by employers. Many college graduates also lost career opportunities as his deputies expanded the inflow of white-collar workers, such as H-1B visa workers . FLASHBACK: 1,500 Migrants Surge Across Border into Texas in Six Hours Citizens also lost civic stability to government-imposed social diversity , and hey l cal power to the expanding blocs of ethnic voters who continue to demand more benefits for their imported communities, cultures, and home countries. Americans have also grown disgusted at their government\u2019s migration policy because it used billions of their dollars to extract human resources from poor countries for use in the U.S. economy- while also causing thousands of deaths among migrants and Americans , plus massive civic damage to the sending countries . Many polls show Americans\u2019 growing opposition to migration amid expensive propaganda from Powell Jobs and other billionaires. In February, Lopez used her CatalyzeUS Substack post to claim that Powell Jobs\u2019 pro-migration message is being overpowered by Trump\u2019s pro-enforcement messages. The best message in the world is useless if no one hears it. Republicans understand this , which is why they aren\u2019t just repeating anti-immigrant lies\u2014they\u2019re saturating every platform, every news cycle, and every medium to ensure no other narrative breaks through. Their propaganda isn\u2019t winning on merit; it\u2019s filling a void left by Democratic silence . While the right floods the airwaves with fearmongering, Democrats act as if polling alone will save them, assuming facts will speak for themselves. But facts don\u2019t win battles\u2014feelings do . Yet her pro-migration side has far more lobbyists on the payroll, more friendly media coverage, and far more elite support. For example, Powell Jobs uses her multi-billion inheritance from Apple founder Steve Jobs to push for more economic migration that transfers ordinary Americans\u2019 wages to wealthy investors. Similarly, billionaire Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Pos t, and its migration coverage almost entirely ignores the economic and civic damage done by American communities by Biden\u2019s illegal and legal migrants, such as H-1B workers. Mark Zuckerberg and a truckload of other billionaires helped created the FWD.us lobbying group, which played a huge role in the Biden administration. After the election, its top officials blamed poor messaging for the public\u2019s reaction to the wealth-shifting inflow of roughly 14 million legal and illegal migrants. \u201cThis election was about rebuking the fact that Biden governed on this issue very poorly, and people did not like what they saw, and they were not hearing a coherent policy or messaging answer on what was coming next,\u201d Andrea Flores, the Vice President of Immigration Policy & Campaigns at FWD.us, said in December. Extraction Migration also does huge damage to migrants, but their suffering is ignored by the establishment media when it cannot be used to sway U.S. politics .

Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. WASHINGTON: Social media juggernaut Meta stands trial on Monday facing serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world's third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \"I'd be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\" As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump's inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \"It would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\" Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook's 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram -- then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram's emergence as \"really scary,\" adding that is \"why we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\" The FTC argues Meta's $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta's defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta's apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta's monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience -- with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. Defining The Market A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta's market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\" a spokesperson said. \"The bigger that Meta can make the relevant market... the more likely it is to defeat the FTC's case,\" said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

By Sankalp Phartiyal, Bloomberg | Updated: 14 April 2025 13:45 IST Photo Credit: Apple iPhones made in India will not attract any duties as of now Highlights The bulk of India-made iPhones are assembled at Foxconn's factory Apple will increasingly prioritise iPhones from India for US Apple now assembles its entire iPhone range in India Advertisement Apple assembled $22 billion (roughly Rs. 1,89,412 crore) worth of iPhones in India in the 12 months ended March, increasing production by nearly 60 percent over the previous year in a sign of continued diversification away from China. The Cupertino, California-headquartered company now makes 20 percent, or one in five, of its prized iPhones in the South Asian country, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified as the information isn't public. The dollar figure represents the devices' estimated factory gate value, rather than the marked-up retail price. The ramp-up suggests the iPhone maker and its suppliers are accelerating a pivot to India from China, a process it began when harsh Covid lockdowns hurt production at Apple's largest plant. The bulk of India-made iPhones are assembled at Foxconn Technology Group's factory in southern India. Tata Group's electronics manufacturing arm, which bought Wistron Corp. and controls Pegatron Corp.'s operations, is also a key supplier. Apple, Nvidia Score Relief From US Tariffs With Exemptions Apple did not respond to a request for comment outside of regular business hours. Of the total India production, Apple exported 1.5 trillion rupees ($17.4 billion) in iPhones from the region in the fiscal year through March 2025, the nation's technology minister said on April 8. Shipments of iPhones from India to the US accelerated after President Donald Trump announced his plans for the so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs in February, the people said. Apple's average India production and exports surged all through the fiscal year to March. Apple Vision Pro 2 Could Be in Development With This Notable Upgrade Apple will increasingly prioritize iPhones from the India supply chain for its US customers, Bloomberg News reported previously. The Trump administration late Friday exempted electronics goods including smartphones and computers from its reciprocal tariffs. That's good news for companies such as Apple and Nvidia , though the reprieve doesn't appear to extend to Trump's separate 20 percent duty on China, applied to pressure Beijing to crack down on fentanyl. This also means iPhones made in India will not attract any duties as of now. Barring the exceptions made Friday, Trump's cumulative levies on China remain at 145 percent and will likely force companies such as Apple to intensify their supply chain shift. But with nearly 200 suppliers and an overwhelming reliance on China, moves to other countries could take years to play out. Despite Trump's ambition to have iPhones made in the US, Apple is unlikely to move production there any time soon due to factors including a shortage of facilities and labor needed to produce the devices. Apple's Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has often praised China's high-level of skill in making its marquee devices. In 2022, Bloomberg Intelligence estimated it would take eight years to move just 10 percent of Apple's production capacity out of China. Apple now assembles its entire iPhone range in India, including the more expensive titanium Pro models . Its manufacturing success in the world's most populous nation is also helped by state subsidies tied to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambition to turn the country into a manufacturing hub. Modi is also seeking to widen electronics component manufacturing with $2.7 billion (roughly Rs. 23,246 crore) in new financial incentives, and is focused on advancing its semiconductor ambitions. Apple has a nearly eight percent market share in India's smartphone market, where its sales \u2014 a bulk of those from iPhones \u2014 reached almost $8 billion (roughly Rs. 68,877 crore) in fiscal 2024. \u00a9 2025 Bloomberg LP (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

By Reuters Updated - April 14, 2025 at 01:15 PM. File photo: A screen displays the Nikkei 225 Stock Average outside a securities firm in Tokyo, Japan. | Photo Credit: Shoko Takayasu Japan's Nikkei share average ended higher on Monday, as iPhone-related shares jumped after the United States excluded smartphones and other electronics from steep tariffs . The Nikkei gained 1.18 per cent to close at 33,982.36, after gaining as much as 2.22 per cent earlier in the session. The broader Topix rose 0.88 per cent to end at 2,488.51. \"The market is still swayed by various headlines,\" said Yugo Tsuboi, chief strategist at Daiwa Securities. \"And none of them are good enough to encourage investors to take their positions confidently.\" U.S. President Donald Trump's administration granted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and some other electronics imported largely from China, providing a big break to tech firms like Apple that rely on imported products. However, both Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said over the weekend these goods will come under separate tariffs, along with semiconductors, that may be imposed in a month or so. Also read Apple India produces $22 billion of iPhones in shift from China Trump had announced hefty reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries on April 2, triggering a market rout, but reversed them with a 90-day freeze shortly after they went into effect. A 10 per cent blanket duty on almost all U.S. imports remains in effect. The Nikkei has declined 5 per cent since what Trump called \"Liberation Day\", after posting huge swings last week. The sudden moves underscored investor anxieties as they tried to gauge the fallout from the U.S. trade policy. Still, shares of i Phone suppliers rose on Monday, with Murata Manufacturing gaining 1.65 per cent. TDK jumped 4.27 per cent and Taiyo Yuden surged 6 per cent. Chip-testing equipment maker Advantest jumped 4.92 per cent to provide the biggest boost to the Nikkei. Of more than 1,600 stocks trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's prime market, 80 per cent rose, 16 per cent fell, while 2 per cent traded flat.

This update has improved performance for many users, making sure smoother operation across a range of Apple products. However, it has not been without its challenges. Persistent bugs in the Podcasts and Voice Memos apps have left some users frustrated, particularly those who rely on these tools for daily tasks. These glitches, while not universal, have disrupted the seamless experience Apple users have come to expect. The video below from Brandon Butch gives us a look at iOS 18.4 and also the Apple News this week. Watch this video on YouTube . Apple has already begun work on iOS 18.4.1, which is expected to focus on bug fixes and security enhancements. This incremental update aims to address the lingering issues, reinforcing Apple\u2019s commitment to maintaining a high standard of reliability. Meanwhile, the iOS 18.5 beta introduces subtle design changes, such as updates to the Apple Care and Warranty section. While these tweaks improve usability, the absence of the highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features has left some users disappointed. Many had hoped for more significant advancements, raising questions about when these features will finally be introduced. iOS 19: A Glimpse Into the Future Looking ahead, iOS 19 is generating considerable excitement among Apple enthusiasts. Rumors suggest that Apple is planning a major overhaul of Siri , focusing on enhanced personalization capabilities. This update could enable Siri to deliver more tailored responses, adapting to individual user preferences and integrating seamlessly with advanced tools like photo editing features. Such improvements would mark a significant step forward in making Siri a more intuitive and versatile assistant. In addition to functional upgrades, iOS 19 is rumored to adopt a VisionOS-inspired design , featuring rounded icons and a more immersive interface. These aesthetic changes are expected to align with Apple\u2019s evolving design philosophy, creating a more cohesive and visually appealing user experience. If these updates come to fruition, iOS 19 could set a new benchmark for software design and functionality across Apple\u2019s ecosystem. With a potential release in the fall, anticipation is building for what could be one of Apple\u2019s most fantastic updates in recent years. WhatsApp and ChatGPT: Enhancing Everyday Tools Beyond iOS updates, popular apps like WhatsApp and ChatGPT are introducing significant improvements for Apple users. WhatsApp has rolled out several new features designed to enhance communication and productivity, including: Group chat online indicators for better visibility of active participants Enhanced video call functionality, improving the quality and reliability of virtual interactions Document scanning capabilities, streamlining the process of digitizing important files These updates make WhatsApp an even more versatile tool for both personal and professional use. Meanwhile, ChatGPT has expanded its memory capabilities , allowing it to reference past conversations for a more personalized experience. This development aligns with the growing demand for AI-powered tools that adapt to individual preferences. By integrating artificial intelligence more deeply into daily workflows, ChatGPT is becoming an increasingly valuable resource for users seeking efficiency and customization in their digital interactions. Apple Product Leaks and Ecosystem Evolution Speculation about upcoming Apple products continues to generate excitement. Reports suggest that production for the Vision Pro 2 is already underway, hinting at an earlier-than-expected launch. This next-generation device is expected to build on the innovations of its predecessor, further advancing Apple\u2019s ambitions in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Meanwhile, leaks about the iPhone 17 Pro have sparked discussions about potential design changes. While rumors of a two-tone back design have been debunked, reports indicate a larger camera bump, possibly to accommodate improved imaging technology. These developments suggest that Apple is prioritizing advancements in photography and videography, areas where it has consistently led the industry. In addition, WatchOS may soon adopt a VisionOS-inspired aesthetic , signaling Apple\u2019s broader push to unify its ecosystem. This design shift reflects Apple\u2019s commitment to creating a seamless user experience across devices, particularly as it explores new possibilities in AR and VR integration. Supply Chain Shifts and Tariff Impacts Apple is making significant changes to its supply chain, shifting a portion of its production to India . This move is part of a broader strategy to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing while mitigating the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. By diversifying its manufacturing base, Apple aims to enhance the resilience of its supply chain and navigate geopolitical challenges more effectively. While some analysts have speculated that this shift could lead to price increases for Apple products, substantial hikes are unlikely in the short term. Apple\u2019s focus remains on maintaining competitive pricing while making sure the quality and availability of its products. This strategic relocation underscores the company\u2019s commitment to adapting to global economic conditions while safeguarding its market position. Other Noteworthy Developments Apple continues to expand its ecosystem with new tools and features designed to enhance user experiences. The recently released Apple Immersive Video Utility app allows users to manage Vision Pro media more effectively, catering to the growing demand for AR and VR content. This tool reflects Apple\u2019s commitment to supporting its innovative hardware with robust software solutions. On the social media front, Instagram is testing a feature that requires secret codes to access certain Reels, adding an element of exclusivity to content sharing. This experimental feature could reshape how users engage with content on the platform, emphasizing privacy and selectivity. In the realm of home automation, Apple\u2019s Smart Home Hub has been delayed until 2026 due to engineering challenges related to Siri. This delay underscores the complexities of integrating advanced AI into smart home systems, highlighting the technical hurdles that must be overcome to deliver a seamless and reliable user experience. Despite these challenges, Apple remains committed to advancing its smart home initiatives, making sure that its ecosystem continues to evolve in line with user needs.

Seriens producenter Megan Ganz, David Hornsby och Rob McElhenney s\u00e4ger i ett uttalande om att Mythic Quest nu l\u00e4ggs ner: \"Endings are hard. But after four incredible seasons, \u2018Mythic Quest\u2019 is coming to a close.

To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Apple\u2019s blessing we made one final update to our last episode\u2014so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.\" Det uppdaterade finalavsnittet av Mythic Quest kommer att sl\u00e4ppas p\u00e5 Apple TV+ n\u00e5gon g\u00e5ng senare den h\u00e4r veckan. variety.com Film & TV , Apple TV+ , mythic quest , hejd\u00e5 , komedi Mythic Quest The head of a successful video game design company and his troubled staff struggle to keep their hit game 'Mythic Quest' on top.

Jag hatar innerligt uttryck som Teslad\u00f6dare. Men det h\u00e4r kan vara en. Eller den f\u00f6rsta av m\u00e5nga. Och det \u00e4r bra f\u00f6r alla. Tesla, och i Sverige framf\u00f6rallt Model Y, har under m\u00e5nga \u00e5r varit det slutgiltiga svaret p\u00e5 vilken elbil man ska k\u00f6pa om man bara vill ha en bil som kryssar i s\u00e5 m\u00e5nga rutor som det bara g\u00e5r. Som kanske inte \u00e4r b\u00e4st p\u00e5 allt men som \u00e4r bra p\u00e5 det mesta. TL;DR Zeekr levererar en riktigt trevlig suv som sl\u00e5r det mesta p\u00e5 fingrarna, inklusive Tesla. Man levererar mer och b\u00e4ttre p\u00e5 (n\u00e4stan) allt till en riktigt bra prislapp. Det \u00f6ppna m\u00e5l som Tesla har haft under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r \u00e4r nu officiellt st\u00e4ngt. F\u00f6r konkurrenterna har under alla \u00e5r kunnat vara bra p\u00e5 n\u00e5got, men inte p\u00e5 allt. D\u00e4r har Tesla varit b\u00e4st. Bra laddning (och framf\u00f6rallt n\u00e4tverk), gott om utrymmet, bra teknik \u00f6verlag, bra teknik i bilen, bra r\u00e4ckvidd och s\u00e5 vidare. Sen har Model Y varit en otroligt tr\u00e5kig bil att k\u00f6ra, men det har f\u00e5tt st\u00e5 undan n\u00e4r allt annat varit s\u00e5 bra. Tesla har ocks\u00e5 varit bra p\u00e5 att leverera detta till en, i elbilsv\u00e4rlden, vettig prislapp. Anonym rumpa utan loggor Men nu \u00e4r det slut p\u00e5 Teslas dominans. Kineserna, och i viss m\u00e5n europ\u00e9erna, har kommit i kapp, och nu \u00e4ven f\u00f6rbi. Den f\u00f6rsta bilen som visar detta p\u00e5 riktigt h\u00e4r i Sverige \u00e4r Zeekr 7X. Zeekr 7X \u00e4r suv-versionen av en modell som heter Zeekr 007 som aldrig kom hit men som finns i Kina. Eller det verkar som att kombiversionen faktiskt kommer hit, d\u00e5 under namnet Zeekr 7 GT. 35.4\u00b0 0 Jobbar du hemifr\u00e5n?

I serien f\u00e5r vi f\u00f6lja n\u00e5gra av de sista \u00f6verlevande m\u00e4nniskorna efter en zombieapokalyps med ett s\u00e4rskilt fokus p\u00e5 Joel (Pedro Pascal) och Ellie (Bella Ramsey). Den nya s\u00e4songen utspelar sig fem \u00e5r efter seriens f\u00f6rsta s\u00e4song. Joel och den 19-\u00e5riga Ellie h\u00e4nger fortfarande ihop, men relationen \u00e4r anstr\u00e4ngd efter att Joel tidigare f\u00f6rt Ellie bakom ljuset. I den nya s\u00e4songen introduceras \u00e4ven karakt\u00e4ren Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), som har en del otalt med Joel att g\u00f6ra upp, n\u00e5got som b\u00e4ddar f\u00f6r nya konflikter. Max b\u00f6rjade visa det f\u00f6rsta avsnittet i s\u00e4song tv\u00e5 av The Last of Us idag. S\u00e4songen best\u00e5r av sju avsnitt, och det sista avsnittet i s\u00e4songen kommer att visas den 26 maj. 42.4\u00b0 0 Klassisk Alfa Romeo Giulia med 670 h\u00e4star Henry k\u00f6r restomodden fr\u00e5n Totem Om man vill ha en bil med klassiskt Alfa Romeo-utseende kan man h\u00f6ra av sig till Totem Automobili som bygger GT Super. Det \u00e4r en restomoddad Giulia d\u00e4r i princip bara formerna finns kvar, allt annat \u00e4r uppdaterat och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrat. En sak kvarst\u00e5r dock - k\u00f6rgl\u00e4djen. Nu har Henry Catchpole f\u00e5tt k\u00f6ra besten och han diggar den stenh\u00e5rt. 38.8\u00b0 0 Fourier sl\u00e4pper open source-roboten N1 Bygg ihop din egen humanoida robot Fourier, en av Kinas ledande robottillverkare, har visat upp en humanoid open source-robot som man kallar f\u00f6r N1. Tanken bakom N1 \u00e4r bland annat att den ska locka fler utvecklare till robotbranschen. Fourier N1 \u00e4r 130 centimeter l\u00e5ng och v\u00e4ger 38 kg. Den kan r\u00f6ra sig fram\u00e5t i en hastighet p\u00e5 3,5 meter i sekunden, n\u00e5got som motsvarar cirka 12,5 km/h. Batteriet ska r\u00e4cka f\u00f6r drift i cirka tv\u00e5 timmar. Hela robotens design \u00e4r \u00f6ppen att ta del av och f\u00f6r\u00e4ndra under open source-licens. Det inneb\u00e4r att det kommer att bli m\u00f6jligt att ladda hem designen av roboten, vilka komponenter och material som anv\u00e4nts f\u00f6r att bygga den samt mjukvaran som driver roboten. I videoklippet nedan kan ni kolla in lite av vad Fourier N1 klarar av i sin grunddesign. 38.8\u00b0 0 Toshiba har gjort en b\u00e4rbar skivspelare Ta med dig dina LP-skivor med Aurex AX-RP10 Toshiba ger sig in i segmentet d\u00e4r vi hittar bland annat Audio-Technicas Sound Burger med nya Aurex AX-RP10, som \u00e4r en ny portabel skivspelare designad f\u00f6r vinylentusiaster som vill g\u00f6ra sina analoga musiksamlingar mer b\u00e4rbara. Aurex \u00e4r tillr\u00e4ckligt kompakt f\u00f6r att b\u00e4ras i en medf\u00f6ljande axelremsv\u00e4ska och klarar av att spela fullstora 12-tumsskivor. Den laddas med USB-C och har ett inbyggt batteri med upp till 10 timmars speltid. AX-RP10 spelar skivor i b\u00e5de 33 1/3 och 45 varv per minut, anv\u00e4nder MM-pickuper och \u00e4r remdriven. Den saknar inbyggda h\u00f6gtalare men erbjuder b\u00e5de en 3,5 mm ljudutg\u00e5ng f\u00f6r anslutning av h\u00f6rlurar eller en extern ljudanl\u00e4ggning, samt Bluetooth f\u00f6r tr\u00e5dl\u00f6s koppling till h\u00f6rlurar och h\u00f6gtalare. Vad priset kommer att hamna p\u00e5 vet vi inte \u00e4nnu, men skivspelaren f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntas b\u00f6rja levereras n\u00e5gon g\u00e5ng nu under april. 37.5\u00b0 0 Polestar verkar dra ner i Kina Avbryter samarbete med Meizu Polestar m\u00e5 vara en produkt sprungen ur Volvo, men mycket fokus har legat p\u00e5 Kina f\u00f6r varum\u00e4rket. Man har i princip all tillverkning d\u00e4r, f\u00f6rutom Polestar 3 som ocks\u00e5 ska tillverkas i USA. Man har \u00e4ven teknikcenter i Nanjing. Men det g\u00e5r s\u00e5d\u00e4r med f\u00f6rs\u00e4ljningen, man s\u00e5lde bara drygt 3000 bilar i Kina under f\u00f6rra \u00e5ret. Totalt s\u00e5lde man 44.850 bilar. Det ska dock s\u00e4gas att Polestar 4, som nog fr\u00e4mst \u00e4r den modell som kan fungera i Kina, kom f\u00f6rst i slutet av \u00e5ret. Nu verkar man dra ner p\u00e5 fokuset p\u00e5 landet. Om man vill k\u00f6pa en Polestar s\u00e5 finns det fortfarande 36 st\u00e4llen att bes\u00f6ka enligt hemsidan, men i appen ska det bara finnas tio platser att provk\u00f6ra. Tio st\u00e4llen \u00e4r v\u00e4ldigt lite \u00e4ven i Sverige. Man har \u00e4ven avslutat samarbetet med Meizu som man har haft ett tag. Det resulterade bland annat i en mobiltelefon, men Meizu har \u00e4ven hj\u00e4lpt till med f\u00f6rs\u00e4ljning och kundservice. Om man drar ner p\u00e5 riktigt eller om man t\u00e4nker ta nya tag fram\u00f6ver \u00e4r oklart. 37.5\u00b0 0 Mercedes T-Klass och Citan s\u00e4ljer f\u00f6r d\u00e5ligt L\u00e4ggs ner V\u00e5ren 2022 lanserade Mercedes den nya modellen T-Klass som \u00e4r en liten minibuss. Det \u00e4r en slags m\u00e4nnisko-version av den befintliga modellen Citan som \u00e4r en klassisk hantverkarbil. Nu l\u00e4ggs b\u00e4gge modellerna ner f\u00f6r att de s\u00e4ljer f\u00f6r d\u00e5ligt. N\u00e4sta \u00e5r kommer tillverkningen att upph\u00f6ra och Mercedes kommer ist\u00e4llet att fokusera p\u00e5 st\u00f6rre modeller som \u00e4r mer l\u00f6nsamma. N\u00e5gra direkta ers\u00e4ttare \u00e4r i dagsl\u00e4get inte planerade. F\u00f6rra \u00e5ret s\u00e5ldes 23.351 exemplar av Citan och bara 5117 av T-Klass. 37.7\u00b0 0 Samsung presenterar nya strykt\u00e5liga enheter Galaxy XCover7 Pro har ett l\u00f6stagbart batteri Nu har Samsung presenterat tv\u00e5 nya strykt\u00e5liga enheter designade f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsanv\u00e4ndare och lite mer kr\u00e4vande arbetsmilj\u00f6er. Vi har den nya telefonen Galaxy XCover7 Pro tillsammans med surfplattan Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro.

Prestandan har uppgraderats med Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 p\u00e5 b\u00e5da enheterna, 6 eller 8 GB RAM, 5G-st\u00f6d och Wi-Fi 6E. Ut\u00f6ver det f\u00e5r \u00e4ven b\u00e5da enheterna f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrade stereoh\u00f6gtalare med anti-feedback-teknik f\u00f6r tydligare kommunikation vid till exempel walkie-talkie-anv\u00e4ndning, Vision Booster f\u00f6r b\u00e4ttre sk\u00e4rml\u00e4sbarhet utomhus, programmerbara knappar f\u00f6r snabb\u00e5tkomst till funktioner, st\u00f6d f\u00f6r Samsung DeX samt Galaxy AI-funktioner. Galaxy XCover7 Pro \u00e4r utrustad med ett batteri p\u00e5 4350 mAh som kan bytas ut enkelt av anv\u00e4ndaren. Surfplattan Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro har ett st\u00f6rre batteri p\u00e5 10.100 mAh med unik Dual Hot-Swap-funktionalitet som till\u00e5ter batteribyte under drift utan att st\u00e4nga av enheten, samt ett \"No Battery Mode\" f\u00f6r drift via fast str\u00f6mk\u00e4lla. Tab Active5 Pro har \u00e4ven st\u00f6d f\u00f6r S Pen och ett fram\u00e5triktat NFC-chip f\u00f6r anv\u00e4ndning som exempelvis mobil betalterminal. B\u00e5de Galaxy XCover7 Pro och Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro b\u00f6rjar s\u00e4ljas nu i april. 38.5\u00b0 0 Hitta hemligt rum i nya spelet Blue Prince I ett hus som konstant f\u00f6r\u00e4ndras Blue Prince \u00e4r ett nysl\u00e4ppt spel som har f\u00e5tt en hel del bra recensioner sedan det sl\u00e4pptes f\u00f6rra veckan. Spelet \u00e4r utvecklat av Dogubomb och utgivet av Raw Fury och \u00e4r ett slags pusselspel d\u00e4r uppgifterna som ska l\u00f6sas f\u00f6r\u00e4ndras p\u00e5 daglig basis. Raw Fury skriver om spelet: \"Welcome to Mt. Holly, where every dawn unveils a new mystery. Navigate through shifting corridors and ever-changing chambers in this genre-defying strategy puzzle adventure. But will your unpredictable path lead you to the rumored Room 46? Upon reaching a closed door in Mt. Holly, you decide what room appears behind it and each decision shapes your path as you navigate through the manor. Every door can reveal new and exciting chambers that contain their own unique challenges and secrets. But be careful how you draft, for each day the manor\u2019s floor plan resets and the rooms you saw today may not be the same rooms you see tomorrow.\" Blue Prince sl\u00e4pps till PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S och PC. Ni hittar en trailer f\u00f6r spelet nedan. 38.8\u00b0 0 Nytt v\u00e4rldsrekord f\u00f6r eldriven motorcykel Kom 31 mil p\u00e5 en laddning Visst, 31 mil l\u00e5ter ju inte s\u00e5 v\u00e4rst l\u00e5ngt, men det \u00e4r tydligen tillr\u00e4ckligt f\u00f6r att kunna s\u00e4tta nytt v\u00e4rldsrekord i r\u00e4ckvidd p\u00e5 en laddning f\u00f6r eldrivna motorcyklar. Detta \u00e4r precis vad tillverkaren Verge Motorcycles nyligen gjorde med modellen TS Pro. Hojen v\u00e4ger in p\u00e5 245 kilo och motorn som sitter i bakhjulet \u00e4r p\u00e5 140 h\u00e4star har hela 1000 newtonmeter i vrid. K\u00f6rningen genomf\u00f6rdes inte med full gas p\u00e5 motorv\u00e4g utan under hela 16 timmar p\u00e5 en slinga runt Londons med en snitthastighet p\u00e5 l\u00e5ga 19 km/h. N\u00e4r man v\u00e4l var klara fanns det fortfarande sju procent (2,5 mil) kvar i batteriet. TS Pro ska p\u00e5 pappret komma 35 mil p\u00e5 en laddning och priset b\u00f6rjar p\u00e5 29.900 dollar. 38.3\u00b0 0 Spela Doom p\u00e5 en spelf\u00f6rpackning DOOM + DOOM II Will It Run Edition blir ditt f\u00f6r 666 dollar Snart kommer det en nyutg\u00e5va av id Softwares klassiska spel Doom och Doom II som levereras i en f\u00f6rpackning som har en spelbar version av Doom inbyggd.

Tanken bakom designen p\u00e5 sadeln \"VabsRider\" \u00e4r att den ska kunna r\u00f6ra sig i takt med att cyklisten trampar p\u00e5 pedalerna, n\u00e5got som f\u00f6retaget s\u00e4ger ska minska risken f\u00f6r sm\u00e4rtor. F\u00f6retaget skriver om den ergonomiska cykelsadeln: \"Butt-friendly bike seat moves with your legs. If you donx27t want a part of your body to get sore, then that part shouldnx27t be pushing against something that doesnx27t move along with it. Thatx27s the thinking behind the vabsRider bicycle saddle.\" Sadeln ska passa p\u00e5 de flesta cykelmodeller och kunna justeras individuellt med hj\u00e4lp av olika inst\u00e4llningar. Den \u00e4r t\u00e4nkt att finansieras via en crowdfundingkampanj som ska dra ig\u00e5ng den 1 maj. H\u00e4r nedanf\u00f6r kan ni kolla in en presentation av VabsRider. 41.9\u00b0 0 Teaser f\u00f6r suven Cyber X Nytt fr\u00e5n MG Senare den h\u00e4r m\u00e5naden \u00e4r det \u00e5terigen dags f\u00f6r Shanghai Auto Show och d\u00e4r kommer MG att st\u00e4lla ut.

Alla som sett serien Severance p\u00e5 Apple TV+ har nog \u00e5tminstone funderat p\u00e5 hur det hade varit att ha ett av tangentborden och arbetsstationerna fr\u00e5n serien. Snart beh\u00f6ver du inte undra l\u00e4nge. F\u00f6retaget Atomic Keyboard ska n\u00e4mligen sl\u00e4ppa MDR Dasher Keyboard, som \u00e4r ett nytt tangentbord som h\u00e4mtat stark inspiration fr\u00e5n serien. Designen \u00e4r en n\u00e4ra replika av de retro-terminaler som anv\u00e4nds p\u00e5 den fiktiva arbetsplatsen Lumon Industries, som i sin tur \u00e4r baserade p\u00e5 verklighetens Data General Dasher-terminaler fr\u00e5n 70- och 80-talet. Tangentbordet har en kompakt 70-procent-layout med 73 tangenter i bl\u00e5tt och vitt, ett chassi i aluminium samt en optisk styrkula placerad p\u00e5 h\u00f6ger sida. Den mest anm\u00e4rkningsv\u00e4rda designdetaljen \u00e4r dock att tangentbordet saknar Escape-, Control- och Option-tangenter, som en blinkning till seriens teman om inst\u00e4ngdhet och brist p\u00e5 kontroll. MDR Dasher riktar sig d\u00e4rf\u00f6r fr\u00e4mst till samlare och stora fans av serien. Det kostar 400 US-dollar och finns nu att f\u00f6rhandsboka i en begr\u00e4nsad upplaga. 39.1\u00b0 0 Han lurade folk att Tesla k\u00f6pt Max Lyckat aprilsk\u00e4mt F\u00f6r ett tag sedan var det 1 april och det lurades hej vilt till h\u00f6ger och v\u00e4nster. En som kom p\u00e5 ett ganska s\u00e5 kul lur var Youtubern Fabian Svorono. Han kokade ihop att Tesla hade k\u00f6pt hamburgerkedjan Max. Han hyrde tv\u00e5 Teslor, parkerade dessa utanf\u00f6r en Max-restaurang i Stockholm, gjorde rollups och delade ut gratis kaffe till f\u00f6rbipasserande. Han hade faktiskt \u00e4ven fixat tillst\u00e5nd f\u00f6r att f\u00e5 st\u00e5 p\u00e5 platsen och varken ordningsvakterna, restaurangchefen eller polisen hade n\u00e5got att s\u00e4ga om saken. Lyckat sk\u00e4mt helt klart! Gick du p\u00e5 n\u00e5got riktigt bra aprilsk\u00e4mt? 24.7\u00b0 0 H\u00e4r \u00e4r f\u00f6rsta trailern f\u00f6r Ari Asters n\u00e4sta film Med Joaquin Phoenix Nu g\u00e5r det att kika p\u00e5 den f\u00f6rsta trailern fr\u00e5n Ari Asters n\u00e4sta film Eddington, som utspelar sig under pandemin 2020, d\u00e4r den dyker in i den v\u00e4xande politiska klyftan i USA.

Kronkursen fortsatte att st\u00e4rkas mot dollarn under dagen och i skrivande stund kostar en dollar 9,66 kronor. Det kan j\u00e4mf\u00f6ras med att en dollar kostade 11,07 kronor vid \u00e5rsskiftet, n\u00e5got som inneb\u00e4r att kronkursen har \u00f6kat med \u00f6ver 14 procent j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med dollarn sedan dess. En euro kostar nu 10,98 kronor vilket kan j\u00e4mf\u00f6ras med de 11,45 kronor euron kostade vid \u00e5rsskiftet, en \u00f6kning f\u00f6r kronan med lite \u00f6ver 4 procent. Anledningen till att kronan har st\u00e4rkts den senaste tiden verkar bero p\u00e5 att investerare anser att kronan \u00e4r en n\u00e5gorlunda trygg valuta, n\u00e5got som vanligtvis inte \u00e4r fallet. Robert Bergqvist, SEB:s seniorekonom, s\u00e4ger till TT: \u2013 Det \u00e4r v\u00e4ldigt ovanligt det vi ser nu. N\u00e4r det \u00e4r st\u00f6kigt och oroliga tider brukar man ist\u00e4llet s\u00f6ka sig bort fr\u00e5n de mindre valutorna som till exempel den svenska kronan. \u2013 Men nu har det h\u00e4r m\u00f6nstret f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrats. Nu har det n\u00e4stan blivit tv\u00e4rtom. Det vill s\u00e4ga att dollarn har blivit en cyklisk valuta, som tappar n\u00e4r oron \u00f6kar. Medan kronan har blivit en s\u00e5 kallad defensiv valuta som m\u00e5nga s\u00f6ker till f\u00f6r trygghet. 61.0\u00b0 0 SVT tidigarel\u00e4gger Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen Drar ig\u00e5ng i natt SVT meddelade idag att man kommer att b\u00f6rja s\u00e4nda sin slow-tv-show Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen en vecka tidigare \u00e4n planerat. Anledningen till tidigarel\u00e4ggningen av programmet beror p\u00e5 att v\u00e4rmen gjort att \u00e4lgarna redan har b\u00f6rjat vandra, n\u00e5got som tvingat SVT att g\u00f6ra en \u00e4ndring i sitt s\u00e4ndningsprogram. Stefan Edlund, producent av Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen, s\u00e4ger: \u2013 Det \u00e4r full trafik av \u00e4lgar. De st\u00e5r och v\u00e4ntar p\u00e5 oss. Vi m\u00e5ste g\u00f6ra en stor justering utifr\u00e5n v\u00e5r grundplan. Vi f\u00f6rs\u00f6ker anpassa oss efter v\u00e5rens villkor.

Den f\u00f6rsta varianten av Vision Pro, som lanserades i USA i februari f\u00f6rra \u00e5ret, kostar fortfarande fr\u00e5n 500 dollar och v\u00e4ger cirka 680 gram. Ut\u00f6ver den l\u00e4ttare och billigare modellen uppger Gurman att Apple \u00e4ven utvecklar en annan version av Vision Pro som ska kunna anslutas med kabel direkt till en Mac-dator. Syftet med detta \u00e4r att skapa en upplevelse med extremt l\u00e5g f\u00f6rdr\u00f6jning. Med detta skulle man kunna f\u00f6rlita sig b\u00e4ttre p\u00e5 kr\u00e4vande professionella applikationer genom att str\u00f6mma Mac-sk\u00e4rmen eller anv\u00e4nda headsetet f\u00f6r exempelvis kirurgisk bildvisning eller i flygsimulatorer. Det \u00e4r i nul\u00e4get oklart n\u00e4r Apple planerar att lansera n\u00e5gon av dessa nya headset-versioner.

Den nya serietidningen har titeln \"Godzilla Destroys the Marvel Universe\" och kommer att ges ut i fem nummer med start den 16 juli. Handlingen kretsar runt hur Godzilla vaknar upp och hotar att f\u00f6rst\u00f6ra v\u00e4rlden. Efter att Marvel-hj\u00e4ltarna inte lyckas besegra besten p\u00e5 egen hand tvingas de kalla in n\u00e5gra av jordens v\u00e4rsta superskurkar f\u00f6r att tillsammans f\u00f6rs\u00f6ka ge Godzilla en match. Bland superhj\u00e4ltarna som ska stoppa Godzilla finns bland andra The Fantastic Four, X-Men, Spider-Man och Avengers.

Sovs\u00e4cken \"Wrap Sack\" skiljer sig lite fr\u00e5n traditionella sovs\u00e4ckar d\u00e5 den har en vingliknande design med dubbla \u00f6verlager. Tanken bakom designen \u00e4r att den ska ge den sovande mer utrymme att v\u00e4nda sig och att den inte ska ge samma \"korvk\u00e4nsla\" som traditionella sovs\u00e4ckar ibland kan ge. Det g\u00e5r att st\u00e4nga igen Wrap Sack med ett blixtl\u00e5s och det finns \u00e4ven ett separat blixtl\u00e5s i sovs\u00e4ckens botten f\u00f6r dem som vill lufta f\u00f6tterna.

Priset p\u00e5 standardversionen av PS5 med inbyggd skivl\u00e4sare f\u00f6rblir dock of\u00f6r\u00e4ndrat. \u00c4ven i Australien och Nya Zeeland h\u00f6js priserna p\u00e5 b\u00e5da PS5-modellerna, medan USA dock konstigt nog klarar sig utan n\u00e5gra pris\u00e4ndringar.

Totalt ska det handla om 250.000 ton utsl\u00e4ppsminskning som tillfaller Sverige fram till 2030, det motsvarar cirka 2 procent av utsl\u00e4ppen som uppstod fr\u00e5n bilk\u00f6rning i Sverige under f\u00f6rra \u00e5ret. Det kommer att kosta 400 kronor per ton utsl\u00e4ppsminskning. Det \u00e4r betydligt billigare \u00e4n de cirka 700 kronor per ton utsl\u00e4ppsr\u00e4tter kostade i genomsnitt i EU:s utsl\u00e4ppshandel under 2024. Regeringen planerar att l\u00e4gga 1,5 miljarder kronor p\u00e5 klimat\u00e5tg\u00e4rder i andra l\u00e4nder fram till 2036. \u00c5tg\u00e4rderna har dock f\u00e5tt kritik d\u00e5 det anses sv\u00e5rt att ber\u00e4kna hur stora utsl\u00e4ppsminskningar klimatprojekt i fattiga l\u00e4nder faktiskt ger. 7.0\u00b0 0 Audio-Technica har ocks\u00e5 gjort en lysande skivspelare Finns i 1000 exemplar Audio-Technica h\u00e4rmar Brian Eno och sl\u00e4pper nu sin egen lysande skivspelare med namnet Hotaru (AT-FTT) under designveckan i Milano. Skivspelaren har en belyst skivtallrik i akryl vars belysning kan synkroniseras med musiken och lysa i 20 olika f\u00e4rger. Den har tre ljusl\u00e4gen: konstant f\u00e4rg, f\u00e4rg som \u00e4ndras i takt med musiken, eller en mjuk \u00f6verg\u00e5ng mellan f\u00e4rgerna. Namnet Hotaru betyder f\u00f6rresten eldfluga p\u00e5 japanska. F\u00f6r att minimera vibrationer sv\u00e4var akryltallriken magnetiskt ovanf\u00f6r basen, och driften sker via en rem som \u00e4r dold inuti aluminiumchassit. Endast 1000 exemplar av Hotaru kommer att tillverkas globalt, och priset \u00e4r satt till 9999 dollar. F\u00f6r att kunna k\u00f6pa ett exemplar m\u00e5ste intresserade f\u00f6rst registrera sitt intresse online via Audio-Technicas webbplats.

Det f\u00f6rutsp\u00e5r iallafall Bloombergs Mark Gurman. Han skriver att \u00e4ven om vi inte kommer att f\u00e5 riktiga macOS p\u00e5 iPad, s\u00e5 kommer f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringarna att vara tillr\u00e4ckligt stora f\u00f6r att tillfredsst\u00e4lla de anv\u00e4ndare som l\u00e4nge \u00f6nskat en mer Mac-liknande upplevelse p\u00e5 iPad. Enligt Gurman kommer uppdateringar i iPadOS 19 att fokusera p\u00e5 produktivitet, multitasking och f\u00f6nsterhantering, med m\u00e5let att f\u00e5 enheten att fungera mer som en Mac. Dessa st\u00f6rre, mer Mac-lika f\u00f6r\u00e4ndringar v\u00e4ntas dock f\u00f6rst \"omkring ett \u00e5r\" efter lanseringen av M4 iPad Pro.

Kopplet har bland annat en n\u00f6dbroms inbyggd som aktiveras om kopplet k\u00e4nner av att hunden f\u00f6rs\u00f6ker springa iv\u00e4g, n\u00e5got som kanske g\u00f6r att hunden inte kommer upp i de hastigheter som kr\u00e4vs f\u00f6r att rycka kopplet ur hund\u00e4garens hand. Det finns \u00e4ven inbyggd belysning som g\u00e5r att justera i olika styrkor samt en timer som signalerar n\u00e4r hunden f\u00e5tt 30 minuters tr\u00e4ning. Kopplet laddar upp det inbyggda batteriet sj\u00e4lv genom den kinetiska energi som genereras n\u00e4r kopplet dras in och ut ur sitt fodral. Hello.it:s Pet Power Leash finansieras via crowdfunding p\u00e5 Kickstarter. Hoppar man p\u00e5 den kampanjen kostar kopplet cirka 615 kronor och leveranserna ska dra ig\u00e5ng i juni 2025.

Brevl\u00e5dor \u00e4r ju till f\u00f6r brev, men det skickas ju inte s\u00e5 mycket brev l\u00e4ngre. Paket d\u00e4remot, det skickar vi som aldrig f\u00f6rr. Brittiska Royal Mail har d\u00e4rf\u00f6r tagit fram en ny brev-och-paketl\u00e5da som har plats f\u00f6r b\u00e5da sorterna. Man har beh\u00e5llit den ikoniska designen men adderat en ny lucka under den klassiska f\u00f6r breven. I denna kan man stoppa in mindre paket. Men f\u00f6r att man ska f\u00e5 \u00f6ppna denna s\u00e5 m\u00e5ste man f\u00f6rst l\u00e4sa av paketets kod s\u00e5 att luckan sedan ska \u00f6ppnas. Detta f\u00f6r att folk inte ska anv\u00e4nda l\u00e5dan som soptunna. P\u00e5 l\u00e5dan finns en kamera som l\u00e4ser av paketets kod och tekniken i l\u00e5dan drivs av solceller. Man har placerat ut fem s\u00e5dana h\u00e4r l\u00e5dor i ett pilotprojekt f\u00f6r att se hur det g\u00e5r. Royal Mail har 115.000 brevl\u00e5dor utplacerade och 98 procent av adresserna i landet finns mindre \u00e4n 800 meter fr\u00e5n dessa l\u00e5dor. 48.8\u00b0 0 Kina pausar export av s\u00e4llsynta jordartsmetaller Efter att handelskriget med USA eskalerat Kina har stoppat exporten av sju sorters s\u00e4llsynta jordartsmetaller, n\u00e5got som tros ha att g\u00f6ra med det eskalerande handelskriget mellan USA och Kina. Kina producerar 90 procent av v\u00e4rldens s\u00e4llsynta jordartsmetaller, metaller som \u00e4r viktiga f\u00f6r komponenter inom bland annat fordons- halvledar- och f\u00f6rsvarsindustrin. F\u00f6r att exportera metallerna m\u00e5ste de kinesiska export\u00f6rerna nu ans\u00f6ka om en licens hos landets handelsdepartement. Enligt k\u00e4llor som nyhetsbyr\u00e5n Reuters varit i kontakt med kan det ta minst tv\u00e5 m\u00e5nader innan Kina till\u00e5ter export av metallerna igen, n\u00e5got som kan st\u00e4lla till det f\u00f6r f\u00f6retag runt om i v\u00e4rlden som \u00e4r beroende av metallerna f\u00f6r sin produktion. Enligt New York Times k\u00e4llor ska framtida kinesisk export av metallerna kunna stoppas permanent till vissa f\u00f6retag, bland annat underleverant\u00f6rer till den amerikanska milit\u00e4ren. 48.3\u00b0 0 McMurtry k\u00f6r sin bil upp-och-ner Genererar 2000 kilos marktryck - fr\u00e5n 0 km/h Vi har skrivit om McMurtrys supersnabba Sp\u00e9irling tidigare.

However, the chip sector faced headwinds due to national security concerns. This exemption raised hopes for improved trade relations, supported by better-than-expected loan data and anticipated policy support. AP China and Hong Kong stocks rebounded on Monday, fueled by gains in tech shares after the U.S. exempted smartphones and computers from tariffs. China and Hong Kong stocks rose on Monday as tech shares climbed after the White House exempted smartphones and computers from \"reciprocal\" U.S. tariffs, while the chip sector was weighed down by national security concerns . China's blue-chip CSI300 Index climbed 0.5%, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.9% by the midday trading break, after losing 2.9% and 3.1% last week, respectively. Hong Kong benchmark's Hang Seng climbed 2.4% after an 8.5% loss last week. The Hang Seng Tech Index added 2.7%. Trump's administration granted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and other electronics imported largely from China, while indicating these goods will come under separate tariffs, along with semiconductors, that may be imposed within a month. China's Apple suppliers jumped on the temporary relief. The CSI Electronics Index jumped 0.9% by midday. Apple's main assembly partner Foxconn Industrial Internet rallied 1.1%, and acoustic components manufacturer Goertek jumped 2.5%. Live Events Keeping a lid on gains, the CSI Semiconductor Index declined as much as 0.9% after Trump said that chips from China will face a national security probe over the next week. The news of the exemption \"fuels expectation of potential improvement in trade relations, and even the prospect of trade negotiations,\" said Li Shuding, an investor adviser of Galaxy Securities. He added that March loan data was better than expected, and \"we expect intensive roll-out of policies\" to support the economy. Before Monday's rebound, the CSI 300 Index and Hang Seng Index had lost 3.5% and 9.9%, respectively, since \"Liberation Day\" on April 2. Trump threatened to implement sweeping tariffs against trading partners with China being the major target, raising concerns about slowing global economic growth and disruptions to trade. Goldman Sachs has revised its 12-month targets for MSCI China and the CSI300 Index, lowering them to 75 and 4,300, respectively, down from previous estimates of 81 and 4,500, respectively. \" U.S.-China trade tensions have soared to unprecedented levels, prompting concerns about global recession, and decoupling risks between the two largest economies globally in other strategic cohorts, notably capital markets, technology, and geopolitics,\" China strategist Kinger Lau said in a note on Monday. Elsewhere, China's exports in March rose 12.4% from a year earlier, handily beating 4.4% growth expected in a Reuters poll of economists after factories rushed out shipments before the latest U.S. tariffs took effect.

Last week, it was learnt that the carmaker rolled out the Flyme Auto S version 1.1.4 firmware update for a host of fixes . According to a presentation slide that was photographed, the over-the-air updates are pushed to customer vehicles on a quarterly basis. Completed so far as of its April OTA update are charging start/stop button, optimised braking and the ability for owners to view the vehicle\u2019s location when it is asleep. The next update set for the second quarter of this year, to be rolled out approximately in July, will include wireless Apple CarPlay, switchable \u201cice-cream van\u201d sound , access to third-party apps, radio scanning fix, as well as other to-be-announced improvements. This will be followed by updates scheduled for Q3 2025, to be released approximately in October. These will include wired Apple CarPlay, a memory function for speed warning switching, and other improvements. Wrapping up the updates timeline in Q4 2025 in December will be wired and wireless Android Auto, along with other updates. Launched towards the end of last year, the Proton eMas 7 made its debut with two variants \u2013 Prime and Premium \u2013 each with a front-mounted electric motor producing 218 PS and 320 Nm. This propels Proton\u2019s first electric SUV from 0-100 km/h in 6.9 seconds and on to a top speed of 175 km/h. The Prime starts the range with a 49.52 kWh battery offering 345 km of range while the Premium brings a 60.022 kWh unit that is good for 410 km (both on the WLTP testing standard), and both are the Geely Aegis short-blade lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery. Charging the eMas 7 from 30 to 80% takes 20 minutes using DC fast charging at up to 100 kW with the Premium (80 kW for the Prime), while a full charge using an 11 kW AC wallbox takes 4.9 hours for the Prime and 6.1 hours for the Premium. The eMas 7 is also the first Proton to get a suite of driver assistance features, including Level 2 semi-autonomous driving capabilities. Looking to sell your car? Sell it with Carro .

By Debby Wu, Josh Wingrove, and Shawn Donnan, Bloomberg | Updated: 14 April 2025 13:03 IST Photo Credit: Apple Trump\u2019s tariffs upended global markets, triggered a selloff in stocks Highlights The exclusions were published late Friday US Customs and Border Protection published the exclusions The move is the first major softening of any kind in Trump\u2019s conflicts Advertisement President Donald Trump's administration exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs, representing a major reprieve for global technology manufacturers including Apple and Nvidia even if it proves a temporary one. The exclusions, published late Friday by US Customs and Border Protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump's 125 percent China tariff and his baseline 10 percent global tariff on nearly all other countries. The exclusions apply to smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips as well as flat-screen displays. Those popular consumer electronics items generally aren't made in the US. Apple Said to Have Airlifted 600 Tons of iPhones From India The pause will be welcome news to consumers, some of whom rushed to buy new iPhones and other devices amid fears that the tariffs would send prices soaring. It's also a big win for major technology companies that have presented massive US spending pledges for Trump in recent months. Trump's tariffs upended global markets, triggered a selloff in stocks and ignited a rapidly escalating trade war with China. The move is the first significant softening of any kind in Trump's conflict with China. It was backdated to April 5. The exemptions cover almost $390 billion (roughly Rs. 33,57,764 crore) in US imports based on official US 2024 trade statistics, including more than $101 billion (roughly Rs. 86,9,574 crore) from China, according to data compiled by Gerard DiPippo, associate director of the Rand China Research Center. Apple Exported $17 Billion in iPhones From India Last Year, Minister Says The biggest category related to China is smartphones. The US imported smartphones valued at more than $41 billion (roughly Rs. 3,52,995 crore) from China in 2024, or about nine percent of total imports from China. Also covered are computers and similar devices, of which the US imported more than $36 billion (roughly Rs 3,09.947 crore) in 2024. Altogether the exemptions cover consumer electronics and semiconductors that accounted for about 22 percent of US imports from China in 2024, DiPippo said. \u201cThis is a large hole in the US tariff wall that will spare key firms like Apple and consumers of laptops and phones from sticker shock,\u201d he said. \u201cBut many other consumer, intermediate, and capital goods from China still face prohibitively high US tariffs. This exemption only covers one segment of the US economy.\u201d Trump on Saturday declined to elaborate on the exemptions but hinted at further developments on Monday. \u201cI'll give you that answer on Monday. We'll be very specific on Monday,\u201d he told reporters on Air Force One. \u201cWe're taking in a lot of money; as a country we're taking in a lot of money.\u201d The White House also released a corresponding memo indicating that the exemptions also extend to changes in small-parcel shipping duties. Trump had moved to end the so-called \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, beginning with China, that generally means parcels worth $800 (roughly Rs. 68,880) or below don't face duties. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacturing critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cThat's why the president has secured trillions of dollars in US investments from the largest tech companies in the world.\u201d She said those companies are \u201chustling to onshore\u201d their manufacturing to the US. The tariff reprieve may prove fleeting. The exclusions stem from the initial order, which prevented extra tariffs on certain sectors from stacking cumulatively on top of the country-wide rates. The exclusion is a sign that the products may soon be subject to a different tariff, albeit almost surely a lower one for China. The products that won't be subject to Trump's new tariffs include machines used to make semiconductors. That would be important for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has announced a major new investment in the US, as well as other chipmakers. \u201cAll products that are properly classified in these listed provisions will be excluded from the reciprocal tariffs,\u201d the notice said. The move appeared to exclude the products from the 10 percent global baseline tariff on other countries, including Samsung Electronics' home of South Korea. The tariff reprieve does not extend to a separate Trump levy on China \u2014 a 20 percent duty applied to pressure Beijing to crack down on fentanyl, including the shipment of precursor materials. Other previously existing levies, including those that predate Trump's current term, also appear unaffected. \u201cThe US tech industry has a loud voice and despite initial strong pushback against exemptions within the White House the reality of the situation was finally recognised in the Beltway,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Saturday. \u201cThere is still clear uncertainty and volatility ahead with these China negotiations.\u201d The original list of tariff exemptions included some semiconductor products \u2014 including central processing units known as CPUs. But those measures did not carve out tech products crucial to AI development including graphics processing units, or GPUs, and the servers that they power. Servers powered by AI chips from companies such as Nvidia and their critical components are primarily manufactured and assembled in Taiwan and Mexico. Friday's announcement would cover both Taiwanese and Mexican production, in a significant reprieve for companies seeking to build AI infrastructure in the US. Semiconductor Equipment Exemptions Also crucial are new exemptions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment, made by companies such as ASML Holding NV in the Netherlands and Tokyo Electron Ltd. in Japan. Those tools are essential for building chip factories, and comprise the lion's share of the multibillion dollar price tag for such plants. Companies including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel Corp. are building new US facilities with support from the 2022 Chips and Science Act. Trump's initial \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff announcement included exemptions for semiconductors and other sectors, to which Trump has regularly pledged to apply a specific tariff. He hasn't yet done so but the latest exclusions are related to that exemption. The move excludes most of Apple's core products from the escalating tariffs on China, including iPhones, iPads and Apple watches. Apple shares have slid since Trump announced the tariffs. Discussions gained additional urgency in recent days after Trump increased the tariffs on China, putting companies like Apple in a more difficult position than competitors like Samsung, who are less reliant on China. Companies and tech industry lobbyists have also argued that reshoring the final assembly of smartphones and other products is impossible, one person familiar with the discussions said. But the move also is aimed at laying the groundwork for new targeted sectoral tariffs that are likely to hit the industry. The administration is expected to soon launch a new investigation into imports of semiconductors. That would eventually lead to the imposition of tariffs on chips within weeks or months. Those duties, like ones imposed recently on steel and aluminum, are likely to impose duties on products that include semiconductors as well as the chips themselves. Trump's sectoral tariffs have so far been set at 25 percent, though it's not clear what his rate on semiconductors and related products would be. It's also not clear how widely he would apply that tariff. Representatives from Nvidia and ASML declined to comment. Spokesmen for Tokyo Electron didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The US International Trade Commission declined to comment on the exemptions, while the US Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce didn't respond to requests for comment. \u00a9 2025 Bloomberg LP (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Facebook X LinkedIn Copy to Clipboard Copy North America Analysis Economy Technology World Tech tariff trainwreck: Mad King Donald backflips on the backflip Can you backflip on a backflip after another backflip? That\u2019s what Donald Trump has done with his \u2018exemption\u2019 for computer equipment. Bernard Keane Glenn Dyer Apr 14, 2025 4 min read Share 0 US President Donald Trump (Image: ABACAPRESS/Matias J. Ocner) The working rule for any major announcement by Donald Trump is that it will be reversed, modified or dismissed as never having happened within a matter of days. And that appears to apply as much to the reversals and modifications themselves. So that tariff backflip revealed on Friday (not the initial backflip, to reduce tariffs to 10% for everyone other than China, but the backflip to exclude semiconductor chips, smartphones and laptops made in China from the-nearly 150% tariffs on China) which was widely seen to have saved the bacon of Apple , given its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, turns out not to be an exemption at all. There will instead be a specific tech tariff, the administration said yesterday. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019,\u201d Trump raved . \u201cThere was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019 The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d The additional tech tariffs won\u2019t be revealed for one to two months, presumably giving the administration time to cobble together an equivalent to the kind of irrational, innumerate mathematical model it used to work up its now-ditched \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 1202161 Trump wants allies in his war on China. Albanese and Marles will bend the knee \u2014 as will Dutton Bernard Keane 139 Friday\u2019s electronics backflip-that-wasn\u2019t was disseminated not via a White House PR stunt but a US Customs and Border Protection Service notice to shippers, which contained a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes, retroactive to 12.01am EDT (3.01pm Sydney time) on Saturday, April 5. Reuters reported that the notice \u201clisted 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays\u201d. That still leaves billions of dollars worth of kitchen and other households goods, toys, foodstuffs, machinery, car parts and similar products still paying the 145% China tariff. Big companies like Walmart, Target, Tesla, Ford, GM, Stellantis and their customers all face a sharp rise in costs and prices. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when it committed to invest US$500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. It similarly pledged a US$350 billion investment during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. This time the exemption took days to appear, and investors sold Apple shares down heavily as they speculated it would be the most impacted from the tariffs of all the tech heavies. That saw the market value of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms \u2014 slump US$2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2. Trump\u2019s latest move will add to the belief among investors and in bond markets that his administration has injected a permanent sense of uncertainty into US economic policy. Who can plan investment with any certainty when the price of key inputs can double on the whim of an irrational ignoramus? And if the goal of the tariffs remains both to generate massive revenue to fund Trump\u2019s tax cuts and force the onshoring of all manufacturing to the US in a form of modern-day autarky, where will the US get the skilled workers needed, given Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4%? Certainly not migration \u2014 under Trump, the US is now overly hostile to visitors of any kind, let alone people who might want to consider offering their skills to US employers. He also seems to have undermined, at least for the medium term, confidence in the safe haven status of the US and its bonds, which is what caused the initial tariff backflip last week. The Federal Reserve (hated by Trump because of its independence) stepped in on Friday with well-timed comments aimed at bond market investors. Boston Fed president Susan Collins told the Financial Times that the US central bank would \u201cabsolutely be prepared\u201d to deploy its various tools to help stabilise the financial markets if the need arose. You know confidence in US bonds and the country\u2019s credit worthiness is shot when a senior member of the Fed has to go public to emphasise that the central bank will be there to clean up the mess Trump is making. But Treasury yields remained elevated over the weekend at 4.482%, reflecting that Trump\u2019s volatility is materially adding to the risk of what was until recently the crucial safe haven of global finance.

Join Our WhatsApp Channel Business Today Bureau Updated Apr 14, 2025, 10:59 AM IST iPhone maker Foxconn plans to expand in India, create jobs The Uttar Pradesh government is reportedly in talks with iPhone manufacturer Foxconn to set up a new facility in the Greater Noida region. According to sources, UP government officials and representatives of the Taiwanese company have already held two rounds of meetings at Delhi and Lucknow on the proposed project. The new facility is likely to centre around mobile phone manufacturing.

The facility is proposed to be set up on around 300-acres of land. It would be in addition to the 50-acre joint venture project that Foxconn has with HCL for an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facility, sources said. Meanwhile, reports from earlier in the year had indicated that HCL-Foxconn joint venture, which is separate from this new plant, has begun talks with Larsen & Toubro (L&T) as well as Taiwanese major CTCI for the semiconductor assembly and testing (OSAT) facility. The JV is also awaiting Cabinet approval. Foxconn is reportedly investing $37.2 million to hold a 40 per cent stake in the venture. The new facility is expected to create 40,000 jobs and will include residences for all workers inside the complex. Sources added that the UP government was interested in the project as the Noida-Greater Noida region already accounts for nearly 50 per cent of all mobile phone exports from the country. \u201cThere is no better place than UP to have a facility for Apple. Locating it in Noida will add to the ecosystem in the region,\u201d sources added. Foxconn started manufacturing iPhone 15 in its Tamil Nadu facility in Sriperumbudur in 2023. Apple ferried 600 tons of iPhones, or as many as 1.5 million, to the US just after announcements of Trump\u2019s tariffs. The company lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to clear customs at the Chennai airport from 30 hours to six hours.

Cell C is the fourth-largest mobile network operator in South Africa, , after Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom. The company founded in 2001 offers prepaid and postpaid mobile plans, data bundles and internet services, fiber broadband, roaming and international calling, SIM-only plans and device deals. Cell C has confirmed a data breach following a RansomHouse cyberattack that occurred last year. The ransomware group has since leaked the stolen data on its dark web leak site. The gang claimed the theft of 2 TB of data. Compromised data includes full names, contact details, ID numbers, banking information, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical records and passport details. Cell C stated that threat actors gained unauthorized access to some of its IT systems. \u201cCell C is aware that data compromised in the recent cybersecurity incident has been unlawfully disclosed by RansomHouse, the threat actor claiming responsibility.\u201d states the company . \u201cThis follows a previously reported incident involving unauthorised access to unstructured data in some parts of our IT environment.\u201d Cell C has taken swift action to contain a recent cyberattack, secure its systems, and limit the impact. The company engaged top cybersecurity and forensic experts, informed authorities, and is actively supporting affected stakeholders. They continue to monitor for potential data misuse and urge vigilance against fraud, phishing, and identity theft. Cell C has also shared fraud prevention resources, including guidance on registering with SAFPS for extra protection. RansomHouse is a data extortion group that has been active since Dec 2021. Unlike other extortion group, the gang doesn\u2019t encrypt data, but focuses on data theft to speed up its activity. Victims include AMD and Keralty. They shame non-payers by leaking data. Backups are insufficient; IPS is recommended for protection. American hospitals are a privileged target for threat actors due to the huge trove of sensitive data they manage. Ransomware attacks on U.S. healthcare providers surged in 2024, with 98 attacks compromising 117 million records . Hospitals often face system lockdowns, forcing a switch to manual processes. High-profile breaches include Change Healthcare (100M records), Summit Pathology (1.8M), OnePoint Patient Care (796K), and Boston Children\u2019s Health Physicians (909K). In 2023, Loretto Hospital experienced another data security incident . On January 19, 2023, a former employee misappropriated security camera footage of a limited number of patients and posted it on Facebook. The footage was removed after the incident was discovered. Loretto identified the impacted individuals and notified them by mail on March 15, 2023, offering guidance on protecting their information. The exposed information consisted of security camera footage of a small number of patients.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 01:26am EDT Share Save Comment Amazon's new agentic AI system, \"Nova Act,\" is set to transform how we interact with technology in ... More our homes, potentially outperforming competitors from OpenAI and Anthropic. Adobe Stock The next wave of AI transformation will be driven by agents . Rather than simply asking questions or following prompts, these AI tools will carry out complex tasks and act with far more autonomy. This will change a lot of things as we become able to delegate more and more tasks to machines. By connecting with external applications, agents can take care of shopping, scheduling, managing travel, and many of our day-to-day interactions with digital services. Amazon has long been on a mission to bring AI into the home, and the sound of Alexa\u2019s voice is familiar around the world (even if it has been reported that she\u2019s mostly used as a very overpowered timer.) With homes increasingly filled with smart gadgets, agentic AI clearly has the potential to further streamline the way we engage with technology in our homes. However, Amazon\u2019s plans are likely to go further. Here\u2019s what we know about them so far and a look at what it could mean for smart homes of the future. What Is Nova Act? Amazon recently became the latest of the AI giants to unveil their own agentic AI model, called Nova Act. Similar to ChatGPT Operator, it can take control of a web browser and use it to do many of the same things we can do. MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, April 15th WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades On April 14, 2025 Before WrestleMania 41 When you think of how many day-to-day activities we use apps on our phones for, it becomes clear how big the impact of this on our lives could be. According to Amazon, Nova Act is capable of booking trips, completing online purchases and managing calendars and to-do lists. One difference between Nova Act and competing agentic platforms like Operator is that the technology will be built into an upcoming upgrade to Alexa . This could potentially be amazing, with home AI assistants becoming much more useful. Of course, there would be some fairly sturdy privacy guardrails in place for technology like this that could potentially gather very intimate details of our day-to-day lives. According to this TechCrunch report , Nova Act outperforms competitors, including tools from OpenAI and Anthropic, at some of the key tests used to rate agentic AI performance. Agentic AI Assistants Rival agentic services like Operator and Manus may be available (like Nova Act, they are research previews) but don\u2019t have this same potential backdoor into millions of homes. Popular voice assistants brought mainstream adoption for voice-activated computing, but they have been slow to integrate LLM technology of the type used by ChatGPT. After chatting to a voice LLM chatbot like ChatGPT, going back to trying to have a conversational user experience with Alexa (or Siri, or whoever) is frustrating. They\u2019re clearly far less good at holding a conversation or understanding nuanced commands. What they are good at, though, is working with an ecosystem of connected apps and services. By jumping to agentic, Amazon can make home assistants that are capable and conversational like ChatGPT but also have a framework for communicating and controlling external services, as Alexa and Siri can. We\u2019ve recently seen Apple integrate its Apple Intelligence platform into Siri in the hope it will lead to an \"iPhone moment\" for genAI-equipped handsets. Google is taking a slightly different approach, with its Gemini chatbot acting as a standalone voice AI rather than attempting to integrate with the existing Google Assistant. For the moment, at least. So it\u2019s clear that the big AI companies all think the time is right for us to start welcoming the next generation of agentic smart technology into our homes. But would that actually be a smart idea? The Pitfalls Of Agentic AI In The Home Agentic AI has the potential to be hugely transformational. And so there are some pretty big concerns that need to be addressed before we can be confident that society has an informed view of the risks and challenges. These include cybersecurity concerns. Whenever we integrate new technology, particularly into our homes, we need to be sure we aren\u2019t creating new vulnerabilities that can be targeted. Then there's the glaring issue of privacy. Concerns have long existed about how securely smart speakers protect the personal conversations they hear. With autonomous, always-active agents, the risk of privacy invasion becomes even greater. More generally, some people are concerned that becoming too reliant on AI for menial and routine tasks could lead to us becoming over-reliant and helpless, perhaps even to the detriment of human problem-solving or decision-making ability. We should also consider the potential ramifications of AI hallucinations . No one is really sure how the LLM chatbot's propensity to simply make things up will transfer and scale to an agentic, action-based system, but it\u2019s not difficult to predict that things could get messy. At the end of the day, though, I think it\u2019s inevitable that agentic AI will play an increasingly major role in our lives, including in the home. Amazon has as good a shot at making it happen as anyone, thanks to the market penetration of Echo and Alexa. But one thing that\u2019s certain is that with AI, everything is still to play for. In the near future, many more services and devices will offer agentic AI in the home as we start to get a better understanding of what it can do and how it can help us.

Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email He highlighted China's unique advantage in having a large pool of highly skilled workers. When Donald Trump launched his tariff war with China, he expressed hopes for major companies like Apple to manufacture their products in the United States. However, industry experts and critics argued that large-scale manufacturing in America isn't practical due to various reasons. Amid this, an old video of Apple CEO Tim Cook has resurfaced on social media, where he explains why Apple continues to manufacture its products in China. In the video, Mr Cook debunked the common belief that companies flock to China for cheap labour. Instead, he highlighted the importance of China's extensive supply chain, infrastructure, and skilled workforce in supporting Apple's manufacturing needs. Mr Cook said, \"There is confusion about China. And let me at least give you my opinion. The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labour costs. I am not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being a low labour cost country many years ago.\" He further highlighted China's unique advantage in having a large pool of highly skilled workers concentrated in one place. He emphasised that Apple's products require advanced tools and high precision, which China excels in due to its deep tooling expertise. \"The reason is because of the skill, the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill it is. It is like the products we do require really advanced tooling and the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with materials that we do are state-of-the-art,\" he added.

Reacting to the video, one user wrote, \"True, it's about scale, speed, and precision. China has a massive pool of highly skilled tooling and manufacturing engineers. It's not just labor, it's a full ecosystem built over decades, with deep supply chains and rapid turnaround that's hard to replicate elsewhere.\" Another commented, \"Totally agree with Tim. Companies exploited China's cheap labour earlier, but it was China's rapid development of manufacturing tech that took it so ahead of the US and Germany's of the world.\" Notably, Apple relies on the vast manufacturing network in China for the mass production of its iPhone and other devices. In recent times, the company has also shifted its focus to other key markets, including India, to diversify its manufacturing base. India's growing electronics manufacturing ecosystem, coupled with government incentives and a large skilled workforce, makes it an attractive location for Apple to set up production facilities.

First, it has been reported that the Vision Pro 2 is on the way from the Cupertino-based tech giant, which is expected to address latency and compatibility issues. In addition, it is also being reported that a cheaper and lighter version of the Vision Pro is currently in the works. Vision Pro 2 and More Are Coming Soon From Apple Analyst Mark Gurman ( via Bloomberg ) revealed Apple's plans for the future of the Vision Pro lineup. The tech company is said to be now all hands-on deck for its next developments. Two headsets are reportedly in the works that seek to address issues that the original Vision Pro has. First, there will reportedly be a Vision Pro 2 from the company, but it is not what people are expecting. Gurman said that Apple will not jump from the M2 to the M5 but will focus more on offering an ultra-low latency experience that plugs into the Mac in order to access more applications for the headset. On the other hand, there will also reportedly be a cheaper and lighter version of the Vision Pro. Tim Cook Wants to Beat Meta in XR Tech Apart from that, Gurman also revealed that Apple wants to beat Meta at its game, with CEO Tim Cook's intending to develop a pair of AR glasses. This information was reportedly shared by an Apple engineer who claimed that Cook does not care about \"anything else\" other than to develop \"true\" AR glasses with cameras and microphones to gp up against Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses and Project Orion in the future. Apple's Vision Pro The Apple Vision Pro was the talk of the town when Apple first introduced it almost two years ago, centering on a wearable headset packed with significant features. When it was released, the Vision Pro went through the ups and downs as sales faltered after several months, but it still earned accolades along the way, including Popular Science's \" Innovation of the Year .\" Despite its poor performance later on, there is still more to be expected from Apple in their Vision Pro development, with two devices reported to reinforce the lineup . It was previously revealed by Cook that the original Vision Pro was meant for developers, and he defended the original pricing of the headset, saying it was made for those who can afford this early adoption of the device.

This exemption spares U.S. consumers from potential price increases on these widely used products, which are predominantly manufactured in countries like China and India. While this move provides temporary relief for Apple and its customers, it also raises critical questions about the long-term impact of trade policies on global manufacturing strategies and the broader technology sector. The video below from Matt Talks Tech gives us more details about the exemption. Watch this video on YouTube . How Tariff Exemptions Affect Apple and Consumers By excluding Apple products from higher tariffs, the U.S. government has effectively shielded consumers from substantial price hikes. Without this exemption, Apple would likely have passed the increased production costs onto buyers, making its devices significantly more expensive. For example, a high-end iPhone manufactured entirely in the U.S. could cost as much as $3,500, a price point that would render it unaffordable for many consumers. This exemption allows Apple to maintain its current pricing structure, making sure that its devices remain accessible to a broad audience. For consumers, this means continued access to Apple\u2019s products at familiar price points, preserving affordability in a market where rising costs are a constant concern. However, this relief is temporary, as future trade policy changes could still disrupt pricing and availability. Apple\u2019s Global Manufacturing Strategy Apple\u2019s reliance on global manufacturing hubs, particularly in China and India, is a cornerstone of its supply chain. These countries offer access to skilled labor, advanced manufacturing infrastructure, and lower production costs, allowing Apple to produce high-quality devices at competitive prices. While Apple has made investments in U.S.-based facilities, such as its Texas plant for server production and chip-related processes, the company has no immediate plans to shift large-scale iPhone production to the U.S. due to the prohibitive costs involved. This global manufacturing strategy highlights the complexities of balancing cost efficiency with geopolitical and economic pressures. The tariff exemption temporarily alleviates some of these pressures, but it does not resolve the underlying challenges of Apple\u2019s production model. As trade policies evolve, Apple will need to continuously adapt its strategy to maintain its competitive edge while addressing the demands of various stakeholders. Trade Policies and Their Influence on Pricing The tariff exemption underscores the intricate relationship between global trade policies and regional pricing strategies. While U.S. consumers benefit from stable iPhone prices, the situation in other regions remains less predictable. In some markets, Apple may absorb additional costs to maintain competitive pricing, while in others, it might adjust prices upward to offset potential losses caused by tariffs or other economic factors. This uncertainty extends beyond Apple. Competitors like Samsung and Google, which also rely on manufacturing in China, face similar challenges. If tariffs are imposed on their products, they may need to reevaluate their pricing strategies, potentially leading to higher costs for consumers worldwide. This dynamic creates a ripple effect across the consumer electronics market, influencing not only pricing but also innovation and product availability. Competitor Responses and Consumer Implications The tariff exemption for Apple products raises important questions about how competitors will respond. Companies like Samsung and Google, which directly compete with Apple in the smartphone and consumer electronics markets, may be forced to adjust their pricing models if tariffs increase their production costs. This could result in higher prices for a wide range of devices, from smartphones to laptops and wearables. For consumers, the affordability of future devices remains a pressing concern. Speculation about the pricing of upcoming iPhone models, such as the iPhone 17, continues to grow. Many wonder how long Apple can sustain its current pricing structure amid global economic pressures and evolving trade policies. The broader industry faces similar challenges as manufacturers grapple with balancing cost efficiency, competitive pricing, and consumer demand. The Bigger Picture The decision to exempt Apple products from higher tariffs highlights the interconnected nature of trade policies, global manufacturing, and the consumer electronics industry. While U.S. consumers currently benefit from stable prices on Apple devices, the long-term implications for the industry remain uncertain. Companies like Apple must navigate an increasingly complex landscape, balancing production costs, pricing strategies, and consumer affordability to maintain their market positions. As trade policies and economic conditions continue to evolve, the ripple effects will likely shape the future of technology pricing and accessibility worldwide. For now, the exemption provides short-term relief, but it also serves as a reminder of the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead for Apple, its competitors, and the global tech industry.

Social media juggernaut Meta is on trial on Monday. It faces serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission, the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world\u2019s third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\u201d As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \u201cIt would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\u201d Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook\u2019s 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram \u2014 then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. EXPLAINER: Understanding Trump\u2019s tariff policy \u2014 and what it means for Nigeria Ecuador reelects incumbent Daniel Noboa as president How to boost economic growth \u2013 Agbakoba An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram\u2019s emergence as \u201creally scary,\u201d adding that is \u201cwhy we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\u201d The FTC argues Meta\u2019s $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta\u2019s defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta\u2019s apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta\u2019s monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience \u2014 with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. \u2013 Defining the market \u2013 A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta\u2019s market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe bigger that Meta can make the relevant market\u2026 the more likely it is to defeat the FTC\u2019s case,\u201d said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA Pat Leahy Mon Apr 14 2025 - 06:00 The first face-to-face meeting between the EU and the United States since the White House imposed tariffs on imports to the US will take place on Monday when EU trade commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d meets commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and US trade officials in Washington, DC. EU countries including Ireland will be watching anxiously for a sign that substantive negotiations with the US to avoid a damaging trade war can begin soon \u2013 but this weekend senior officials in Dublin and Brussels were hopeful, rather than confident of this. Dublin is especially concerned that pharmaceuticals \u2013 which comprise the great bulk of Irish exports to the US \u2013 should be part of the overall negotiations. The EU and Ireland expect that if pharma exports are part of the broader trade negotiations, they are unlikely to be hit with special tariffs, despite repeated threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on the sector soon.

But Ireland is also wary of an EU response that includes a digital services tax on US tech giants \u2013 a move the Taoiseach told The Irish Times he would oppose and which Minister for Public Expenditure Jack Chambers said on Sunday would signal that \u201cwe\u2019re at a point of enormous damage for the Irish economy\u201d. The unpredictability of the US position was further underlined over the weekend when the Trump administration said that it would exempt smartphones, computers and some other electronic goods from its so-called reciprocal tariffs. The exclusions, published late on Friday by US Customs and Border Protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump\u2019s 125 per cent China tariff and his baseline 10 per cent global tariff on nearly all other countries \u2013 though the White House later indicated that Chinese products would still face an earlier 20 per cent tariff. The announcement came as a relief to Apple , a major Irish taxpayer which manufactures smartphones in China and which saw its share price plummet last week, knocking more than $600 billion (\u20ac528 billion) off the company\u2019s value. However, Mr Lutnick said on Sunday that the exemption was not permanent and such products would be re-examined as part of a government investigation into semiconductors, which face a separate round of tariffs. Senior EU and Irish sources say they hope that Monday\u2019s meeting can lay the groundwork for detailed negotiations between the EU and the US over the coming months. There is hope on the EU side that concessions to the US, such as easing existing tariffs on US cars and undertaking to purchase more American liquefied natural gas, could pave the way for the Trump administration to claim victory and set aside its EU tariffs. But the unpredictability of President Trump makes any expectations about the future unreliable. It is this uncertainty that is spooking global markets, which will be closely watched on Monday morning for signs of a continuing sell-off in US assets, identified by many analysts last week. Some market analysts say the Trump tariffs \u2013 and the increasingly unilateralist position of the US more generally \u2013 is prompting a retreat from US shares and bonds, a trend that could make financing the US government\u2019s huge deficit more difficult. A move away from US assets could also endanger the position of the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency \u2013 a move that would have far-reaching implications for the global financial system. EU foreign affairs ministers, including T\u00e1naiste Simon Harris , are expected to discuss the US tariffs on the margin of a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, though the agenda is dominated by Ukraine and Israel-Palestine.

After days of market mayhem, America\u2019s billionaires finally did something this week that few top bosses have done since Donald Trump took office in January: sound off about the US president\u2019s actions. Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs , they said, were a \u201chuge policy mistake\u201d born of \u201cstupidity\u201d that could spark an \u201ceconomic nuclear winter\u201d and in some cases amounted to \u201cbullshit\u201d. Talk about a gear shift. Until this market-melting moment, companies across the US had shown striking levels of deference to Trump\u2019s agenda. READ MORE We called off our wedding because of Fair Deal threat to my home Big stock gains may signal big trouble The Irish man who bought a home in the US after winning $100,000 on NFL fantasy football Everyone wants a piece of the sport chat action It is hard to say if this will change after his tariff backdown, but what is clear is just how hard it is to deal with an administration bent on upending normal rules of business engagement. To start with, there is simple confusion. Last week I spoke to Nneka Chiazor, head of the Public Affairs Council in Washington, a non-partisan association of public affairs professionals from some of the largest US companies. She had just come back from meeting some of her members in Brussels, who peppered her with questions such as: \u201cCan we still say \u2018green\u2019?\u201d; \u201cIs \u2018clean\u2019 still okay?\u201d; \u201cWould it be okay if we participated in [New York] Climate Week?\u201d \u201cPeople are struggling with how to show respect for the US administration\u201d while honouring their commitments to customers and other stakeholders, she said. That struggle is harder when you see how fraught it can be for companies to do a U-turn on measures they once championed that do not chime with the Trump administration. \u201cEveryone looks completely hypocritical and directionless\u201d, said New York University professor Alison Taylor, author of Higher Ground: How Business Can Do the Right Thing in a Turbulent World. \u201cThat has the impact of making anything that they say look completely implausible, which I don\u2019t think is super smart.\u201d Then there is financial risk. The number of shoppers visiting Target stores has fallen for nine weeks in a row since the retailer triggered a customer boycott with a January statement indicating it was pulling back from diversity initiatives it had long promoted, data from the Placer.ai analytics firm shows. In contrast, footfall has kept growing at Costco, which fought a shareholder proposal aimed at undermining its diversity and inclusion initiatives. Correlation is of course not causation. Many other factors could explain the difference. Target\u2019s trust and likeability score \u2013 a chief measure of reputation \u2013 did drop to a four-year low in the first quarter of this year, reckons market intelligence firm Caliber. But the Caliber surveys this is based on show it continues a downward trend that began years before Target\u2019s diversity retreat. Also, Caliber research on 10 big US companies including Target, Walmart and Apple indicates most had little or no change in their trust scores from the last quarter of 2024, regardless of whether they dropped or defended diversity measures. But employee trust is another matter. Consider the hundreds of associates from some of the world\u2019s largest law firms that have signed an open letter condemning the administration\u2019s targeting of firms it opposes. Imagine how they felt when some of their firms then caved in, pledging millions of dollars in pro bono services to administration-approved causes \u2013 a move that seems to have surprised even the president. Firms are saying \u201cWhere do I sign? Where do I sign?\u201d, Trump marvelled at the White House last month. \u201cNobody can believe it.\u201d Perhaps. History suggests companies are rarely at the vanguard of political resistance, no matter how high the stakes get. Dutch journalist David de Jong says that, in the years of research he did for his 2022 book Nazi Billionaires, he came across just two examples of major industrialists or companies defying Nazi Germany. Robert Bosch, founder of the eponymous engineering and technology group, and steel tycoon Fritz Thyssen. Charles Hecker\u2019s 2024 book Zero Sum offers another lesson about the foreign companies that kept doing business in an increasingly authoritarian Russia. In one telling example, a senior European executive reveals these firms\u2019 corporate headquarters were \u201cwagging their fingers\u201d about Moscow\u2019s illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea, while urging their Russian offices to boost sales next year. The US of 2025 is no Russia of 2014, let alone 1930s Germany. All the same, any US company that bends to an administration uncommonly determined to bring its adversaries to heel is following a familiar path. \u2013 Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Donald Trump United States US tariffs IN THIS SECTION Q&A: How will the Government\u2019s new plan to support businesses affect workers?

Much attention has focused on the mag seven\u2019s growing influence on index returns, given they account for 30 per cent of the S&P 500\u2032s market capitalisation and 17 per cent of the MSCI All-Cap World Index\u2019s (ACWI).

Not only are the mega-caps bigger than most stocks, they\u2019re also more volatile. As a result, the mag seven account for 40-45 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 25 per cent of ACWI volatility. The gap between the volatility contribution and their market-cap weight is now the widest in 25 years. Looking more closely, Verdad\u2019s figures show Tesla has as much impact on US and global index movements as Microsoft , even though Microsoft is more than three times as valuable. However, the main contributor to investor heartburn is Nvidia. Even though it\u2019s less valuable than Apple and Microsoft, it is responsible for 13 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 8 per cent of the ACWI\u2019s \u2013 more than twice as much as Apple and Microsoft.

This includes a couple of highly anticipated features including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as the ability to switch the \u201cIce Cream Truck\u201d sound when driving at low speeds. Latest Proton e.MAS 7 OTA update schedule As shared by Pro-Net product expert David Tiah, Proton e.MAS 7 has recently received an April OTA (Over-the-air) update which adds the Start/Stop charging button on the main central display, optimised braking experience and the ability to view the EV\u2019s location when the car is asleep. For those who are waiting for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, he revealed that Wireless Apple CarPlay is coming in the Q2 Update that\u2019s expected to be pushed by July 2025, while Wired Apple CarPlay is coming in Q3 Update (By October 2025). For Android users, Wired and Wireless Android Auto is expected to arrive in Q4 (by December 2025). Other known usability complaints and feedback are also being addressed as well via OTA. Pro-Net will be giving users to change the AVAS (Ice Cream Truck) sound and bug fixes for Radio scan in the Q2 Update which is expected to be pushed by July. Meanwhile, the permanent speed warning sound memory switch will be added in the Q3 Update which is expected to be pushed by October 2025. As announced earlier , Wireless Apple CarPlay was supposed to be delivered by June. When we asked them about the delay, Pro-Net said they are taking a little bit more time for certification and testing to ensure that the feature works well for all users when it is rolled out. Proton e.MAS app to integrate Shell Recharge chargers very soon At the moment, Proton e.MAS 7 users can experience seamless EV charger discovery, activation and payment directly from the Proton e.MAS app. Through the Proton e.MAS app, users can get access to almost 90% of public chargers in the country from various Charge Point Operators (CPO). As a result, there\u2019s no longer a need to download multiple charging apps from every single CPO. After integrating Charge+ and RExcharge chargers last month, Pro-Net Deputy Head of Charging Ahmad Munif Halim reveals that Shell Recharge will soon be integrated in the app. Tags: Android Auto Apple CarPlay Charge Plus Electric Vehicle EV EV Charger EV charging Pro-Net Proton Proton e.Mas 7 Shell Recharge Alexander Wong POPULAR Proton e.MAS 7: Wireless Apple CarPlay and \u201cIce Cream Truck\u201d sound switch coming in July via OTA Update April 14, 2025 MGS5 EV confirmed for Malaysia: Should BYD, Proton be worried?

In a surprise move, the President\u2019s administration officially announced that Trump exempts smartphones tariffs, including the brutal 125% levy that had companies like Apple and Samsung on edge. According to a notice from US Customs and Border Patrol, these devices are now exempt from Trump\u2019s global 10% tariff and the much bigger China-specific import tax. That\u2019s a big deal. Some early estimates suggested that iPhone prices could have tripled if companies like Apple had passed the extra costs on to consumers. The timing of this exemption feels especially critical. Apple, for one, manufactures about 80% of its iPhones for the US market in China. Without relief, they were looking at an impossible situation: either swallow the cost or jack up prices. It\u2019s the same story for Samsung, which has been trying to diversify its supply chain to avoid over-reliance on China, with India and Vietnam stepping in as alternative hubs. Of course, not every tech product is safe. Game consoles, for example, have already felt the squeeze. Nintendo reportedly delayed Switch 2 pre-orders in the US because of these tariffs. Trump\u2019s tariff policy has been aggressive across the board. He raised China-specific import taxes to 145%, blaming Beijing\u2019s 84% retaliatory tariffs for the hike. The White House is spinning this as a negotiating tactic. Trump claims the endgame is fairer trade, fewer supply chain dependencies, and more factories returning to American soil. Whether or not that works is still up for debate. But for now, with Trump exempts smartphones tariffs, US tech companies\u2014and anyone eyeing a new iPhone\u2014can breathe a little easier.

The article has been amended to reflect the new details. MGS5 EV will be making its way to Malaysia with an estimated price tag that starts at RM115,000 . This was revealed during SAIC Motor Malaysia \u2019s media preview session today, which marked the electric SUV\u2019s first official outing in our market. Expected to be a major rival to current market darlings such as Proton e.MAS 7 and BYD Atto 3 Ultra, the MGS5 EV will be available in Malaysia in two main variants. However, the company did not reveal the specific pricing for each variant, which is something that they are saving for the official launch this May. MGS5 EV Malaysia quick specs Built with a rear-wheel drive setup, the MGS5 EV will be making its way to Malaysia with two battery configurations. The base-spec model is powered by a 49kWh LFP battery, which allows the variant to deliver a WLTP-rated range of 340km alongside a DC charging speed of 120kW. On the other hand, the high-spec MGS5 EV for Malaysia is equipped with a 62.2kWh LFP battery. It also has a much higher WLTP-rated range of 430km and supports a DC charging speed of up to 150kW. For the electric motor though, things are slightly unclear. This is because the presentation slide and press release only mentioned the 125kW (168hp) electric motor which also produces 250Nm of torque. However, the presentation slide during the preview event said that the MGS5 EV has a 0-100km/h timing of 6.1 seconds. This figure did not match the century timing for the 125kW motor which is supposed to be around 8 seconds. The 6.1 seconds 0-100km/h timing is supposed to be for the 180kW (242hp) electric motor as per the one that was fitted to the high-spec MGS5 EV in Thailand. We have reached out to SAIC Motor Malaysia\u2019s representative to obtain further clarifications but were told that more details will only be announced during the public launch this May. Meanwhile, both MGS5 EV variants do share a lot of features with each other. They include the 6.6kW AC charging, Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) capability, a 12.8-inch infotainment display, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless Apple CarPlay & Android Auto, MG Pilot Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), and 7 airbags. The electric SUV also supports the MG iSMART mobile app that allows owners to remotely lock or unlock their car, check its location and charging status, as well as control the climate settings. You can also use the app to transform your phone into a digital key for the EV. At the same time, the high-spec MGS5 EV also has a long list of extra features. Among them include 18-inch alloy wheels, a panoramic sunroof, a powered tailgate, MG perforated pattern on the seats, a heated leather steering wheel, a power-adjustable driver\u2019s seat, 6 premium audio speakers, rear reading lamps, rain-sensing wipers and a 360-degree surround-view camera. In terms of colourways, the MGS5 EV in Malaysia includes Arctic White, Monument Silver, Camden Grey, and Dynamic Red as well as the Elegant Latte which is reserved for the high-spec model. The electric SUV comes standard with a dark interior as well as seats made out of a leather and fabric combination.

Written by Shaurya Tomer , Edited by Siddharth Suvarna | Updated: 14 April 2025 10:06 IST Apple is expected to preview the iPadOS 19 update at WWDC 2025 in June Highlights Apple may bring Mac-like functionality to iPad models with iPadOS 19 It is reported to improve multitasking, productivity and app management iPadOS 19 overhaul is said to be one of the key agendas at WWDC 2025 Advertisement Apple is said to be working on a major overhaul of iPadOS , the operating system (OS) which powers the iPad. According to claims by a seasoned journalist, the Cupertino-based technology giant's next iteration of iPadOS, i PadOS 19 , could make the iPad operating system more like macOS. With several iPad models getting an upgrade to the latest M4 chipset, Apple is reportedly gearing up to focus on delivering more productivity and improving the multitasking capabilities of its tablets. iPadOS 19 Overhaul This information comes from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. In the latest edition of the Power On newsletter , the journalist claims that revamping the iPadOS software will be one of the key agendas during the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) 2025, which kicks off on June 9. With recent upgrades to iPad models, hardware capabilities of the tablets have left behind its software. So far, the iPad OS has been an extension of iOS , offering similar features adapted to a larger screen size. However, users have been asking for more \u2014 more features, more multitasking capabilities, and more productivity. And it seems like Apple will finally listen. As per Gurman, the iPhone maker is aiming to make the iPad operate more like a Mac. Moto Book 60 Laptop, Moto Pad 60 Pro Tablet to Debut on This Date With iPadOS 19, it is said to focus on improving productivity, multitasking and app window management. This report contradicts more context to past information by the same journalist who suggested that Apple's next-generation iPhone, iPad, and Mac OS versions would focus more on delivering visual changes than adding new features. Previous claims by Gurman suggest that the company will minimise the visual differences across devices such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and the Apple Vision Pro and deliver a more cohesive experience. Thus, its operating systems may come with user interface (UI) elements akin to visionOS, the OS powering the spatial headset. While official details remain scarce, one of the rumoured changes is glass effects throughout the UI. Oppo Pad 4 Pro Launched With Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, 12,140mAh Battery Apple's iPad Fold and iPhone Fold Could Launch Next Year As per the journalist, Apple aims to eliminate differences in system actions such as hamburger menus and menu buttons, the menu bar, and button for closing applications. Some applications are suggested to get reworked to aid a new generation of users in better understanding their devices.

Upgrade Now Morning Bid: Doing the tariff two-step German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt \u00b7 Reuters Reuters Sun, Apr 13, 2025, 9:33 PM 3 min read (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole So the \"reciprocal\" tariffs are off smartphones and some electronics, but maybe only for a while as they could get their own special tariff once the White House has completed a study of the global supply chain. Or something. Indeed, Trump on Sunday told reporters tariffs on semiconductors would be announced over the next week and a decision on phones made \"soon\". Essentially more of the same chaos. How anyone running a company can decide on long-term investments in such conditions is a mystery, which has limited the boost to Wall Street futures for the moment. The S&P 500 was up around 0.8% and the Nasdaq 1.2%, though you would have to assume Apple shares, at least, will benefit in the near term. European stock futures have actually performed better, perhaps on speculation that President Trump will blink on other levies, too. Or it could be investors are buying Europe now that U.S. exceptionalism and \"exorbitant privilege\" - the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency - are under such threat. The dollar is certainly feeling unloved, falling back under 143.00 yen and extending last week's 5% slide on the Swiss franc. The euro is knocking on $1.1400 again and even the high-beta Aussie and kiwi are up, a sure sign the dollar's safe-haven status is in jeopardy. Apparently, Japanese officials are gearing up for trade negotiations with the United States that will likely touch on currency policy, with some officials privately bracing for Washington to call on Tokyo to prop up the yen. Should the White House actively start talking the dollar down, it will spook those offshore investors with unhedged positions in U.S. assets - which is most of them. At least Treasuries are steadier, though they show little sign of reversing last week's astonishing 50-basis-point jump in longer-term yields. If sustained, that's a material tightening in financial conditions and a deadweight for the housing market, adding another reason for the Fed to ease even if inflation is heading higher. It will be interesting to see if the New York Fed survey of inflation expectations due later on Monday shows the same kind of spike seen in the University of Michigan numbers. Retail sales data for March on Wednesday could be strong as consumers rushed to buy autos and other goods before the tariffs go into effect. Fed Chair Powell also has a chance to provide his outlook on Wednesday at the Economic Club of Chicago, where the Q&A should be lively. Markets imply a 20% chance of a May rate cut, rising to almost 80% for June. Some 80 basis points of easing are priced in for the year, though that was up around 130 basis points this time last week.

The response has been chaotic. Companies like Framework, which specializes in modular laptops, and Nintendo, with its game consoles, were hit especially hard. Framework had to pause sales of some laptop models in the US . Nintendo also delayed pre-orders of the recently announced Switch 2 , in order to \"assess the potential impact of tariffs.\" As the backlash grew, the Trump administration pulled back slightly by announcing exemptions for key electronics like smartphones, laptops, memory cards, and semiconductors. Now, reports indicate the exemption of smartphones, laptops, and other electronics will be short-lived. CNN highlighted comments made by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick during an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week, where he stated that the exemptions will be short-lived, with new tariffs targeting electronics already in the works.

Hours later, Trump made a post on Truth Social , where he claimed that no such exemptions exist, as products like smartphones and laptops remain subject to existing tariffs, specifically the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs. NOBODY is getting \u201coff the hook\u201d for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst! There was no Tariff \u201cexception\u201d announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u201cbucket.\u201d The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us. The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The Trump administration hopes that the tariffs will make the US less reliant on countries like China in terms of manufacturing . Industry executives like Apple CEO Tim Cook have reiterated that manufacturing in China is not because of cheap labour, but due to a shortage of skilled labour elsewhere, a sentiment that Elon Musk also shares.

SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. Reuters TSMC , the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is set to report a 54% leap in first-quarter profit on Thursday, though is also likely to flag risk from trade policies of U.S. President Donald Trump. The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a trend towards implementing AI features in online products. But the firm faces headwind not just from Trump's import tariffs but also his criticism of Taiwan's dominance of the chip industry. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is set to report net profit of T$347.8 billion ($10.74 billion) for the three months through March 31, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 17 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. That estimate compares to the 2024 first-quarter net profit of T$225.5 billion. TSMC has been spending billions of dollars on new factories overseas, though it said most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan. It announced a $100 billion investment with Trump at the White House last month, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona. Live Events Trump has both praised Taiwan's chip industry and threatened it with tariffs. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories Last week, he said he had told TSMC it would have to pay a tax of up to 100% if it did not build factories in the U.S. On Sunday, he said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from tariffs on China will be short-lived, pledging a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector. \"The company will likely double down on overseas fab investments to mitigate the geopolitical risk, despite two to three percentage points of gross margin dilution for the next five years,\" said SemiAnalysis analyst Sravan Kundojjala. \"This will likely ensure TSMC gets favourable treatment from the U.S. government and minimise the tariff burden.\" Apple's iPhones, given they are mainly made in China, is another risk area for TSMC, said Cathay Futures analyst Venson Tsai. \"If the iPhone can't be sold, then TSMC's chips can't either,\" Tsai said. TSMC last week reported a surge in first-quarter revenue in Taiwan dollars, slightly ahead of market expectations. The company gives its revenue outlook in U.S. dollars on its quarterly earnings call, scheduled for 0600 GMT on Thursday. It will also update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including planned capital expenditure for production increases. On its last earnings call in January, TSMC said it expected capital spending this year to be $38 billion to $42 billion, an increase of as much as 41% from last year.

See full bio Edward Moyer April 12, 2025 12:49 p.m. PT 2 min read James Martin/CNET Another twist in the tariff saga: Smartphones , laptops and other consumer electronics may not see soaring prices due to tariffs after all, at least for the time being. Late Friday, the Trump administration exempted such products from the reciprocal tariffs it had imposed earlier, including the 125% fees levied on imports from China, where many tech and electronics products are manufactured. A notice to shippers posted late Friday by US Customs and Border Protection included a list of tariff codes for product categories that won't be subject to the fees. Code 8471 covers computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing, Reuters reported . Flat panel displays, memory chips and semiconductors will also sidestep the tariff fees, the news outlet said. Industry observers had feared massive price hikes on tech and other gear as a result of tariffs, and concerns had prompted some consumers to rush to buy iPhones and other products. Apple Store employees saw an uptick in foot traffic last weekend, with one worker telling Bloomberg that the surge felt like the holiday shopping season. It's unclear whether the exemption will stay in place, however, with both Bloomberg and The New York Times reporting that different tariff fees may end up affecting electronics equipment down the line. What this means for you If your head's spinning over all the back-and-forth tariff developments, you're definitely not alone. What does it mean for the prices you'll see when crossing things off your shopping list? The short answer is: Don't be surprised if you wind up paying more for at least some goods and services. For details, you can check out our Tariffs Explained piece. And before this latest news, we asked CNET experts to give us their best predictions and advice when it comes to shopping for tech products like laptops, phones, TVs and more. See their responses in our Buy or Wait guide. Although a CNET survey showed that some people are rushing to buy tech gear before anticipated price rises, experts caution against busting out the credit card. If you already had your eye on a particular product and you'd set aside the money for it, buying now, or during an upcoming sale, could help you save money. It could also help you breathe a little easier. But again, be wary of taking on debt. Find out more here .

It doesn't have a great app to go alongside it; it's not the most powerful power station, and it's not the sleekest, but the one thing this power station has is the ease of charging.

I've got countless memories of grabbing some Duracell batteries to throw in toys, remotes, and other tools growing up, all the way up to toys for my kids. Duracell is a well-known, highly-reputable company that people recognize and trust. Having reviewed the best portable power stations , I can confidently say this one is meant for everyday use, has excellent ports, and is a simple backup for essentials. However, what sets this power station apart is not the bold design, port offering, power output, or capacity. What sets this apart is that you can recharge it with a standard AC extension cord. There is no fancy proprietary charger or IEC cable that swears on the cable that you can only use for that power station. Any AC extension cable will do.

They offer a smaller variant, but if you're going with this company, I'd choose this larger one for portable power stations. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) Duracell G800: Unboxing & first impressions When I first found the Duracell G800, I thought it was a gimmick. A power station resembling a famous battery wouldn't work well. But, once I got it, I was proven wrong. The build quality is excellent, the packaging is professional and straightforward, the handle is comfortable to carry, the port offering is fantastic, and then I noticed the way to charge, and I realized this is working hard to compete right out of the gate. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) Duracell G800: Design & build quality Specs Battery Capacity: 620Wh Output: 800W (shared across 3 AC ports) Ports: \u2022 3x AC Outlets (total 800W shared) \u2022 3x USB-A (7.2A shared) \u2022 2x USB-C (100W per port, 200W total) \u2022 1x Car charger port (120W max) Weight: 19.4 lbs Dimensions: 12.5\u201d x 8.3\u201d x 11.5\u201d The Duracell G800 is a unique look. It's got a bronze top half to resemble the famous battery, but what's great is that Duracell chose to make the line between the black and copper a ring light, helping light whatever you may be trying to plug in, in the dark, without power, thus the need for a power station. Further, the handle is solid and firm, and there is some integrated storage on the backside of the power station to help carry the power cable or any USB-C/USB-A cables. Thankfully, all the main ports are on the front, which I appreciate. It makes for a portable power station that is easy to use, allowing for this to be set down and forgotten about while charging whatever you may be keeping charged. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) Duracell G800: In use Admittedly, I've had this G800 for around 160 days. However, in that time, I've had my team put this thing to the test in real-life scenarios. I've had this power station help out when charging cameras on the go out of the back of my Jeep, charging iPads and computers on a long trip, and being a light source and emergency power in a power outage. I've had this power station help out my family in Florida during the crazy hurricanes this last year. In all the scenarios, this power station functioned great. The handle makes it easy to maneuver in all of these environments, and the forward-facing ports mean that all ports are accessible simultaneously. Throughout my time testing, the most standout feature is that this unit recharges with a standard AC extension cord outlet. One thing that makes a power station less usable is when it has a proprietary charger or a unique charger that works only for that unit. It makes recharging more cumbersome, more challenging in many ways, and more expensive if you ever damage or misplace your charger. With Duracell, they chose to go the opposite route of an Apple with the (late) Lightning cable, and they decided to go with a cable option that is nearly everywhere (in the US). This may be an intentional move, or it's beginner's luck; regardless, I am a fan. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) While testing, I got this power station recharged to an impressive 80 percent in about an hour, just as Duracell suggests. I got my 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro fully recharged about 8.5 times, depending on just how heavily I ran it when plugged in (I run my computers hard with all that I do in a day). Duracell promotes being able to run a Wi-Fi router for around 26 hours, a TV (very generic) for 5 hours, a mini cooler for 22 hours, a drone for 26 charges, and lights for 6.7 hours. If you want to extend your off-grid power, plug in a G-Solar Panel to recharge the power station directly from the sun.

Sadly, it does not have app control, but it does have nice features such as a built-in light ring and that handy ability to recharge with a simple standard AC extension cord.

Marathon Closed Alpha Begins In April, Here's How To Sign Up Want to try the next game from Halo and Destiny developer Bungie? Now's your chance. By Eddie Makuch on April 12, 2025 at 11:00AM PDT 2 Comments Where to buy Marathon There are currently no available deals GameSpot may get a commission from retail offers. As part of the Bungie's reveal showcase for its next game, Marathon, the studio announced a closed alpha test and confirmed how players can sign up for access. The Marathon closed alpha starts later this month, and players can join the Marathon Discord channel for a chance to get in. Bungie said its teams will be \"actively engaging\" with the Discord channel, including conducting live Q&As and generally discussing the project directly with fans. Marathon is a team-based extraction shooter. It's a successor of sorts to Bungie's 1994 game of the same name. Whereas Bungie today is better known for its work on the Destiny and Halo franchises, the original Marathon was one of Bungie's first big successes when it was released for Mac and Apple Pippin. Marathon 2: Durandal followed in 1995, with Marathon Infinity coming in 1996. It wasn't until 2001 that Bungie truly broke out in a major way with the debut of Halo: Combat Evolved. Sony now owns Bungie, but the new Marathon is in the works for platforms beyond the PS5 alone, including Xbox Series X|S and PC--cross-play is supported across all platforms. Marathon will mark Bungie's first big new release since Sony acquired the company in 2022. Marathon launches on September 23 , the same day as Borderlands 4.

TV presenter and author Ali Mau, who has written her memoir titled No Words for This. Photo / Dean Purcell Warning: This episode contains discussion about sexual abuse Broadcaster and author Ali Mau feels that people shouldn\u2019t be shocked by revelations she experienced sexual assault as a child. The former TV presenter has shared her life story in her memoir, No Words for This , published last month. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. In it, she details publicly for the first time the sexual assault she experienced from her father, who also abused her sister and nephew. Speaking to Paula Bennett on her NZ Herald podcast Ask Me Anything , Mau said a lot of people have told her they are surprised by her story, but she doesn\u2019t think they should feel that way as it is \u201cso common\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ll have heard that statistic, one in three women, one in seven men experience sexual harm in their lifetime \u2013 and these are official police figures. \u201c[That\u2019s] 930,000 New Zealanders have experienced, not necessarily exactly what I experienced, but some kind of sexual harm in their lifetime. It\u2019s almost a million people. \u201cSo the surprising thing is not that it happened at all. The surprise comes from the fact that we don\u2019t talk about it enough. It is, I believe, the last big taboo subject in our society. And it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Advertisement Advertise with NZME. She said that is why she wrote the book, because these conversations need to be had and should be had. \u201cIf you think 10 or 15 years ago, we were, as a society, not able to talk about domestic violence. And then a bunch of incredibly committed women have worked over that time to change that around completely and make it a national conversation that we can have to the point where one of the biggest retailers in the country sponsors women\u2019s refuge. \u201cI believe we can do that with sexual harm as well.\u201d Mau has spoken to hundreds of sexual harm survivors, men and women, and said they often speak of a level of shame or self-blame. She said she was able to apply that to herself when telling her story. Mau is now working on a charity, Tika, to help victims get legal support. She is launching it with barrister Zoe Lorton and it is a concept they have been working on since 2018. When they started exploring the issue, they found that only 7% of sexual harm victims report their case, and the figure had not changed in a decade. \" I naively had assumed that all the awareness-raising would move the needle on that, and it hadn\u2019t.\" Tika, when it launches later this year, is an online platform that will allow victims to input details about their perpetrator and get connected with a lawyer to find out what their legal route forwards is. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. \" It\u2019s a game changer. Do you know that you cannot, even at this point, report sexual harm online? You have to walk into a police station or phone and speak to a uniformed officer at the front desk. \u201cWhen you think about the generations of my children\u2019s age and younger, they do everything on their phone. \u201cSo being able to offer a secure platform that they can trust, that will tell them whether anybody else has been harmed by the same person, even just that step is incredibly powerful for somebody who\u2019s been unsure about what to do, but in the back of their mind, they know they\u2019re looking for some kind of accountability and justice.\u201d Listen to the full episode for more from Ali Mau about sharing her story and how she wants to help victims, as well as reflections on her broadcasting career, her public relationship and subsequent divorce from Simon Dallow, and how it felt to be outed.

Inconsistencies may occur. \u2716 President Donald Trump 's decision to exempt many electronics from newly implemented tariffs has sparked surprise from critics, with some citing recent remarks by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to quip about the latest scaling back of the controversial economic policy. Newsweek reached out to the White House and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for comment on Saturday. Why It Matters Earlier this week, Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs went into effect for several hours before he paused most of them for 90 days\u2014with the notable exception of China. The United States and China remain in a tit-for-tat trade war, with Trump hiking the 104 percent tariffs on China to 125 percent on Wednesday after Beijing hit back at the U.S. with an 84 percent additional levy earlier in the day. Trump's total tariffs now stand at 145 percent on Chinese goods, while China has imposed a 125 percent tariff, dismissing Trump's strategy as \"a joke.\" As recently as last Sunday, Lutnick said that tariffs would allow smartphone manufacturing to happen in the U.S., instead of abroad. But the Friday announcement of the electronics exemption suggests manufactures will no longer have the immediate incentive to consider producing smartphones and other electronics in the U.S. What to Know A Friday evening update from CBP exempted smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts from the tariffs. The decision was retroactive to as early as April 5. The exemption list includes products the U.S. heavily relies on for overseas production, with limited domestic manufacturing capacity and high consumer demand. Companies such as Apple , which carries out 90 percent of its iPhone manufacturing in China, are set to benefit from the exemptions. \"Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday,\" analysts at Wedbush said in a statement, CNN reported. \"A big step forward for US tech to get these exemptions and the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend.\" While tech companies may be breathing a sigh of relief, some critics of Trump's tariffs took to X, formerly Twitter , on Saturday to joke about the decision and remind their followers of the administration's own words regarding the tariffs.

Trump literally said there would be 'no exemptions' to his reciprocal tariffs (see video) and MAGA cheered. 'No, with reciprocal [tariffs] you don't need to,' he said. Now, suddenly he's backtracking again and adding a bunch of exemptions to his reciprocal tariffs. And MAGA is cheering yet again. It's almost as if he has no idea what he's doing and MAGA doesn't stand for anything except whatever Trump says and does.\" Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman and prominent Trump critic, wrote on X: \"More exemptions, so the question remains: If tariffs are so great, why so many exemptions?\" MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle on X: \"So these exemptions on electronics from China... Is this how we should see it? 'We are imposing a 145% tariff on all Chinese goods -except what we buy.'\" Keith Olbermann, a political commentator, on X: \"Trump: Tariffs are perfect and beautiful and mandatory and I won't back down. Also Trump: here are 37,498 tariff exemptions for companies who've greased me.\" Tahra Jirari, director of economic analyst at Progress Chamber, on X: \"Incredible. Someone check on Lutnick, I know he wanted us screwing millions of smartphones.\" Sar Haribhakti, who leads global product communications at Stripe, on X: \"Five days ago: Lutnick: 'The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones\u2014that kind of thing is going to come to America.' Last night:\" Haribhakti reposted the news about the tariff exemptions on electronics. Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, on X : \"More caving (thank goodness). What is the strategy here? President Donald Trump's administration exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs, potentially cushioning consumers from sticker shock.\" President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 10 in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 10 in Washington, D.C. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images What Officials Are Saying Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to CBS News' Face the Nation last Sunday: \"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones\u2014that kind of thing is going to come to America.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a Saturday statement: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.\" President Donald Trump, in a Wednesday post on Truth Social: \"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.\" China's Finance Ministry, in a statement: \"The U.S. escalation of tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China's legitimate rights and interests and seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system.\" What Happens Next? The exemptions are already in effect. Tensions between Washington and Beijing remain high, with no sign that other tariffs will be reduced anytime soon. Many other nations are reportedly in the process of negotiating with the Trump administration during the ongoing 90-day pause announced this week. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

Todd is the guest on this week\u2019s edition of Mediaite\u2019s new Press Club podcast , hosted by Aidan McLaughlin , to discuss the media, the news of the day, and life after NBC News, which he left in January after nearly two decades. In the episode, now out on YouTube and podcast platforms, McLaughlin asked Todd about Trump\u2019s tariffs and the resulting stock market roller coaster this week: AIDAN MCLAUGHLIN: Trump finally consummated his decades-long flirtation with tariffs. Have you looked at your portfolio this week? CHUCK TODD: I\u2019m over 50, I\u2019m having to look at it every hour. No, I mean, and that\u2019s this, that\u2019s the dirty little, you know what I took his biggest political problem, is that when you\u2019re of a certain age, you start looking at this every day. You know, this whole, \u201cwell people don\u2019t look at the stock market every day.\u201d. Yeah, but the people who are most likely to vote in midterms, they do. They pay attention to if the Social Security office is taking their phone calls. Like, he is rattling constituencies that are the ones that are most likely to show up to vote. Right? So it\u2019s just one of those, you\u2019re like, this is why this could be politically catastrophic. AIDAN MCLAUGHLIN: So yeah, so we\u2019re in very much uncharted territory right now. CHUCK TODD: And then some. Todd went on to explain why the chaotic tariff roll-out could be Trump\u2019s \u201cAfghanistan moment\u201d \u2014 a reference to the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that led to a collapse of former President Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings, a collapse he never recovered from. He explained: Afghanistan became a competency question. And I think this tariff business for Trump becomes a competency question. \u2018Wait a minute, you went about this all wrong and you caused an economic tsunami. We agree we needed to do it, but you don\u2019t know how to do.\u2019 And in some ways, competency is actually more lethal here than the ideological distinction between the two. And this is why I think he\u2019s probably never going to be over \u2014 barring some we don\u2019t know, rallying around the president because we\u2019re in war or something like this \u2014 I don\u2019t if he ever gets over 45 [percent approval rating] again.

It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia. US Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145 per cent tariffs levied on China or the 10 per cent baseline tariffs elsewhere. It\u2019s the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. The goal is to encourage more domestic manufacturing. But the exemptions seem to acknowledge that the current electronics supply chain is virtually all in Asia and it will be challenging to shift that to the US. For example, about 90 per cent of iPhones are produced and assembled in China, according to Wedbush Securities. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing US Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Trump previously said he would consider exempting some companies from tariffs. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment early Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Reuters reports that the company, which makes phone cases, power banks, adapters, cables, and more, raised prices on a fifth of its products since Thursday. The move comes as the company passes the cost of US tariffs onto its US-based customers. Some 127 Anker products have seen an average increase of 18% since Thursday last week, with the majority of those occurring after Monday, April 7, when U.S. President Donald Trump added an extra 50% import duty on Chinese goods, according to data from e-commerce services provider SmartScout. Reuters notes that, on an investor call earlier in the week, Anker had said that it was able to raise prices \u201cas it had bargaining power and because its rivals were mainly Chinese and under similar tariff pressure, but did not provide specifics.\u201d Ultimately, more companies could well choose to follow suit. Tariffs make it more costly for companies to bring goods from specific countries into the United States. One way that those companies can negate the additional costs while protecting their profits is to increase prices, effectively passing the cost of the tariffs onto customers. The result is that US-based customers pay more for products as a result of the tariffs that were imposed by its leaders.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

While President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would delay many of the market-shaking tariffs that he\u2019d announced the previous week, he kept a universal baseline 10% tariff in place, while also increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% (on top of a 20% tariff that he\u2019d already imposed on goods from China). There\u2019s been plenty of speculation about what the tariffs will mean for the tech industry , which manufactures many consumer electronics in China and elsewhere abroad. One of Trump\u2019s stated goals is to bring manufacturing back to the United States, but others believe the dream of an American-made iPhone is a fantasy . Those debates may be paused after Friday evening, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection posted a list of product categories that are \u201cexcluded from the reciprocal tariffs imposed under Executive Order 14257,\u201d with the exclusions backdated to April 5. Those categories appear to include smartphones, laptops, hard drives, and semiconductors. Those products will all be exempt from both the 125% tariff on goods from China, as well as the universal baseline tariff. (Other tariffs, such as the previous 20% tariff on Chinese goods, would presumably still apply.) Notable Silicon Valley figures led by Elon Musk have joined the Trump administration, while other tech CEOs have been courting Trump, most visibly with millions of dollars donated to his inauguration. Those efforts seemed to bear little fruit \u2014 until last night\u2019s announcement, which Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, described as \u201ca dream scenario for tech investors.\u201d Tech giants like Apple and Nvidia are likely celebrating the news, as are U.S. consumers who will avoid a big markup on their next iPhone. But the industry could still be hit with more targeted tariffs and other restrictions. For example, The New York Times reports that the Trump administration is preparing a national security-related investigation into semiconductors. And indeed, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that these products would be included in \u201cthe semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two.\u201d This post has been updated with Howard Lutnick\u2019s comments about the tariffs.

Mythic Quest, the Apple TV Plus comedy about a game studio, isn\u2019t getting a fifth season, reports Variety . And, like a developer issuing a farewell patch, Apple is updating the final episode of season four with a new \u201cgoodbye\u201d ending next week. Variety published a statement from Mythic Quest \u2019s executive producers: \u201cEndings are hard. But after four incredible seasons, \u2018Mythic Quest\u2019 is coming to a close,\u201d said series executive producers Megan Ganz, David Hornsby, and Rob McElhenney. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud of the show and the world we got to build\u2014and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it. To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Apple\u2019s blessing we made one final update to our last episode\u2014so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.\u201d The news comes just weeks after a report that Apple has been losing $1 billion a year on TV Plus. The show just wrapped up its fourth season and released a f our-episode spinoff called Side Quest on March 26th. One of the early Apple TV Plus shows, Mythic Quest tells the story of Mythic Quest Studios, a fictional games studio led by Ian Grimm, Rob McElhenney\u2019s parody of a visionary tech founder bro, and Charlotte Nicdao\u2019s Poppy Li, an awkward but brilliant engineer who serves as his co-creative director. Throughout the series, Mythic Quest sent up the tech industry, from lampooning startup culture to raising some of the gaming world\u2019s darker ethical questions . But to echo an early Verge write-up of Mythic Quest , you don\u2019t need to understand any of that to enjoy the show. Mythic Quest also stars David Hornsby, Ashly Burch, Imani Hakim, Danny Pudi, Jessie Ennis, Naomi Ekperigin, Andrew Friedman, and Michael Naughton.

See Full Bio MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle (MSNBC screenshot) MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle appeared with her old hosting partner Ali Velshi on Saturday morning to weigh in on a major announcement from Donald Trump's administration on Chinese imports. In a bulletin posted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection late Friday, the administration announced smartphones, computers, and assorted electronics would be exempt from the ruinous 145% percent tariffs imposed on other Chinese products. As Ruhle, a former hedge fund trader put it, \"This is huge.\" Speaking with Velshi, she elaborated, \"So just imagine all the big electronics that we get that's manufactured in China , right? Chips, semiconductors, TVs, cell phones \u2013\u2013 all the big electronics out there are now going to be tariff-free. I mean, Ali, this is extraordinary.\" \"It's kind of like saying we're going to impose 100 plus percent tariffs on everything we buy from China, except for what we actually buy from them,\" she dryly quipped. \"It's sort of crazy because we haven't even started negotiating, you know, this trade war and already we're making this announcement.\" \"It's mind-blowing i n that in the last week what have we done,\" she added. \"The president announced the moves on tariff, we saw the stock market crater, we saw the bond market get whacked, which is the most concerning because it means people don't have faith in the U.S.\". \"We saw consumer confidence absolutely crater and businesses big and small fall into an absolute panic, given what an enormous trading partner China is, but also countries around the world, but focusing just on china, man, if you are [ Apple head] Tim Cook or the other big tech CEO's who gave big and went to Trump's inauguration, you are glad you did that,\" she observed.

A flexible drain snake that'll get out all those clumps of hair and gunk so the bathtub stops filling up past your ankles every time you shower. Just stick it down the drain, twist it, and the ridges at the end will catch all the goop, making sure it all comes out. Amazon, www.amazon.com This pack contains a reusable handle and five single-use heads that you just remove and dispose of after handling your clogged pipes. Promising review: \"Wow. Best thing ever. Seriously. I have had tweezers and sticks and plumbers and chemicals trying to get my master sink to drain. Plumber even said I need an entirely new faucet to get the drain plug part because they don't sell those separately. Well, I have two sinks, a tub, and shower that all match so that was not a valid solution. Doubt I can find the same model. So I bought this thing, stuffed it down, and pulled up hair and black muck. Did it about eight times quickly, ran the water, went right down the drain. Seriously. This is the best tool ever and the best $20 I have ever spent. Everyone with a sink needs this tool. Seriously.\" \u2014 juliejules Get a five-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in other sets and styles). 2. A pack of 120 retainer cleaner tablets because it turns out your Invisalign is supposed to be ~clear~ (it also works on mouthguards and dentures!). All you do is drop a tablet into warm tap water, let your dental device soak for a few minutes, and voila! \u2014 it'll kill bacteria and remove the buildup that's causing discoloration and unpleasant odors. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I really loved this product. I am currently waiting for a new Invisalign set. My old Invisalign needed to be cleaned. I read the reviews and decided to purchase. OMG, it worked! They had a fresh taste and were clean. I wish I had found this product sooner. I did let them soak overnight only because I had been wearing them for the last four months. Nothing happened to Invisalign; there was no weakness or anything. Just very clean and fresh. If I could have given the product 10 stars, I would have. \" \u2014 Lisa R. Get 120 tablets from Amazon for $18.81 (available in five pack sizes). 3. A new pair of workout leggings to replace the super pilled ones you wear three times a week. They're made with a thick, buttery soft fabric (no one is seeing those hot pink undies) and have ~pockets~ so you don't have to carry your phone around the gym. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"THESE...are the best leggings I have ever worn in my entire life! They are so smooth and comfortable. Soft as butter. They fit perfectly. It almost feels like you're naked but they feel somehow insulated and cozy. Stretchy and made of amazingly durable quality. I need to get more colors!\" \u2014 Alexandra Shick Get them from Amazon for $24.98 (available in women's sizes XS\u2013XXL, in three inseam lengths, and 45 colors). 4. A pack of AirPods cleaning putty because it's so embarrassing when you want to share earbuds with someone, but yours are coated in wax and dust. Plus, it's soooo satisfying to squish the lil' square into your speaker and see all the gunk it pulls out \u2014 and then you get to enjoy clearer, louder-sounding music! www.amazon.com Before you toss your tech in the trash, at least give this a try. Promising review: \"I never usually write reviews but this is an exception. I've had my AirPods for over a year and when the sound quality was diminishing, I was afraid they had a short life expectancy and I would need to get a new pair! Even after using cotton buds to clean the AirPods out, I thought that was enough until my friend said there's stuff built up and hard to see, but there was nothing able to get it out! Enter this product. It literally took five minutes to clean each ear bud effectively and instantly the sound quality was as good as new! Loud, clear, less trouble connecting to my phone, etc. You don't need a full square to clean them, so you can pull a piece off or reuse a square with a side you haven't used! SO happy I found a solution!\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get 24 squares from Amazon for $15.99 (available in two pack sizes). 5. A veggie chopper for keeping your counter tidy while speeding up your prep time. If you love to cook but hate chopping (who doesn\u2019t, right?), this thing is a lifesaver. It chops just about everything \u2014 onions, peppers, zucchinis, potatoes, you name it! Plus, it comes with different blades for slicing, dicing, and even spiraling your favorite veggies. www.amazon.com , Amazon Check out a TikTok of the veggie chopper in action. Promising review: \"If you cook, you need this product! I have had this chopper since 2018 and it is by far my favorite kitchen purchase. I have used it hundreds of times over the years and it has held up great. I just bought my MIL one for Christmas and she already loves how much easier it has made meal prep . It is well made and I like that there are different attachments and sizes. I would recommend this chopper!\" \u2014 Steph Get it from Amazon for $23.99+ (available in five colors and five sets). 6. A pack of two antimicrobial \"flossing toothbrushes\" because your current one looks like it was used to scrub the bathroom floor (no offense). This has dual-layered bristles: regular ones and ultra-long, thin flossing bristles that get *deep* in between your teeth and gums. Reviewers are saying it feels like they got their teeth cleaned at the dentist, but nope! \u2014 just this very innovative toothbrush. Emma Lord / BuzzFeed Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, specializing in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed for deeper cleans. Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord has to say: \"I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.\" Promising review: \"I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth \u2014 it definitely gets between the teeth and also, more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck, and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!\" \u2014 Jason A. Get a pair from Amazon for $9.99 . 7. A WD-40 pen if your squeaky cabinets are driving you up the wall. It's way less messy than traditional spray methods, and reviewers love the precision this pen offers \u2014 perfect for getting into tight spaces and silencing those squeaks once and for all. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I love WD-40 products and use them for everything. I spray on shovels to keep dirt or snow from sticking, spray around windows and thresholds to deter bugs, clean Sharpies off wood and walls, and, of course, stop squeaky doors. These small direct-point application pens are great. Keep one in the glove box, my kitchen 'junk' drawer, and the house toolbox.\" \u2014 BBP623 Get a three-pack from Amazon for $12.99 . 8. A wall-mounted organizer to handle those annoying brooms, mops, rakes, and shovels that are always falling over.

Promising review: \"Perfect! Exactly what I needed to organize my mop, broom, scoop, etc. Efficient and easy to use. A little hard to get my scoop into it, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s thicker than the rest of the items. Love that there are hooks. Spray bottles and cleaning product bottles hang perfectly on there too.\" \u2014 Kavita Chandanie Get it from Amazon for $13.99 (available in two sizes and two colors). 9. A set of double-sided shower rings that make changing your shower curtain or liner easier than it's ever been. Since you hang the curtain on one side and the liner on the other, you'll avoid the hassle of taking the whole thing down every time you switch the curtain/liner. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This is one of those items you didn\u2019t know you needed, and once you get it, you can\u2019t help but wonder how you ever managed before. I absolutely hate taking the shower curtains off because of the whole open and close for several shower curtains. I know you\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s just shower curtain hooks.\u2019 And it is. But when you have to change out the creepy shower liner that likes to attack you, and you dread doing so, this just adds seconds to your life. No more unsnapping. Simply take out the liner, place the liner on the appropriate hook, and presto.\" \u2014 Nardsbaby Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in 18 colors). 10.

Promising review: \"I have had chronic issues with pain caused by severely knotted muscles. This massager changed my life! I have tried muscle relaxers, stretching, and many other things, but a couple of muscles in my upper back would just knot up with any stress, physical or emotional, and the pain was nearly constant. I used this for about a half hour on all of my muscles with the first use, and the effects were immediate and profound. Pain relief was instant , and occasional use for a couple of minutes to the affected areas has been able to maintain that relief. I loved it so much that I bought one for my brother, who says it is helping him tremendously, as well. I have charged my massager twice in the last two months, battery life is excellent!\" \u2014 Patty S. Get it from Amazon for $89.99 (available in seven colors). 11. A Squatty Potty that elevates your feet to help mimic a natural squatting position for easier, more complete bowel movements. Just because it helps your trips to the bathroom be quicker doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still enjoy some quality TikTok scrolling time while you\u2019re in there! Amazon, www.amazon.com I have one and it has truly made that aspect of life (\ud83d\udebd) soooo much easier! The only downside is that public restrooms don't have these and I kind of can't go without it lol.

And if you want more Squatty Potty content before making this life-changing purchase, check out our Squatty Potty review ! Promising review: \"I'll do you all the courtesy of NOT adding a photo or video (You're welcome). This works. Whoever invented the toilet had their heart in the right place, but not their knees.

Promising review: \"I love these knives! I\u2019ve had them for a year now and I haven\u2019t had to sharpen them. Good grip, durable, and easy to handle. I hand wash them because we don\u2019t have a dishwasher but they\u2019re very easy to clean. I love the blade covers. It makes them safe for putting them in a drawer. I love not having a big knife block on my counter. Lightweight. They have not rusted.\" \u2014 Nvs Get the 12-piece set from Amazon for $18.99 (also available in a 10-piece set). 15. A spice drawer organizer so you can finally have the neatly arranged, easy-to-find collection of spices you've always wanted.

It's basically like skincare for your driveway! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"The scene: me with a hot glove carrying a drip pan full of au jus. Thumb goes into hot liquid. Pan is dropped, and greasy meat juice is all over our patio brick. In freezing temps. I use a putty knife to get some out, but there the stain remains six months later. Even muriatic acid didn\u2019t cut it. Ordered this. Tried a spot. Let it dry overnight. Swept it. Stain is almost gone. I apply it to the rest of the stain and let it set. But this time it rains and turns it gooey. Fortunately, new power washer and I join forces with Chomp, and within a half hour, it\u2019s totally gone. Amazing product. 1,000% satisfied. \" \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (available in two sizes). 17. A set of gold cable organizers you can stick to your desk or nightstand to hold those cords that are always falling to the ground or getting tangled.

Brighttia / Etsy Brighttia is a New York-based Etsy shop established in 2018 that specializes in industrial and modern interior lighting and decor. Promising review: \"These brass cable organizers are beautiful and high quality. I\u2019m using two of them to keep a plug-in sconce cord attached to the wall and to direct the cord to the electrical outlet. These little gold pieces add a touch of functionality and glamour to the sconces. Exactly what I was looking for.\" \u2014 Amy Margolis Get a set of four from Brighttia on Etsy for $22.98 (available in 12 colors). 18. A dishwasher magnet so everyone in the house knows NOT to put their dirty spoon in with the freshly cleaned silverware. Sometimes it's too hard to tell whether the dishwasher needs to be run or unloaded, and this just clears up all the confusion. Sally Elshorafa / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"What took them so long?? Every household should have one of these. Does your partner point to the dishwasher and ask you, 'Hey, are these good?' Mine did, almost daily. Not anymore, though! A breeze to install (our dishwasher is magnetic, but I'm really glad it came with adhesive pads \u2014 someday when we move, if we need them we have them!), and even though I bought it (mostly) as a joke, I use the heck out of it. Slides easily when it needs to.\" \u2014 Andrea Braun Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in six styles). 19. A bestselling ChomChom pet hair remover if you want to see what your clothes, furniture, and other fabric surfaces look like *not* covered in fur. It's reusable and works its magic without using anything sticky (so no residue)! This gadget went super viral based on its results \u2014 and that's when you know a product is good. Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed See the ChomChom roller in action on TikTok ! BuzzFeed Shopping editor Jenae Sitzes swears by this: \"The tens of thousands of 5-star Amazon reviews are reason enough to add the ChomChom to your cart immediately \u2014 but let me add my own personal review to the stack. I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, and I took the photos above to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller \u2014 at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair. It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside , which does require you to apply a bit of pressure. Afterward, you'll just dump out the hair that's been trapped inside. The ChomChom is best for large flat surfaces like couches and beds.\" Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in three colors). 20. And a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator \u2014 I know you're busy, but you simply cannot sit any longer in a house that smells like cat urine. This breaks down stains and odors at their source, leaving your home smelling fresh and citrusy without using harsh ingredients. That one spot behind the couch that your cat won't stop peeing on doesn't stand a chance. \ud83d\udcaa www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This product is amazing!!!! We have a Rottweiler pup and a bichon pup, and our house was feeling the PAIN! I tried everything and used to tell my wife, 'With all the science and technology in the world, we still can\u2019t come up with something that gets rid of the dog mark smell!' This product does everything and more. Just ordered another round. We were about to throw away some furniture due to the smell and now after use we can keep it. Saved me hundreds. Well worth the money. \" \u2014 clayton s tonkin Get it from Amazon for $17.96 (available in two sizes and packs of two or three). 21. A standing weeder that uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. It has a bamboo handle and four steel claws to really dig into those roots and pull them OUT. Your back deserves a break from playing tug of war with stubborn weeds. Amazon Grampa's Gardenware Co. is an Oregon-based, family-owned small business. Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 22. Some foaming garbage disposal cleaning packets to clean out all the gunk from your roommates who just don't understand the concept of throwing food in the garbage instead of down the sink. Just insert a packet into the disposal with hot water trickling to the side, then turn on the disposal and watch it fizz up \u2014 soon, those gag-worthy smells will be a thing of the past. Amazon Promising review: \"Saw on TikTok (don\u2019t judge) and automatically added to cart. So easy to use, takes probably a minute to fully bubble up and clean, and you\u2019re left with a clean sink! I use with other drain cleaning products, but would 100% recommend for weekly maintenance.\" \u2014 Jessica Hamilton Get a four-pack from Amazon for $7.90 (available in a pack of two). 23. And while you're at it, some dishwasher tablets that break down lime and mineral buildup to properly clean your dishwasher (you know, the machine that cleans your dishes ) without *any* effort on your part. Just pop in a tablet and run the dishwasher as normal \u2014 it sure beats having to climb in there yourself and scrub. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and dishes just not getting clean. Then, I became aware that the water softener was no longer doing its job so I had the rental company replace it. Dishwasher performance improved somewhat. I decided to do two more loads before deciding to purchase a new one. Then I saw a product test review for Affresh. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway so I added that to my order. When it came, I tossed one of the tablets into the bottom of the full machine per the instructions and ran the regular cycle. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I will use this faithfully every month, as recommended. \" \u2014 Sheila Get a pack of six tablets from Amazon for $7.49 . 24.

Reviewers love how comfortable they are to hold and how they *stay* sharp. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"Aside from these being a very inexpensive and aesthetic-looking set, they have an excellent, smooth, molded grip that feels good in the hand. The blades are thick, tight, and strong. They are built to last decades. I absolutely love them! Being a teacher, I use them several times daily, all throughout the year. You will NOT be disappointed, (unless for some odd reason you get a defective pair) I promise! \ud83d\ude03\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\" \u2014 gr8female Get a three-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (available in eight color sets and packs of 24 or 36). 25. Bior\u00e9 blackhead removers to help remove all the gunk and buildup that's clogging up your pores.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

You want to squeeze as much life from a laptop or desktop computer as possible. Doing so can save a substantial amount of money over time, and stops you from contributing to mountains of e-waste . At the same time, dealing with an old, sluggish computer is a frustrating experience. If apps and websites are taking ages to load, it can seriously impact your productivity. At a certain point, the temptation to upgrade to a shiny, speedy new computer proves irresistible. A middle ground exists, which is to make sure your laptop or desktop lasts as long as possible. There are multiple tricks you can try when it starts to show its age\u2014tricks that could mean it stays usable for much longer than you expected. Cut down on the clutter You\u2019ll find several programs starting up with Windows or macOS. Screenshot: Apple One way to stretch the life of your computer is to reduce its load. Uninstall any apps you\u2019re not actively using, and keep your apps trim in terms of extensions and add-ons. We\u2019ve covered how to uninstall programs on Windows and macOS , and it\u2019s not difficult to do. Limiting the number of programs starting up with your computer can help too: It means fewer apps running in the background, freeing up more memory and other system resources. You can take care of this with a few clicks on both Windows and macOS . The more storage space you have the better. It gives your computer and its operating system room to breathe and get organized, and can improve performance. Uninstalling apps should help with this, but also be on the lookout for files that you no longer need or can move somewhere else. Choose some upgrades Some well-chosen upgrades can breathe new life into an old computer. While this is going to cost you money, it won\u2019t cost as much as a full upgrade would\u2014and it could mean you get several years of extra use out of your device. The right upgrade will depend on your system\u2019s specs, how much you have to spend, how easy the system is to upgrade, and how comfortable you are with opening up your computer. This is mostly for Windows PCs and for desktops, though a few limited laptop upgrades are sometimes possible. Upgrading the RAM or the storage on your computer are usually the best upgrades for getting the most bang from your bucks. It could be something as straightforward as buying an external hard drive to move files over to, for example. Install another operating system There are plenty of lightweight Linux distros to choose from. Screenshot: Lubuntu In the interests of doing more with older components, you can install a fresh operating system to replace Windows or macOS, one that\u2019s less demanding on your aging computer. This will wipe everything on your system though, so be sure to back up all of your important files and folders first. Linux is always a popular and completely free option, and it comes in many different flavors (known as distros). Some of them, such as Lubuntu , are designed to be as lightweight as possible. Have a browse around the web and you\u2019ll find many options to pick from, as well as detailed guides to how to make the switch. Then there\u2019s ChromeOS Flex , which essentially turns your Windows or Mac computer into a Chromebook. You\u2019re just running a web browser with a few extras, so older computers should be up to the challenge. As with Linux, this is free to do, and it\u2019s perfect if you spend most of your computing time in a web browser anyway. Use your computer for something else Then there\u2019s the option of using your computer for something else , rather than an all-purpose machine. One option is using your aging laptop or desktop as a media server: It doesn\u2019t have to do anything except stream audio and video to other devices on your network. Plex and Emby are two programs that can help. Or how about turning your ancient computer into a dedicated writing machine? This could work if your machine is so old that it\u2019s no longer getting security updates, so shouldn\u2019t really be connected to the web. Set up a word processor and you\u2019re good to go (you will need a USB drive to get your writing shared elsewhere, however). Repurposing your laptop or desktop doesn\u2019t save you from the cost of an upgrade, because you\u2019ll still need to buy another computer, but it does cut down on e-waste and does mean your hardware stays useful for longer. And when you do finally need to get rid of a computer, make sure you do it responsibly .

While the initial reciprocal tariffs will remain for imports, U.S. Customs and Border Protection shared some new exemptions on tech-related goods. The update was announced yesterday evening and follows various tariff increases, particularly on Chinese imports. The exemptions include many products we're excited to see get some relief. The complete list is available in the official bulletin, but it includes computers, smartphones, semiconductor chips, and other tech goods like flat panel TVs, solar cells, and flash drives. The most recent tariff increase from Trump was 145% on Chinese goods. This sent waves across the tech industry, as many realized the significant impact it would have on many tech products that we rely on, including laptops, desktops, CPUs, semiconductor chips, and any PC component. Large companies like Apple, HP, Dell , and more preemptively imported extra stock before the tariff announcement to skirt some of the impact. You may like Tech enthusiasts brace for Trump tariff price hikes on new components Nvidia may avoid recent tariffs on its AI servers \u2014 60% of Nvidia servers pass through Mexico, may be exempt from Trump tariff flurry These exemptions should benefit industry leaders and consumers alike, who have been anticipating serious price hikes on imported products. This should offset the price increases for customers and manufacturers who rely on imports for construction materials. The United States imports around 66% of its tech goods from China, which caused significant concern when tariffs were first announced and subsequently raised on Chinese imports. We recently reported expectations that consoles, monitors, and laptops would be among the most impacted. Many tariffs initially imposed on April 5th will be reduced for 90 days, but tariffs on China have continued to increase . This exemption list is the first we've seen concerning the tariff situation with China. That said, tariffs will remain in place for all other imports not included in the exemption list. The situation is subject to change, but we'll report any significant updates on the tariff situation as things progress, so be sure to check back regularly for more information.

Reply Are you sure that it includes PC components , not just fully-assembled PCs? Also, I expect cases, heatsinks, and radiators are still be affected by the 25% steel & aluminum tariffs, which did not get suspended. Lastly, the \"de minimis\" exemption on small (sub-$800) packages ends May 2nd. That will hit anything shipped directly from abroad (AliExpress, Temu, some sellers on Amazon & ebay, etc.). I'm not sure exactly how that's going to work, but I think you'll be assessed a customs fee that you pay in order to pick up or receive your package. But, it's the recipient who pays. So, don't expect it to be incorporated into sellers' prices. Reply \"The complete list is available in the official bulletin\" No it's not.

Sure it is, but you have to look up what all those headings/sub correspond to here: https://hts.usitc.gov/ Reply sadly, the only groups that will benefit from these exemptions will be the big businesses. they wont reduce their prices, theyll simply pocket the price difference, while consumers continue to pay inflated prices Reply This tariff exemption move is good for consumers and big tech companies, but it also severely undermines the whole point of the tariffs . I'm completely confused on what the objective and strategy is now. I also get the impression that the big tech executives have too much influence when they can create special exemptions for their businesses. Reply thestryker said: https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=8542 So, what's that column labelled \"2\", which says 35% ? Reply bigdragon said: This tariff exemption move is good for consumers and big tech companies, but it also severely undermines the whole point of the tariffs . Yeah, I can imagine more and more exemptions getting created, as that 145% rate on Chinese imports begins to bite and retailers & consumers start to recoil at the prices of things. As for tech products, recall that the same thing happened last time around. There was initial panic about motherboards & graphics cards getting hit, but then they were exempted for a time period that kept getting extended. bigdragon said: I'm completely confused on what the objective and strategy is now. I think the objective hasn't really changed. The strategy is what's now in doubt. bigdragon said: I also get the impression that the big tech executives have too much influence when they can create special exemptions for their businesses. Well, yes but I'm sure their case played well, with AI being seen as a strategic priority. Also, it's not just tech executives...

Business Smartphones and computers are now spared from Trump's reciprocal tariffs Updated April 12, 2025 2:02 PM ET Originally published April 12, 2025 12:58 PM ET Juliana Kim Versions of the new Apple iPhone 16 are displayed at an Apple store in in Manhattan Beach, Calif., on April 8. Jay L Clendenin/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Jay L Clendenin/Getty Images The Trump administration has amended its list of imports that will be affected by sweeping global tariffs in order to exempt certain electronics, including smartphones and computers. Politics China put steep tariffs on U.S. exports. Farmers are worried The updated guidance was published Friday night by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The exemption will apply to President Trump's steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" imposed across dozens of countries, which have since been paused until early July as well as the 145% levies currently in place on China. That was the only country excluded from the reciprocal tariff pause. The exemption is effective for products that entered the U.S. or left warehouses starting on April 5. The White House issued a presidential memo about the exemption on Saturday. Sponsor Message When asked about the reasoning behind the exemption, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.\" Leavitt added, \"At the direction of the President,\" companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \"are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\" The electronics exemption is a major development in the tariff war with China, which has imposed a 125% tariff on U.S. goods . Prices for electronics from China, a key sector, had been expected to spike . Politics Where do tariffs stand? A look at what's in place and what's on pause Among the items that will now be spared from Trump's steep tariffs include smartphones, computers, semiconductors, and flat panel display modules. But the updated guidance did not address any changes to the existing 20% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China's involvement in the fentanyl trade. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission , China has long been America's chief source for electronic products, with Mexico, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaysia rounding out the top five. There was also concern for American tech giants that rely on supply chains in China, like Apple. Before the updated guidance, Apple was expected to experience major setbacks as a result of the tariffs, Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC earlier this week.
