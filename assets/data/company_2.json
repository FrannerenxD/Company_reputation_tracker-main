This update has improved performance for many users, making sure smoother operation across a range of Apple products. However, it has not been without its challenges. Persistent bugs in the Podcasts and Voice Memos apps have left some users frustrated, particularly those who rely on these tools for daily tasks. These glitches, while not universal, have disrupted the seamless experience Apple users have come to expect. The video below from Brandon Butch gives us a look at iOS 18.4 and also the Apple News this week. Watch this video on YouTube . Apple has already begun work on iOS 18.4.1, which is expected to focus on bug fixes and security enhancements. This incremental update aims to address the lingering issues, reinforcing Apple\u2019s commitment to maintaining a high standard of reliability. Meanwhile, the iOS 18.5 beta introduces subtle design changes, such as updates to the Apple Care and Warranty section. While these tweaks improve usability, the absence of the highly anticipated Apple Intelligence features has left some users disappointed. Many had hoped for more significant advancements, raising questions about when these features will finally be introduced. iOS 19: A Glimpse Into the Future Looking ahead, iOS 19 is generating considerable excitement among Apple enthusiasts. Rumors suggest that Apple is planning a major overhaul of Siri , focusing on enhanced personalization capabilities. This update could enable Siri to deliver more tailored responses, adapting to individual user preferences and integrating seamlessly with advanced tools like photo editing features. Such improvements would mark a significant step forward in making Siri a more intuitive and versatile assistant. In addition to functional upgrades, iOS 19 is rumored to adopt a VisionOS-inspired design , featuring rounded icons and a more immersive interface. These aesthetic changes are expected to align with Apple\u2019s evolving design philosophy, creating a more cohesive and visually appealing user experience. If these updates come to fruition, iOS 19 could set a new benchmark for software design and functionality across Apple\u2019s ecosystem. With a potential release in the fall, anticipation is building for what could be one of Apple\u2019s most fantastic updates in recent years. WhatsApp and ChatGPT: Enhancing Everyday Tools Beyond iOS updates, popular apps like WhatsApp and ChatGPT are introducing significant improvements for Apple users. WhatsApp has rolled out several new features designed to enhance communication and productivity, including: Group chat online indicators for better visibility of active participants Enhanced video call functionality, improving the quality and reliability of virtual interactions Document scanning capabilities, streamlining the process of digitizing important files These updates make WhatsApp an even more versatile tool for both personal and professional use. Meanwhile, ChatGPT has expanded its memory capabilities , allowing it to reference past conversations for a more personalized experience. This development aligns with the growing demand for AI-powered tools that adapt to individual preferences. By integrating artificial intelligence more deeply into daily workflows, ChatGPT is becoming an increasingly valuable resource for users seeking efficiency and customization in their digital interactions. Apple Product Leaks and Ecosystem Evolution Speculation about upcoming Apple products continues to generate excitement. Reports suggest that production for the Vision Pro 2 is already underway, hinting at an earlier-than-expected launch. This next-generation device is expected to build on the innovations of its predecessor, further advancing Apple\u2019s ambitions in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Meanwhile, leaks about the iPhone 17 Pro have sparked discussions about potential design changes. While rumors of a two-tone back design have been debunked, reports indicate a larger camera bump, possibly to accommodate improved imaging technology. These developments suggest that Apple is prioritizing advancements in photography and videography, areas where it has consistently led the industry. In addition, WatchOS may soon adopt a VisionOS-inspired aesthetic , signaling Apple\u2019s broader push to unify its ecosystem. This design shift reflects Apple\u2019s commitment to creating a seamless user experience across devices, particularly as it explores new possibilities in AR and VR integration. Supply Chain Shifts and Tariff Impacts Apple is making significant changes to its supply chain, shifting a portion of its production to India . This move is part of a broader strategy to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing while mitigating the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. By diversifying its manufacturing base, Apple aims to enhance the resilience of its supply chain and navigate geopolitical challenges more effectively. While some analysts have speculated that this shift could lead to price increases for Apple products, substantial hikes are unlikely in the short term. Apple\u2019s focus remains on maintaining competitive pricing while making sure the quality and availability of its products. This strategic relocation underscores the company\u2019s commitment to adapting to global economic conditions while safeguarding its market position. Other Noteworthy Developments Apple continues to expand its ecosystem with new tools and features designed to enhance user experiences. The recently released Apple Immersive Video Utility app allows users to manage Vision Pro media more effectively, catering to the growing demand for AR and VR content. This tool reflects Apple\u2019s commitment to supporting its innovative hardware with robust software solutions. On the social media front, Instagram is testing a feature that requires secret codes to access certain Reels, adding an element of exclusivity to content sharing. This experimental feature could reshape how users engage with content on the platform, emphasizing privacy and selectivity. In the realm of home automation, Apple\u2019s Smart Home Hub has been delayed until 2026 due to engineering challenges related to Siri. This delay underscores the complexities of integrating advanced AI into smart home systems, highlighting the technical hurdles that must be overcome to deliver a seamless and reliable user experience. Despite these challenges, Apple remains committed to advancing its smart home initiatives, making sure that its ecosystem continues to evolve in line with user needs.

Seriens producenter Megan Ganz, David Hornsby och Rob McElhenney s\u00e4ger i ett uttalande om att Mythic Quest nu l\u00e4ggs ner: \"Endings are hard.

Som vanligt har HBO valt att l\u00e4gga upp hela avsnittet av programmet och det kan man se ovan. Vill man enbart se tullsnacket s\u00e5 hittar man det nedan. 36.3\u00b0 0 Zeekr 7X kan vara den f\u00f6rsta Teslad\u00f6daren Bakom solglas\u00f6gonen \u00e4r allt tiptop! Jag hatar innerligt uttryck som Teslad\u00f6dare. Men det h\u00e4r kan vara en. Eller den f\u00f6rsta av m\u00e5nga. Och det \u00e4r bra f\u00f6r alla. Tesla, och i Sverige framf\u00f6rallt Model Y, har under m\u00e5nga \u00e5r varit det slutgiltiga svaret p\u00e5 vilken elbil man ska k\u00f6pa om man bara vill ha en bil som kryssar i s\u00e5 m\u00e5nga rutor som det bara g\u00e5r. Som kanske inte \u00e4r b\u00e4st p\u00e5 allt men som \u00e4r bra p\u00e5 det mesta. TL;DR Zeekr levererar en riktigt trevlig suv som sl\u00e5r det mesta p\u00e5 fingrarna, inklusive Tesla. Man levererar mer och b\u00e4ttre p\u00e5 (n\u00e4stan) allt till en riktigt bra prislapp. Det \u00f6ppna m\u00e5l som Tesla har haft under n\u00e5gra \u00e5r \u00e4r nu officiellt st\u00e4ngt. F\u00f6r konkurrenterna har under alla \u00e5r kunnat vara bra p\u00e5 n\u00e5got, men inte p\u00e5 allt. D\u00e4r har Tesla varit b\u00e4st. Bra laddning (och framf\u00f6rallt n\u00e4tverk), gott om utrymmet, bra teknik \u00f6verlag, bra teknik i bilen, bra r\u00e4ckvidd och s\u00e5 vidare. Sen har Model Y varit en otroligt tr\u00e5kig bil att k\u00f6ra, men det har f\u00e5tt st\u00e5 undan n\u00e4r allt annat varit s\u00e5 bra. Tesla har ocks\u00e5 varit bra p\u00e5 att leverera detta till en, i elbilsv\u00e4rlden, vettig prislapp. Anonym rumpa utan loggor Men nu \u00e4r det slut p\u00e5 Teslas dominans. Kineserna, och i viss m\u00e5n europ\u00e9erna, har kommit i kapp, och nu \u00e4ven f\u00f6rbi. Den f\u00f6rsta bilen som visar detta p\u00e5 riktigt h\u00e4r i Sverige \u00e4r Zeekr 7X. Zeekr 7X \u00e4r suv-versionen av en modell som heter Zeekr 007 som aldrig kom hit men som finns i Kina. Eller det verkar som att kombiversionen faktiskt kommer hit, d\u00e5 under namnet Zeekr 7 GT. 35.4\u00b0 0 Jobbar du hemifr\u00e5n?

I serien f\u00e5r vi f\u00f6lja n\u00e5gra av de sista \u00f6verlevande m\u00e4nniskorna efter en zombieapokalyps med ett s\u00e4rskilt fokus p\u00e5 Joel (Pedro Pascal) och Ellie (Bella Ramsey). Den nya s\u00e4songen utspelar sig fem \u00e5r efter seriens f\u00f6rsta s\u00e4song. Joel och den 19-\u00e5riga Ellie h\u00e4nger fortfarande ihop, men relationen \u00e4r anstr\u00e4ngd efter att Joel tidigare f\u00f6rt Ellie bakom ljuset. I den nya s\u00e4songen introduceras \u00e4ven karakt\u00e4ren Abby (Kaitlyn Dever), som har en del otalt med Joel att g\u00f6ra upp, n\u00e5got som b\u00e4ddar f\u00f6r nya konflikter. Max b\u00f6rjade visa det f\u00f6rsta avsnittet i s\u00e4song tv\u00e5 av The Last of Us idag. S\u00e4songen best\u00e5r av sju avsnitt, och det sista avsnittet i s\u00e4songen kommer att visas den 26 maj. 42.4\u00b0 0 Klassisk Alfa Romeo Giulia med 670 h\u00e4star Henry k\u00f6r restomodden fr\u00e5n Totem Om man vill ha en bil med klassiskt Alfa Romeo-utseende kan man h\u00f6ra av sig till Totem Automobili som bygger GT Super. Det \u00e4r en restomoddad Giulia d\u00e4r i princip bara formerna finns kvar, allt annat \u00e4r uppdaterat och f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrat. En sak kvarst\u00e5r dock - k\u00f6rgl\u00e4djen. Nu har Henry Catchpole f\u00e5tt k\u00f6ra besten och han diggar den stenh\u00e5rt. 38.8\u00b0 0 Fourier sl\u00e4pper open source-roboten N1 Bygg ihop din egen humanoida robot Fourier, en av Kinas ledande robottillverkare, har visat upp en humanoid open source-robot som man kallar f\u00f6r N1. Tanken bakom N1 \u00e4r bland annat att den ska locka fler utvecklare till robotbranschen. Fourier N1 \u00e4r 130 centimeter l\u00e5ng och v\u00e4ger 38 kg. Den kan r\u00f6ra sig fram\u00e5t i en hastighet p\u00e5 3,5 meter i sekunden, n\u00e5got som motsvarar cirka 12,5 km/h. Batteriet ska r\u00e4cka f\u00f6r drift i cirka tv\u00e5 timmar. Hela robotens design \u00e4r \u00f6ppen att ta del av och f\u00f6r\u00e4ndra under open source-licens. Det inneb\u00e4r att det kommer att bli m\u00f6jligt att ladda hem designen av roboten, vilka komponenter och material som anv\u00e4nts f\u00f6r att bygga den samt mjukvaran som driver roboten. I videoklippet nedan kan ni kolla in lite av vad Fourier N1 klarar av i sin grunddesign. 38.8\u00b0 0 Toshiba har gjort en b\u00e4rbar skivspelare Ta med dig dina LP-skivor med Aurex AX-RP10 Toshiba ger sig in i segmentet d\u00e4r vi hittar bland annat Audio-Technicas Sound Burger med nya Aurex AX-RP10, som \u00e4r en ny portabel skivspelare designad f\u00f6r vinylentusiaster som vill g\u00f6ra sina analoga musiksamlingar mer b\u00e4rbara. Aurex \u00e4r tillr\u00e4ckligt kompakt f\u00f6r att b\u00e4ras i en medf\u00f6ljande axelremsv\u00e4ska och klarar av att spela fullstora 12-tumsskivor. Den laddas med USB-C och har ett inbyggt batteri med upp till 10 timmars speltid. AX-RP10 spelar skivor i b\u00e5de 33 1/3 och 45 varv per minut, anv\u00e4nder MM-pickuper och \u00e4r remdriven. Den saknar inbyggda h\u00f6gtalare men erbjuder b\u00e5de en 3,5 mm ljudutg\u00e5ng f\u00f6r anslutning av h\u00f6rlurar eller en extern ljudanl\u00e4ggning, samt Bluetooth f\u00f6r tr\u00e5dl\u00f6s koppling till h\u00f6rlurar och h\u00f6gtalare. Vad priset kommer att hamna p\u00e5 vet vi inte \u00e4nnu, men skivspelaren f\u00f6rv\u00e4ntas b\u00f6rja levereras n\u00e5gon g\u00e5ng nu under april. 37.5\u00b0 0 Polestar verkar dra ner i Kina Avbryter samarbete med Meizu Polestar m\u00e5 vara en produkt sprungen ur Volvo, men mycket fokus har legat p\u00e5 Kina f\u00f6r varum\u00e4rket. Man har i princip all tillverkning d\u00e4r, f\u00f6rutom Polestar 3 som ocks\u00e5 ska tillverkas i USA. Man har \u00e4ven teknikcenter i Nanjing. Men det g\u00e5r s\u00e5d\u00e4r med f\u00f6rs\u00e4ljningen, man s\u00e5lde bara drygt 3000 bilar i Kina under f\u00f6rra \u00e5ret. Totalt s\u00e5lde man 44.850 bilar. Det ska dock s\u00e4gas att Polestar 4, som nog fr\u00e4mst \u00e4r den modell som kan fungera i Kina, kom f\u00f6rst i slutet av \u00e5ret. Nu verkar man dra ner p\u00e5 fokuset p\u00e5 landet. Om man vill k\u00f6pa en Polestar s\u00e5 finns det fortfarande 36 st\u00e4llen att bes\u00f6ka enligt hemsidan, men i appen ska det bara finnas tio platser att provk\u00f6ra. Tio st\u00e4llen \u00e4r v\u00e4ldigt lite \u00e4ven i Sverige. Man har \u00e4ven avslutat samarbetet med Meizu som man har haft ett tag. Det resulterade bland annat i en mobiltelefon, men Meizu har \u00e4ven hj\u00e4lpt till med f\u00f6rs\u00e4ljning och kundservice. Om man drar ner p\u00e5 riktigt eller om man t\u00e4nker ta nya tag fram\u00f6ver \u00e4r oklart. 37.5\u00b0 0 Mercedes T-Klass och Citan s\u00e4ljer f\u00f6r d\u00e5ligt L\u00e4ggs ner V\u00e5ren 2022 lanserade Mercedes den nya modellen T-Klass som \u00e4r en liten minibuss. Det \u00e4r en slags m\u00e4nnisko-version av den befintliga modellen Citan som \u00e4r en klassisk hantverkarbil. Nu l\u00e4ggs b\u00e4gge modellerna ner f\u00f6r att de s\u00e4ljer f\u00f6r d\u00e5ligt. N\u00e4sta \u00e5r kommer tillverkningen att upph\u00f6ra och Mercedes kommer ist\u00e4llet att fokusera p\u00e5 st\u00f6rre modeller som \u00e4r mer l\u00f6nsamma. N\u00e5gra direkta ers\u00e4ttare \u00e4r i dagsl\u00e4get inte planerade. F\u00f6rra \u00e5ret s\u00e5ldes 23.351 exemplar av Citan och bara 5117 av T-Klass. 37.7\u00b0 0 Samsung presenterar nya strykt\u00e5liga enheter Galaxy XCover7 Pro har ett l\u00f6stagbart batteri Nu har Samsung presenterat tv\u00e5 nya strykt\u00e5liga enheter designade f\u00f6r f\u00f6retagsanv\u00e4ndare och lite mer kr\u00e4vande arbetsmilj\u00f6er. Vi har den nya telefonen Galaxy XCover7 Pro tillsammans med surfplattan Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro. B\u00e5da modellerna erbjuder f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrad h\u00e5llbarhet med IP68-klassning f\u00f6r vatten- och dammt\u00e5lighet samt MIL-STD-810H-certifiering mot st\u00f6tar, extrema temperaturer och vibrationer. Prestandan har uppgraderats med Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 p\u00e5 b\u00e5da enheterna, 6 eller 8 GB RAM, 5G-st\u00f6d och Wi-Fi 6E.

Tanken bakom designen p\u00e5 sadeln \"VabsRider\" \u00e4r att den ska kunna r\u00f6ra sig i takt med att cyklisten trampar p\u00e5 pedalerna, n\u00e5got som f\u00f6retaget s\u00e4ger ska minska risken f\u00f6r sm\u00e4rtor.

If you donx27t want a part of your body to get sore, then that part shouldnx27t be pushing against something that doesnx27t move along with it.

Alla som sett serien Severance p\u00e5 Apple TV+ har nog \u00e5tminstone funderat p\u00e5 hur det hade varit att ha ett av tangentborden och arbetsstationerna fr\u00e5n serien. Snart beh\u00f6ver du inte undra l\u00e4nge. F\u00f6retaget Atomic Keyboard ska n\u00e4mligen sl\u00e4ppa MDR Dasher Keyboard, som \u00e4r ett nytt tangentbord som h\u00e4mtat stark inspiration fr\u00e5n serien. Designen \u00e4r en n\u00e4ra replika av de retro-terminaler som anv\u00e4nds p\u00e5 den fiktiva arbetsplatsen Lumon Industries, som i sin tur \u00e4r baserade p\u00e5 verklighetens Data General Dasher-terminaler fr\u00e5n 70- och 80-talet. Tangentbordet har en kompakt 70-procent-layout med 73 tangenter i bl\u00e5tt och vitt, ett chassi i aluminium samt en optisk styrkula placerad p\u00e5 h\u00f6ger sida. Den mest anm\u00e4rkningsv\u00e4rda designdetaljen \u00e4r dock att tangentbordet saknar Escape-, Control- och Option-tangenter, som en blinkning till seriens teman om inst\u00e4ngdhet och brist p\u00e5 kontroll. MDR Dasher riktar sig d\u00e4rf\u00f6r fr\u00e4mst till samlare och stora fans av serien.

En som kom p\u00e5 ett ganska s\u00e5 kul lur var Youtubern Fabian Svorono. Han kokade ihop att Tesla hade k\u00f6pt hamburgerkedjan Max. Han hyrde tv\u00e5 Teslor, parkerade dessa utanf\u00f6r en Max-restaurang i Stockholm, gjorde rollups och delade ut gratis kaffe till f\u00f6rbipasserande.

Kronkursen fortsatte att st\u00e4rkas mot dollarn under dagen och i skrivande stund kostar en dollar 9,66 kronor. Det kan j\u00e4mf\u00f6ras med att en dollar kostade 11,07 kronor vid \u00e5rsskiftet, n\u00e5got som inneb\u00e4r att kronkursen har \u00f6kat med \u00f6ver 14 procent j\u00e4mf\u00f6rt med dollarn sedan dess. En euro kostar nu 10,98 kronor vilket kan j\u00e4mf\u00f6ras med de 11,45 kronor euron kostade vid \u00e5rsskiftet, en \u00f6kning f\u00f6r kronan med lite \u00f6ver 4 procent. Anledningen till att kronan har st\u00e4rkts den senaste tiden verkar bero p\u00e5 att investerare anser att kronan \u00e4r en n\u00e5gorlunda trygg valuta, n\u00e5got som vanligtvis inte \u00e4r fallet. Robert Bergqvist, SEB:s seniorekonom, s\u00e4ger till TT: \u2013 Det \u00e4r v\u00e4ldigt ovanligt det vi ser nu. N\u00e4r det \u00e4r st\u00f6kigt och oroliga tider brukar man ist\u00e4llet s\u00f6ka sig bort fr\u00e5n de mindre valutorna som till exempel den svenska kronan. \u2013 Men nu har det h\u00e4r m\u00f6nstret f\u00f6r\u00e4ndrats. Nu har det n\u00e4stan blivit tv\u00e4rtom. Det vill s\u00e4ga att dollarn har blivit en cyklisk valuta, som tappar n\u00e4r oron \u00f6kar. Medan kronan har blivit en s\u00e5 kallad defensiv valuta som m\u00e5nga s\u00f6ker till f\u00f6r trygghet. 61.0\u00b0 0 SVT tidigarel\u00e4gger Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen Drar ig\u00e5ng i natt SVT meddelade idag att man kommer att b\u00f6rja s\u00e4nda sin slow-tv-show Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen en vecka tidigare \u00e4n planerat. Anledningen till tidigarel\u00e4ggningen av programmet beror p\u00e5 att v\u00e4rmen gjort att \u00e4lgarna redan har b\u00f6rjat vandra, n\u00e5got som tvingat SVT att g\u00f6ra en \u00e4ndring i sitt s\u00e4ndningsprogram.

Den f\u00f6rsta varianten av Vision Pro, som lanserades i USA i februari f\u00f6rra \u00e5ret, kostar fortfarande fr\u00e5n 500 dollar och v\u00e4ger cirka 680 gram. Ut\u00f6ver den l\u00e4ttare och billigare modellen uppger Gurman att Apple \u00e4ven utvecklar en annan version av Vision Pro som ska kunna anslutas med kabel direkt till en Mac-dator. Syftet med detta \u00e4r att skapa en upplevelse med extremt l\u00e5g f\u00f6rdr\u00f6jning. Med detta skulle man kunna f\u00f6rlita sig b\u00e4ttre p\u00e5 kr\u00e4vande professionella applikationer genom att str\u00f6mma Mac-sk\u00e4rmen eller anv\u00e4nda headsetet f\u00f6r exempelvis kirurgisk bildvisning eller i flygsimulatorer.

Handlingen kretsar runt hur Godzilla vaknar upp och hotar att f\u00f6rst\u00f6ra v\u00e4rlden. Efter att Marvel-hj\u00e4ltarna inte lyckas besegra besten p\u00e5 egen hand tvingas de kalla in n\u00e5gra av jordens v\u00e4rsta superskurkar f\u00f6r att tillsammans f\u00f6rs\u00f6ka ge Godzilla en match.

However, the chip sector faced headwinds due to national security concerns. This exemption raised hopes for improved trade relations, supported by better-than-expected loan data and anticipated policy support. AP China and Hong Kong stocks rebounded on Monday, fueled by gains in tech shares after the U.S. exempted smartphones and computers from tariffs. China and Hong Kong stocks rose on Monday as tech shares climbed after the White House exempted smartphones and computers from \"reciprocal\" U.S. tariffs, while the chip sector was weighed down by national security concerns . China's blue-chip CSI300 Index climbed 0.5%, while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.9% by the midday trading break, after losing 2.9% and 3.1% last week, respectively. Hong Kong benchmark's Hang Seng climbed 2.4% after an 8.5% loss last week. The Hang Seng Tech Index added 2.7%. Trump's administration granted exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones, computers and other electronics imported largely from China, while indicating these goods will come under separate tariffs, along with semiconductors, that may be imposed within a month. China's Apple suppliers jumped on the temporary relief. The CSI Electronics Index jumped 0.9% by midday. Apple's main assembly partner Foxconn Industrial Internet rallied 1.1%, and acoustic components manufacturer Goertek jumped 2.5%. Live Events Keeping a lid on gains, the CSI Semiconductor Index declined as much as 0.9% after Trump said that chips from China will face a national security probe over the next week. The news of the exemption \"fuels expectation of potential improvement in trade relations, and even the prospect of trade negotiations,\" said Li Shuding, an investor adviser of Galaxy Securities. He added that March loan data was better than expected, and \"we expect intensive roll-out of policies\" to support the economy. Before Monday's rebound, the CSI 300 Index and Hang Seng Index had lost 3.5% and 9.9%, respectively, since \"Liberation Day\" on April 2. Trump threatened to implement sweeping tariffs against trading partners with China being the major target, raising concerns about slowing global economic growth and disruptions to trade. Goldman Sachs has revised its 12-month targets for MSCI China and the CSI300 Index, lowering them to 75 and 4,300, respectively, down from previous estimates of 81 and 4,500, respectively. \" U.S.-China trade tensions have soared to unprecedented levels, prompting concerns about global recession, and decoupling risks between the two largest economies globally in other strategic cohorts, notably capital markets, technology, and geopolitics,\" China strategist Kinger Lau said in a note on Monday. Elsewhere, China's exports in March rose 12.4% from a year earlier, handily beating 4.4% growth expected in a Reuters poll of economists after factories rushed out shipments before the latest U.S. tariffs took effect.

Last week, it was learnt that the carmaker rolled out the Flyme Auto S version 1.1.4 firmware update for a host of fixes . According to a presentation slide that was photographed, the over-the-air updates are pushed to customer vehicles on a quarterly basis. Completed so far as of its April OTA update are charging start/stop button, optimised braking and the ability for owners to view the vehicle\u2019s location when it is asleep. The next update set for the second quarter of this year, to be rolled out approximately in July, will include wireless Apple CarPlay, switchable \u201cice-cream van\u201d sound , access to third-party apps, radio scanning fix, as well as other to-be-announced improvements. This will be followed by updates scheduled for Q3 2025, to be released approximately in October. These will include wired Apple CarPlay, a memory function for speed warning switching, and other improvements. Wrapping up the updates timeline in Q4 2025 in December will be wired and wireless Android Auto, along with other updates. Launched towards the end of last year, the Proton eMas 7 made its debut with two variants \u2013 Prime and Premium \u2013 each with a front-mounted electric motor producing 218 PS and 320 Nm. This propels Proton\u2019s first electric SUV from 0-100 km/h in 6.9 seconds and on to a top speed of 175 km/h. The Prime starts the range with a 49.52 kWh battery offering 345 km of range while the Premium brings a 60.022 kWh unit that is good for 410 km (both on the WLTP testing standard), and both are the Geely Aegis short-blade lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery. Charging the eMas 7 from 30 to 80% takes 20 minutes using DC fast charging at up to 100 kW with the Premium (80 kW for the Prime), while a full charge using an 11 kW AC wallbox takes 4.9 hours for the Prime and 6.1 hours for the Premium. The eMas 7 is also the first Proton to get a suite of driver assistance features, including Level 2 semi-autonomous driving capabilities. Looking to sell your car? Sell it with Carro .

By Debby Wu, Josh Wingrove, and Shawn Donnan, Bloomberg | Updated: 14 April 2025 13:03 IST Photo Credit: Apple Trump\u2019s tariffs upended global markets, triggered a selloff in stocks Highlights The exclusions were published late Friday US Customs and Border Protection published the exclusions The move is the first major softening of any kind in Trump\u2019s conflicts Advertisement President Donald Trump's administration exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from its so-called reciprocal tariffs, representing a major reprieve for global technology manufacturers including Apple and Nvidia even if it proves a temporary one. The exclusions, published late Friday by US Customs and Border Protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump's 125 percent China tariff and his baseline 10 percent global tariff on nearly all other countries. The exclusions apply to smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips as well as flat-screen displays. Those popular consumer electronics items generally aren't made in the US. Apple Said to Have Airlifted 600 Tons of iPhones From India The pause will be welcome news to consumers, some of whom rushed to buy new iPhones and other devices amid fears that the tariffs would send prices soaring. It's also a big win for major technology companies that have presented massive US spending pledges for Trump in recent months. Trump's tariffs upended global markets, triggered a selloff in stocks and ignited a rapidly escalating trade war with China. The move is the first significant softening of any kind in Trump's conflict with China. It was backdated to April 5. The exemptions cover almost $390 billion (roughly Rs. 33,57,764 crore) in US imports based on official US 2024 trade statistics, including more than $101 billion (roughly Rs. 86,9,574 crore) from China, according to data compiled by Gerard DiPippo, associate director of the Rand China Research Center. Apple Exported $17 Billion in iPhones From India Last Year, Minister Says The biggest category related to China is smartphones. The US imported smartphones valued at more than $41 billion (roughly Rs. 3,52,995 crore) from China in 2024, or about nine percent of total imports from China. Also covered are computers and similar devices, of which the US imported more than $36 billion (roughly Rs 3,09.947 crore) in 2024. Altogether the exemptions cover consumer electronics and semiconductors that accounted for about 22 percent of US imports from China in 2024, DiPippo said. \u201cThis is a large hole in the US tariff wall that will spare key firms like Apple and consumers of laptops and phones from sticker shock,\u201d he said. \u201cBut many other consumer, intermediate, and capital goods from China still face prohibitively high US tariffs. This exemption only covers one segment of the US economy.\u201d Trump on Saturday declined to elaborate on the exemptions but hinted at further developments on Monday. \u201cI'll give you that answer on Monday. We'll be very specific on Monday,\u201d he told reporters on Air Force One. \u201cWe're taking in a lot of money; as a country we're taking in a lot of money.\u201d The White House also released a corresponding memo indicating that the exemptions also extend to changes in small-parcel shipping duties. Trump had moved to end the so-called \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption, beginning with China, that generally means parcels worth $800 (roughly Rs. 68,880) or below don't face duties. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacturing critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cThat's why the president has secured trillions of dollars in US investments from the largest tech companies in the world.\u201d She said those companies are \u201chustling to onshore\u201d their manufacturing to the US. The tariff reprieve may prove fleeting. The exclusions stem from the initial order, which prevented extra tariffs on certain sectors from stacking cumulatively on top of the country-wide rates. The exclusion is a sign that the products may soon be subject to a different tariff, albeit almost surely a lower one for China. The products that won't be subject to Trump's new tariffs include machines used to make semiconductors. That would be important for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which has announced a major new investment in the US, as well as other chipmakers. \u201cAll products that are properly classified in these listed provisions will be excluded from the reciprocal tariffs,\u201d the notice said. The move appeared to exclude the products from the 10 percent global baseline tariff on other countries, including Samsung Electronics' home of South Korea. The tariff reprieve does not extend to a separate Trump levy on China \u2014 a 20 percent duty applied to pressure Beijing to crack down on fentanyl, including the shipment of precursor materials. Other previously existing levies, including those that predate Trump's current term, also appear unaffected. \u201cThe US tech industry has a loud voice and despite initial strong pushback against exemptions within the White House the reality of the situation was finally recognised in the Beltway,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Saturday. \u201cThere is still clear uncertainty and volatility ahead with these China negotiations.\u201d The original list of tariff exemptions included some semiconductor products \u2014 including central processing units known as CPUs. But those measures did not carve out tech products crucial to AI development including graphics processing units, or GPUs, and the servers that they power. Servers powered by AI chips from companies such as Nvidia and their critical components are primarily manufactured and assembled in Taiwan and Mexico. Friday's announcement would cover both Taiwanese and Mexican production, in a significant reprieve for companies seeking to build AI infrastructure in the US. Semiconductor Equipment Exemptions Also crucial are new exemptions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment, made by companies such as ASML Holding NV in the Netherlands and Tokyo Electron Ltd. in Japan. Those tools are essential for building chip factories, and comprise the lion's share of the multibillion dollar price tag for such plants. Companies including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel Corp. are building new US facilities with support from the 2022 Chips and Science Act. Trump's initial \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff announcement included exemptions for semiconductors and other sectors, to which Trump has regularly pledged to apply a specific tariff. He hasn't yet done so but the latest exclusions are related to that exemption. The move excludes most of Apple's core products from the escalating tariffs on China, including iPhones, iPads and Apple watches. Apple shares have slid since Trump announced the tariffs. Discussions gained additional urgency in recent days after Trump increased the tariffs on China, putting companies like Apple in a more difficult position than competitors like Samsung, who are less reliant on China. Companies and tech industry lobbyists have also argued that reshoring the final assembly of smartphones and other products is impossible, one person familiar with the discussions said. But the move also is aimed at laying the groundwork for new targeted sectoral tariffs that are likely to hit the industry. The administration is expected to soon launch a new investigation into imports of semiconductors. That would eventually lead to the imposition of tariffs on chips within weeks or months. Those duties, like ones imposed recently on steel and aluminum, are likely to impose duties on products that include semiconductors as well as the chips themselves. Trump's sectoral tariffs have so far been set at 25 percent, though it's not clear what his rate on semiconductors and related products would be. It's also not clear how widely he would apply that tariff. Representatives from Nvidia and ASML declined to comment. Spokesmen for Tokyo Electron didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The US International Trade Commission declined to comment on the exemptions, while the US Trade Representative and the Department of Commerce didn't respond to requests for comment. \u00a9 2025 Bloomberg LP (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Facebook X LinkedIn Copy to Clipboard Copy North America Analysis Economy Technology World Tech tariff trainwreck: Mad King Donald backflips on the backflip Can you backflip on a backflip after another backflip? That\u2019s what Donald Trump has done with his \u2018exemption\u2019 for computer equipment. Bernard Keane Glenn Dyer Apr 14, 2025 4 min read Share 0 US President Donald Trump (Image: ABACAPRESS/Matias J. Ocner) The working rule for any major announcement by Donald Trump is that it will be reversed, modified or dismissed as never having happened within a matter of days. And that appears to apply as much to the reversals and modifications themselves. So that tariff backflip revealed on Friday (not the initial backflip, to reduce tariffs to 10% for everyone other than China, but the backflip to exclude semiconductor chips, smartphones and laptops made in China from the-nearly 150% tariffs on China) which was widely seen to have saved the bacon of Apple , given its reliance on Chinese manufacturing, turns out not to be an exemption at all. There will instead be a specific tech tariff, the administration said yesterday. \u201cNOBODY is getting \u2018off the hook\u2019,\u201d Trump raved . \u201cThere was no Tariff \u2018exception\u2019 announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u2018bucket.\u2019 The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.\u201d The additional tech tariffs won\u2019t be revealed for one to two months, presumably giving the administration time to cobble together an equivalent to the kind of irrational, innumerate mathematical model it used to work up its now-ditched \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. Related Article Block Placeholder Article ID: 1202161 Trump wants allies in his war on China. Albanese and Marles will bend the knee \u2014 as will Dutton Bernard Keane 139 Friday\u2019s electronics backflip-that-wasn\u2019t was disseminated not via a White House PR stunt but a US Customs and Border Protection Service notice to shippers, which contained a list of tariff codes excluded from the import taxes, retroactive to 12.01am EDT (3.01pm Sydney time) on Saturday, April 5. Reuters reported that the notice \u201clisted 20 product categories, including the broad 8471 code for all computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing. It also included semiconductor devices, equipment, memory chips and flat panel displays\u201d. That still leaves billions of dollars worth of kitchen and other households goods, toys, foodstuffs, machinery, car parts and similar products still paying the 145% China tariff. Big companies like Walmart, Target, Tesla, Ford, GM, Stellantis and their customers all face a sharp rise in costs and prices. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when it committed to invest US$500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. It similarly pledged a US$350 billion investment during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. This time the exemption took days to appear, and investors sold Apple shares down heavily as they speculated it would be the most impacted from the tariffs of all the tech heavies. That saw the market value of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks \u2014 Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms \u2014 slump US$2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2. Trump\u2019s latest move will add to the belief among investors and in bond markets that his administration has injected a permanent sense of uncertainty into US economic policy. Who can plan investment with any certainty when the price of key inputs can double on the whim of an irrational ignoramus? And if the goal of the tariffs remains both to generate massive revenue to fund Trump\u2019s tax cuts and force the onshoring of all manufacturing to the US in a form of modern-day autarky, where will the US get the skilled workers needed, given Trump inherited an unemployment rate of 4%? Certainly not migration \u2014 under Trump, the US is now overly hostile to visitors of any kind, let alone people who might want to consider offering their skills to US employers. He also seems to have undermined, at least for the medium term, confidence in the safe haven status of the US and its bonds, which is what caused the initial tariff backflip last week. The Federal Reserve (hated by Trump because of its independence) stepped in on Friday with well-timed comments aimed at bond market investors. Boston Fed president Susan Collins told the Financial Times that the US central bank would \u201cabsolutely be prepared\u201d to deploy its various tools to help stabilise the financial markets if the need arose. You know confidence in US bonds and the country\u2019s credit worthiness is shot when a senior member of the Fed has to go public to emphasise that the central bank will be there to clean up the mess Trump is making. But Treasury yields remained elevated over the weekend at 4.482%, reflecting that Trump\u2019s volatility is materially adding to the risk of what was until recently the crucial safe haven of global finance.

Join Our WhatsApp Channel Business Today Bureau Updated Apr 14, 2025, 10:59 AM IST iPhone maker Foxconn plans to expand in India, create jobs The Uttar Pradesh government is reportedly in talks with iPhone manufacturer Foxconn to set up a new facility in the Greater Noida region. According to sources, UP government officials and representatives of the Taiwanese company have already held two rounds of meetings at Delhi and Lucknow on the proposed project. The new facility is likely to centre around mobile phone manufacturing. Related Articles Foxconn to double iPhone production in India as Apple deepens local manufacturing push: Report Apple supplier Foxconn to start AirPods production in Hyderabad for export market: Report The Greater Noida facility would add to the company's, which is Apple\u2019s largest contract manufacturer globally, existing base in the country. The facility is proposed to be set up on around 300-acres of land. It would be in addition to the 50-acre joint venture project that Foxconn has with HCL for an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facility, sources said. Meanwhile, reports from earlier in the year had indicated that HCL-Foxconn joint venture, which is separate from this new plant, has begun talks with Larsen & Toubro (L&T) as well as Taiwanese major CTCI for the semiconductor assembly and testing (OSAT) facility. The JV is also awaiting Cabinet approval. Foxconn is reportedly investing $37.2 million to hold a 40 per cent stake in the venture. The new facility is expected to create 40,000 jobs and will include residences for all workers inside the complex. Sources added that the UP government was interested in the project as the Noida-Greater Noida region already accounts for nearly 50 per cent of all mobile phone exports from the country. \u201cThere is no better place than UP to have a facility for Apple. Locating it in Noida will add to the ecosystem in the region,\u201d sources added. Foxconn started manufacturing iPhone 15 in its Tamil Nadu facility in Sriperumbudur in 2023. Apple ferried 600 tons of iPhones, or as many as 1.5 million, to the US just after announcements of Trump\u2019s tariffs. The company lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut the time needed to clear customs at the Chennai airport from 30 hours to six hours.

Cell C is the fourth-largest mobile network operator in South Africa, , after Vodacom, MTN, and Telkom. The company founded in 2001 offers prepaid and postpaid mobile plans, data bundles and internet services, fiber broadband, roaming and international calling, SIM-only plans and device deals. Cell C has confirmed a data breach following a RansomHouse cyberattack that occurred last year. The ransomware group has since leaked the stolen data on its dark web leak site. The gang claimed the theft of 2 TB of data. Compromised data includes full names, contact details, ID numbers, banking information, driver\u2019s license numbers, medical records and passport details. Cell C stated that threat actors gained unauthorized access to some of its IT systems. \u201cCell C is aware that data compromised in the recent cybersecurity incident has been unlawfully disclosed by RansomHouse, the threat actor claiming responsibility.\u201d states the company . \u201cThis follows a previously reported incident involving unauthorised access to unstructured data in some parts of our IT environment.\u201d Cell C has taken swift action to contain a recent cyberattack, secure its systems, and limit the impact. The company engaged top cybersecurity and forensic experts, informed authorities, and is actively supporting affected stakeholders. They continue to monitor for potential data misuse and urge vigilance against fraud, phishing, and identity theft. Cell C has also shared fraud prevention resources, including guidance on registering with SAFPS for extra protection. RansomHouse is a data extortion group that has been active since Dec 2021. Unlike other extortion group, the gang doesn\u2019t encrypt data, but focuses on data theft to speed up its activity. Victims include AMD and Keralty. They shame non-payers by leaking data. Backups are insufficient; IPS is recommended for protection. American hospitals are a privileged target for threat actors due to the huge trove of sensitive data they manage. Ransomware attacks on U.S. healthcare providers surged in 2024, with 98 attacks compromising 117 million records . Hospitals often face system lockdowns, forcing a switch to manual processes. High-profile breaches include Change Healthcare (100M records), Summit Pathology (1.8M), OnePoint Patient Care (796K), and Boston Children\u2019s Health Physicians (909K). In 2023, Loretto Hospital experienced another data security incident . On January 19, 2023, a former employee misappropriated security camera footage of a limited number of patients and posted it on Facebook. The footage was removed after the incident was discovered. Loretto identified the impacted individuals and notified them by mail on March 15, 2023, offering guidance on protecting their information. The exposed information consisted of security camera footage of a small number of patients.

Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Follow Author Apr 14, 2025, 01:26am EDT Share Save Comment Amazon's new agentic AI system, \"Nova Act,\" is set to transform how we interact with technology in ... More our homes, potentially outperforming competitors from OpenAI and Anthropic. Adobe Stock The next wave of AI transformation will be driven by agents . Rather than simply asking questions or following prompts, these AI tools will carry out complex tasks and act with far more autonomy. This will change a lot of things as we become able to delegate more and more tasks to machines. By connecting with external applications, agents can take care of shopping, scheduling, managing travel, and many of our day-to-day interactions with digital services. Amazon has long been on a mission to bring AI into the home, and the sound of Alexa\u2019s voice is familiar around the world (even if it has been reported that she\u2019s mostly used as a very overpowered timer.) With homes increasingly filled with smart gadgets, agentic AI clearly has the potential to further streamline the way we engage with technology in our homes. However, Amazon\u2019s plans are likely to go further. Here\u2019s what we know about them so far and a look at what it could mean for smart homes of the future. What Is Nova Act? Amazon recently became the latest of the AI giants to unveil their own agentic AI model, called Nova Act. Similar to ChatGPT Operator, it can take control of a web browser and use it to do many of the same things we can do. MORE FOR YOU Trump Administration Freezes $2.2 Billion In Harvard Federal Funding After University Refuses To Comply With Demands Today\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Tuesday, April 15th WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades On April 14, 2025 Before WrestleMania 41 When you think of how many day-to-day activities we use apps on our phones for, it becomes clear how big the impact of this on our lives could be. According to Amazon, Nova Act is capable of booking trips, completing online purchases and managing calendars and to-do lists. One difference between Nova Act and competing agentic platforms like Operator is that the technology will be built into an upcoming upgrade to Alexa . This could potentially be amazing, with home AI assistants becoming much more useful. Of course, there would be some fairly sturdy privacy guardrails in place for technology like this that could potentially gather very intimate details of our day-to-day lives. According to this TechCrunch report , Nova Act outperforms competitors, including tools from OpenAI and Anthropic, at some of the key tests used to rate agentic AI performance. Agentic AI Assistants Rival agentic services like Operator and Manus may be available (like Nova Act, they are research previews) but don\u2019t have this same potential backdoor into millions of homes. Popular voice assistants brought mainstream adoption for voice-activated computing, but they have been slow to integrate LLM technology of the type used by ChatGPT. After chatting to a voice LLM chatbot like ChatGPT, going back to trying to have a conversational user experience with Alexa (or Siri, or whoever) is frustrating. They\u2019re clearly far less good at holding a conversation or understanding nuanced commands. What they are good at, though, is working with an ecosystem of connected apps and services. By jumping to agentic, Amazon can make home assistants that are capable and conversational like ChatGPT but also have a framework for communicating and controlling external services, as Alexa and Siri can. We\u2019ve recently seen Apple integrate its Apple Intelligence platform into Siri in the hope it will lead to an \"iPhone moment\" for genAI-equipped handsets. Google is taking a slightly different approach, with its Gemini chatbot acting as a standalone voice AI rather than attempting to integrate with the existing Google Assistant. For the moment, at least. So it\u2019s clear that the big AI companies all think the time is right for us to start welcoming the next generation of agentic smart technology into our homes. But would that actually be a smart idea? The Pitfalls Of Agentic AI In The Home Agentic AI has the potential to be hugely transformational. And so there are some pretty big concerns that need to be addressed before we can be confident that society has an informed view of the risks and challenges. These include cybersecurity concerns. Whenever we integrate new technology, particularly into our homes, we need to be sure we aren\u2019t creating new vulnerabilities that can be targeted. Then there's the glaring issue of privacy. Concerns have long existed about how securely smart speakers protect the personal conversations they hear. With autonomous, always-active agents, the risk of privacy invasion becomes even greater. More generally, some people are concerned that becoming too reliant on AI for menial and routine tasks could lead to us becoming over-reliant and helpless, perhaps even to the detriment of human problem-solving or decision-making ability. We should also consider the potential ramifications of AI hallucinations . No one is really sure how the LLM chatbot's propensity to simply make things up will transfer and scale to an agentic, action-based system, but it\u2019s not difficult to predict that things could get messy. At the end of the day, though, I think it\u2019s inevitable that agentic AI will play an increasingly major role in our lives, including in the home. Amazon has as good a shot at making it happen as anyone, thanks to the market penetration of Echo and Alexa. But one thing that\u2019s certain is that with AI, everything is still to play for. In the near future, many more services and devices will offer agentic AI in the home as we start to get a better understanding of what it can do and how it can help us.

But speaking on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, Mr Lutnick said such products would be re-examined as part of a government probe into semiconductors, which face a separate round of tariffs.

Read Time: 3 mins Share Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Reddit Email He highlighted China's unique advantage in having a large pool of highly skilled workers. When Donald Trump launched his tariff war with China, he expressed hopes for major companies like Apple to manufacture their products in the United States. However, industry experts and critics argued that large-scale manufacturing in America isn't practical due to various reasons. Amid this, an old video of Apple CEO Tim Cook has resurfaced on social media, where he explains why Apple continues to manufacture its products in China. In the video, Mr Cook debunked the common belief that companies flock to China for cheap labour. Instead, he highlighted the importance of China's extensive supply chain, infrastructure, and skilled workforce in supporting Apple's manufacturing needs. Mr Cook said, \"There is confusion about China. And let me at least give you my opinion. The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labour costs. I am not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being a low labour cost country many years ago.\" He further highlighted China's unique advantage in having a large pool of highly skilled workers concentrated in one place. He emphasised that Apple's products require advanced tools and high precision, which China excels in due to its deep tooling expertise. \"The reason is because of the skill, the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill it is. It is like the products we do require really advanced tooling and the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with materials that we do are state-of-the-art,\" he added.

Reacting to the video, one user wrote, \"True, it's about scale, speed, and precision. China has a massive pool of highly skilled tooling and manufacturing engineers. It's not just labor, it's a full ecosystem built over decades, with deep supply chains and rapid turnaround that's hard to replicate elsewhere.\" Another commented, \"Totally agree with Tim. Companies exploited China's cheap labour earlier, but it was China's rapid development of manufacturing tech that took it so ahead of the US and Germany's of the world.\" Notably, Apple relies on the vast manufacturing network in China for the mass production of its iPhone and other devices. In recent times, the company has also shifted its focus to other key markets, including India, to diversify its manufacturing base. India's growing electronics manufacturing ecosystem, coupled with government incentives and a large skilled workforce, makes it an attractive location for Apple to set up production facilities.

First, it has been reported that the Vision Pro 2 is on the way from the Cupertino-based tech giant, which is expected to address latency and compatibility issues. In addition, it is also being reported that a cheaper and lighter version of the Vision Pro is currently in the works. Vision Pro 2 and More Are Coming Soon From Apple Analyst Mark Gurman ( via Bloomberg ) revealed Apple's plans for the future of the Vision Pro lineup. The tech company is said to be now all hands-on deck for its next developments. Two headsets are reportedly in the works that seek to address issues that the original Vision Pro has. First, there will reportedly be a Vision Pro 2 from the company, but it is not what people are expecting. Gurman said that Apple will not jump from the M2 to the M5 but will focus more on offering an ultra-low latency experience that plugs into the Mac in order to access more applications for the headset. On the other hand, there will also reportedly be a cheaper and lighter version of the Vision Pro. Tim Cook Wants to Beat Meta in XR Tech Apart from that, Gurman also revealed that Apple wants to beat Meta at its game, with CEO Tim Cook's intending to develop a pair of AR glasses. This information was reportedly shared by an Apple engineer who claimed that Cook does not care about \"anything else\" other than to develop \"true\" AR glasses with cameras and microphones to gp up against Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses and Project Orion in the future. Apple's Vision Pro The Apple Vision Pro was the talk of the town when Apple first introduced it almost two years ago, centering on a wearable headset packed with significant features. When it was released, the Vision Pro went through the ups and downs as sales faltered after several months, but it still earned accolades along the way, including Popular Science's \" Innovation of the Year .\" Despite its poor performance later on, there is still more to be expected from Apple in their Vision Pro development, with two devices reported to reinforce the lineup . It was previously revealed by Cook that the original Vision Pro was meant for developers, and he defended the original pricing of the headset, saying it was made for those who can afford this early adoption of the device.

This exemption spares U.S. consumers from potential price increases on these widely used products, which are predominantly manufactured in countries like China and India. While this move provides temporary relief for Apple and its customers, it also raises critical questions about the long-term impact of trade policies on global manufacturing strategies and the broader technology sector. The video below from Matt Talks Tech gives us more details about the exemption. Watch this video on YouTube . How Tariff Exemptions Affect Apple and Consumers By excluding Apple products from higher tariffs, the U.S. government has effectively shielded consumers from substantial price hikes. Without this exemption, Apple would likely have passed the increased production costs onto buyers, making its devices significantly more expensive. For example, a high-end iPhone manufactured entirely in the U.S. could cost as much as $3,500, a price point that would render it unaffordable for many consumers. This exemption allows Apple to maintain its current pricing structure, making sure that its devices remain accessible to a broad audience. For consumers, this means continued access to Apple\u2019s products at familiar price points, preserving affordability in a market where rising costs are a constant concern. However, this relief is temporary, as future trade policy changes could still disrupt pricing and availability. Apple\u2019s Global Manufacturing Strategy Apple\u2019s reliance on global manufacturing hubs, particularly in China and India, is a cornerstone of its supply chain. These countries offer access to skilled labor, advanced manufacturing infrastructure, and lower production costs, allowing Apple to produce high-quality devices at competitive prices. While Apple has made investments in U.S.-based facilities, such as its Texas plant for server production and chip-related processes, the company has no immediate plans to shift large-scale iPhone production to the U.S. due to the prohibitive costs involved. This global manufacturing strategy highlights the complexities of balancing cost efficiency with geopolitical and economic pressures. The tariff exemption temporarily alleviates some of these pressures, but it does not resolve the underlying challenges of Apple\u2019s production model. As trade policies evolve, Apple will need to continuously adapt its strategy to maintain its competitive edge while addressing the demands of various stakeholders. Trade Policies and Their Influence on Pricing The tariff exemption underscores the intricate relationship between global trade policies and regional pricing strategies. While U.S. consumers benefit from stable iPhone prices, the situation in other regions remains less predictable. In some markets, Apple may absorb additional costs to maintain competitive pricing, while in others, it might adjust prices upward to offset potential losses caused by tariffs or other economic factors. This uncertainty extends beyond Apple. Competitors like Samsung and Google, which also rely on manufacturing in China, face similar challenges. If tariffs are imposed on their products, they may need to reevaluate their pricing strategies, potentially leading to higher costs for consumers worldwide. This dynamic creates a ripple effect across the consumer electronics market, influencing not only pricing but also innovation and product availability. Competitor Responses and Consumer Implications The tariff exemption for Apple products raises important questions about how competitors will respond. Companies like Samsung and Google, which directly compete with Apple in the smartphone and consumer electronics markets, may be forced to adjust their pricing models if tariffs increase their production costs. This could result in higher prices for a wide range of devices, from smartphones to laptops and wearables. For consumers, the affordability of future devices remains a pressing concern. Speculation about the pricing of upcoming iPhone models, such as the iPhone 17, continues to grow. Many wonder how long Apple can sustain its current pricing structure amid global economic pressures and evolving trade policies. The broader industry faces similar challenges as manufacturers grapple with balancing cost efficiency, competitive pricing, and consumer demand. The Bigger Picture The decision to exempt Apple products from higher tariffs highlights the interconnected nature of trade policies, global manufacturing, and the consumer electronics industry. While U.S. consumers currently benefit from stable prices on Apple devices, the long-term implications for the industry remain uncertain. Companies like Apple must navigate an increasingly complex landscape, balancing production costs, pricing strategies, and consumer affordability to maintain their market positions. As trade policies and economic conditions continue to evolve, the ripple effects will likely shape the future of technology pricing and accessibility worldwide. For now, the exemption provides short-term relief, but it also serves as a reminder of the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead for Apple, its competitors, and the global tech industry.

Social media juggernaut Meta is on trial on Monday. It faces serious US government allegations that it abused its market power to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp before they could become competitors. By moving forward, the trial in a Washington federal court dashes the hopes of Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg that the return of Donald Trump to the White House would see the government let up on the enforcement of antitrust law against Big Tech. The Meta case is being made by the Federal Trade Commission, the powerful US consumer protection agency, and could see the owner of Facebook forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp, which have grown into global powerhouses since their buyout. The trial will be run and decided by Judge James Boasberg, who is also presiding over a high-profile case involving White House orders to deport Venezuelans using wartime law. The case against Meta was originally filed in December 2020, during the first Trump administration, and all eyes were on whether he would ask the FTC to stand down. Zuckerberg, the world\u2019s third-richest person, has made repeated visits to the White House as he tries to persuade the US leader to choose settlement instead of fighting the trial, a decision that would be extraordinary at this late stage. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson played down such a possibility, telling The Verge, \u201cI\u2019d be very surprised if anything like that ever happened.\u201d As part of his lobbying efforts, Zuckerberg contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund and overhauled content moderation policies. He also purchased a $23 million mansion in Washington in what was seen as a bid to spend more time close to the center of political power. \u201cIt would be borderline scandalous if Zuckerberg went to the White House and wound up with a settlement,\u201d Jonathan Kanter, an antitrust enforcer under the Biden administration, told CNBC. The Meta lawsuit represents just one of five major tech antitrust actions recently initiated by the US government. Google is facing two cases and was found guilty of search-market dominance abuse last August, while Apple and Amazon are also heading to court. Zuckerberg, his former lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg, and a long line of executives from rival companies will be taking the stand over a trial expected to last at least eight weeks. Central to the case is Facebook\u2019s 2012 billion-dollar purchase of Instagram \u2014 then a small but promising photo-sharing app that now boasts two billion active users. EXPLAINER: Understanding Trump\u2019s tariff policy \u2014 and what it means for Nigeria Ecuador reelects incumbent Daniel Noboa as president How to boost economic growth \u2013 Agbakoba An email from Zuckerberg cited by the FTC showed him depicting Instagram\u2019s emergence as \u201creally scary,\u201d adding that is \u201cwhy we might want to consider paying a lot of money for this.\u201d The FTC argues Meta\u2019s $19 billion WhatsApp acquisition in 2014 followed the same pattern, with Zuckerberg fearing the messaging app could either transform into a social network or be purchased by a competitor. Meta\u2019s defense attorneys will argue that its substantial investments transformed these acquisitions into the blockbusters they are today. They will also highlight that Meta\u2019s apps are free for users and face fierce competition. The FTC argues that Meta\u2019s monopoly power is demonstrated by a severely downgraded user experience \u2014 with too many ads and product changes that users have no choice but to tolerate. \u2013 Defining the market \u2013 A key courtroom battleground will be how FTC defines Meta\u2019s market. The US government argues that Facebook and Instagram are dominant players in apps that provide a way to connect with family and friends, a category that does not include TikTok and YouTube. But Meta disagrees. \u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe bigger that Meta can make the relevant market\u2026 the more likely it is to defeat the FTC\u2019s case,\u201d said lawyer Brendan Benedict on Substack.

Photograph: Olivier Hoslet/EPA Pat Leahy Mon Apr 14 2025 - 06:00 The first face-to-face meeting between the EU and the United States since the White House imposed tariffs on imports to the US will take place on Monday when EU trade commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d meets commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and US trade officials in Washington, DC. EU countries including Ireland will be watching anxiously for a sign that substantive negotiations with the US to avoid a damaging trade war can begin soon \u2013 but this weekend senior officials in Dublin and Brussels were hopeful, rather than confident of this. Dublin is especially concerned that pharmaceuticals \u2013 which comprise the great bulk of Irish exports to the US \u2013 should be part of the overall negotiations. The EU and Ireland expect that if pharma exports are part of the broader trade negotiations, they are unlikely to be hit with special tariffs, despite repeated threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on the sector soon.

But Ireland is also wary of an EU response that includes a digital services tax on US tech giants \u2013 a move the Taoiseach told The Irish Times he would oppose and which Minister for Public Expenditure Jack Chambers said on Sunday would signal that \u201cwe\u2019re at a point of enormous damage for the Irish economy\u201d. The unpredictability of the US position was further underlined over the weekend when the Trump administration said that it would exempt smartphones, computers and some other electronic goods from its so-called reciprocal tariffs. The exclusions, published late on Friday by US Customs and Border Protection, narrow the scope of the levies by excluding the products from Trump\u2019s 125 per cent China tariff and his baseline 10 per cent global tariff on nearly all other countries \u2013 though the White House later indicated that Chinese products would still face an earlier 20 per cent tariff. The announcement came as a relief to Apple , a major Irish taxpayer which manufactures smartphones in China and which saw its share price plummet last week, knocking more than $600 billion (\u20ac528 billion) off the company\u2019s value. However, Mr Lutnick said on Sunday that the exemption was not permanent and such products would be re-examined as part of a government investigation into semiconductors, which face a separate round of tariffs. Senior EU and Irish sources say they hope that Monday\u2019s meeting can lay the groundwork for detailed negotiations between the EU and the US over the coming months. There is hope on the EU side that concessions to the US, such as easing existing tariffs on US cars and undertaking to purchase more American liquefied natural gas, could pave the way for the Trump administration to claim victory and set aside its EU tariffs. But the unpredictability of President Trump makes any expectations about the future unreliable. It is this uncertainty that is spooking global markets, which will be closely watched on Monday morning for signs of a continuing sell-off in US assets, identified by many analysts last week. Some market analysts say the Trump tariffs \u2013 and the increasingly unilateralist position of the US more generally \u2013 is prompting a retreat from US shares and bonds, a trend that could make financing the US government\u2019s huge deficit more difficult. A move away from US assets could also endanger the position of the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency \u2013 a move that would have far-reaching implications for the global financial system. EU foreign affairs ministers, including T\u00e1naiste Simon Harris , are expected to discuss the US tariffs on the margin of a meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, though the agenda is dominated by Ukraine and Israel-Palestine.

After days of market mayhem, America\u2019s billionaires finally did something this week that few top bosses have done since Donald Trump took office in January: sound off about the US president\u2019s actions. Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs , they said, were a \u201chuge policy mistake\u201d born of \u201cstupidity\u201d that could spark an \u201ceconomic nuclear winter\u201d and in some cases amounted to \u201cbullshit\u201d. Talk about a gear shift. Until this market-melting moment, companies across the US had shown striking levels of deference to Trump\u2019s agenda. READ MORE We called off our wedding because of Fair Deal threat to my home Big stock gains may signal big trouble The Irish man who bought a home in the US after winning $100,000 on NFL fantasy football Everyone wants a piece of the sport chat action It is hard to say if this will change after his tariff backdown, but what is clear is just how hard it is to deal with an administration bent on upending normal rules of business engagement. To start with, there is simple confusion. Last week I spoke to Nneka Chiazor, head of the Public Affairs Council in Washington, a non-partisan association of public affairs professionals from some of the largest US companies. She had just come back from meeting some of her members in Brussels, who peppered her with questions such as: \u201cCan we still say \u2018green\u2019?\u201d; \u201cIs \u2018clean\u2019 still okay?\u201d; \u201cWould it be okay if we participated in [New York] Climate Week?\u201d \u201cPeople are struggling with how to show respect for the US administration\u201d while honouring their commitments to customers and other stakeholders, she said. That struggle is harder when you see how fraught it can be for companies to do a U-turn on measures they once championed that do not chime with the Trump administration. \u201cEveryone looks completely hypocritical and directionless\u201d, said New York University professor Alison Taylor, author of Higher Ground: How Business Can Do the Right Thing in a Turbulent World. \u201cThat has the impact of making anything that they say look completely implausible, which I don\u2019t think is super smart.\u201d Then there is financial risk. The number of shoppers visiting Target stores has fallen for nine weeks in a row since the retailer triggered a customer boycott with a January statement indicating it was pulling back from diversity initiatives it had long promoted, data from the Placer.ai analytics firm shows. In contrast, footfall has kept growing at Costco, which fought a shareholder proposal aimed at undermining its diversity and inclusion initiatives. Correlation is of course not causation. Many other factors could explain the difference. Target\u2019s trust and likeability score \u2013 a chief measure of reputation \u2013 did drop to a four-year low in the first quarter of this year, reckons market intelligence firm Caliber. But the Caliber surveys this is based on show it continues a downward trend that began years before Target\u2019s diversity retreat. Also, Caliber research on 10 big US companies including Target, Walmart and Apple indicates most had little or no change in their trust scores from the last quarter of 2024, regardless of whether they dropped or defended diversity measures. But employee trust is another matter. Consider the hundreds of associates from some of the world\u2019s largest law firms that have signed an open letter condemning the administration\u2019s targeting of firms it opposes. Imagine how they felt when some of their firms then caved in, pledging millions of dollars in pro bono services to administration-approved causes \u2013 a move that seems to have surprised even the president. Firms are saying \u201cWhere do I sign? Where do I sign?\u201d, Trump marvelled at the White House last month. \u201cNobody can believe it.\u201d Perhaps. History suggests companies are rarely at the vanguard of political resistance, no matter how high the stakes get. Dutch journalist David de Jong says that, in the years of research he did for his 2022 book Nazi Billionaires, he came across just two examples of major industrialists or companies defying Nazi Germany. Robert Bosch, founder of the eponymous engineering and technology group, and steel tycoon Fritz Thyssen. Charles Hecker\u2019s 2024 book Zero Sum offers another lesson about the foreign companies that kept doing business in an increasingly authoritarian Russia. In one telling example, a senior European executive reveals these firms\u2019 corporate headquarters were \u201cwagging their fingers\u201d about Moscow\u2019s illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea, while urging their Russian offices to boost sales next year. The US of 2025 is no Russia of 2014, let alone 1930s Germany. All the same, any US company that bends to an administration uncommonly determined to bring its adversaries to heel is following a familiar path. \u2013 Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Donald Trump United States US tariffs IN THIS SECTION Q&A: How will the Government\u2019s new plan to support businesses affect workers?

Not only are the mega-caps bigger than most stocks, they\u2019re also more volatile. As a result, the mag seven account for 40-45 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 25 per cent of ACWI volatility. The gap between the volatility contribution and their market-cap weight is now the widest in 25 years. Looking more closely, Verdad\u2019s figures show Tesla has as much impact on US and global index movements as Microsoft , even though Microsoft is more than three times as valuable. However, the main contributor to investor heartburn is Nvidia. Even though it\u2019s less valuable than Apple and Microsoft, it is responsible for 13 per cent of S&P 500 volatility and 8 per cent of the ACWI\u2019s \u2013 more than twice as much as Apple and Microsoft.

This includes a couple of highly anticipated features including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as the ability to switch the \u201cIce Cream Truck\u201d sound when driving at low speeds. Latest Proton e.MAS 7 OTA update schedule As shared by Pro-Net product expert David Tiah, Proton e.MAS 7 has recently received an April OTA (Over-the-air) update which adds the Start/Stop charging button on the main central display, optimised braking experience and the ability to view the EV\u2019s location when the car is asleep. For those who are waiting for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, he revealed that Wireless Apple CarPlay is coming in the Q2 Update that\u2019s expected to be pushed by July 2025, while Wired Apple CarPlay is coming in Q3 Update (By October 2025). For Android users, Wired and Wireless Android Auto is expected to arrive in Q4 (by December 2025). Other known usability complaints and feedback are also being addressed as well via OTA. Pro-Net will be giving users to change the AVAS (Ice Cream Truck) sound and bug fixes for Radio scan in the Q2 Update which is expected to be pushed by July. Meanwhile, the permanent speed warning sound memory switch will be added in the Q3 Update which is expected to be pushed by October 2025. As announced earlier , Wireless Apple CarPlay was supposed to be delivered by June. When we asked them about the delay, Pro-Net said they are taking a little bit more time for certification and testing to ensure that the feature works well for all users when it is rolled out. Proton e.MAS app to integrate Shell Recharge chargers very soon At the moment, Proton e.MAS 7 users can experience seamless EV charger discovery, activation and payment directly from the Proton e.MAS app. Through the Proton e.MAS app, users can get access to almost 90% of public chargers in the country from various Charge Point Operators (CPO). As a result, there\u2019s no longer a need to download multiple charging apps from every single CPO. After integrating Charge+ and RExcharge chargers last month, Pro-Net Deputy Head of Charging Ahmad Munif Halim reveals that Shell Recharge will soon be integrated in the app. Tags: Android Auto Apple CarPlay Charge Plus Electric Vehicle EV EV Charger EV charging Pro-Net Proton Proton e.Mas 7 Shell Recharge Alexander Wong POPULAR Proton e.MAS 7: Wireless Apple CarPlay and \u201cIce Cream Truck\u201d sound switch coming in July via OTA Update April 14, 2025 MGS5 EV confirmed for Malaysia: Should BYD, Proton be worried?

In a surprise move, the President\u2019s administration officially announced that Trump exempts smartphones tariffs, including the brutal 125% levy that had companies like Apple and Samsung on edge. According to a notice from US Customs and Border Patrol, these devices are now exempt from Trump\u2019s global 10% tariff and the much bigger China-specific import tax. That\u2019s a big deal. Some early estimates suggested that iPhone prices could have tripled if companies like Apple had passed the extra costs on to consumers. The timing of this exemption feels especially critical. Apple, for one, manufactures about 80% of its iPhones for the US market in China. Without relief, they were looking at an impossible situation: either swallow the cost or jack up prices. It\u2019s the same story for Samsung, which has been trying to diversify its supply chain to avoid over-reliance on China, with India and Vietnam stepping in as alternative hubs. Of course, not every tech product is safe. Game consoles, for example, have already felt the squeeze. Nintendo reportedly delayed Switch 2 pre-orders in the US because of these tariffs. Trump\u2019s tariff policy has been aggressive across the board. He raised China-specific import taxes to 145%, blaming Beijing\u2019s 84% retaliatory tariffs for the hike. The White House is spinning this as a negotiating tactic. Trump claims the endgame is fairer trade, fewer supply chain dependencies, and more factories returning to American soil. Whether or not that works is still up for debate. But for now, with Trump exempts smartphones tariffs, US tech companies\u2014and anyone eyeing a new iPhone\u2014can breathe a little easier.

The article has been amended to reflect the new details. MGS5 EV will be making its way to Malaysia with an estimated price tag that starts at RM115,000 . This was revealed during SAIC Motor Malaysia \u2019s media preview session today, which marked the electric SUV\u2019s first official outing in our market. Expected to be a major rival to current market darlings such as Proton e.MAS 7 and BYD Atto 3 Ultra, the MGS5 EV will be available in Malaysia in two main variants. However, the company did not reveal the specific pricing for each variant, which is something that they are saving for the official launch this May. MGS5 EV Malaysia quick specs Built with a rear-wheel drive setup, the MGS5 EV will be making its way to Malaysia with two battery configurations. The base-spec model is powered by a 49kWh LFP battery, which allows the variant to deliver a WLTP-rated range of 340km alongside a DC charging speed of 120kW. On the other hand, the high-spec MGS5 EV for Malaysia is equipped with a 62.2kWh LFP battery. It also has a much higher WLTP-rated range of 430km and supports a DC charging speed of up to 150kW. For the electric motor though, things are slightly unclear. This is because the presentation slide and press release only mentioned the 125kW (168hp) electric motor which also produces 250Nm of torque. However, the presentation slide during the preview event said that the MGS5 EV has a 0-100km/h timing of 6.1 seconds. This figure did not match the century timing for the 125kW motor which is supposed to be around 8 seconds. The 6.1 seconds 0-100km/h timing is supposed to be for the 180kW (242hp) electric motor as per the one that was fitted to the high-spec MGS5 EV in Thailand. We have reached out to SAIC Motor Malaysia\u2019s representative to obtain further clarifications but were told that more details will only be announced during the public launch this May. Meanwhile, both MGS5 EV variants do share a lot of features with each other. They include the 6.6kW AC charging, Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) capability, a 12.8-inch infotainment display, a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster, wireless Apple CarPlay & Android Auto, MG Pilot Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), and 7 airbags. The electric SUV also supports the MG iSMART mobile app that allows owners to remotely lock or unlock their car, check its location and charging status, as well as control the climate settings. You can also use the app to transform your phone into a digital key for the EV. At the same time, the high-spec MGS5 EV also has a long list of extra features. Among them include 18-inch alloy wheels, a panoramic sunroof, a powered tailgate, MG perforated pattern on the seats, a heated leather steering wheel, a power-adjustable driver\u2019s seat, 6 premium audio speakers, rear reading lamps, rain-sensing wipers and a 360-degree surround-view camera. In terms of colourways, the MGS5 EV in Malaysia includes Arctic White, Monument Silver, Camden Grey, and Dynamic Red as well as the Elegant Latte which is reserved for the high-spec model. The electric SUV comes standard with a dark interior as well as seats made out of a leather and fabric combination.

According to claims by a seasoned journalist, the Cupertino-based technology giant's next iteration of iPadOS, i PadOS 19 , could make the iPad operating system more like macOS. With several iPad models getting an upgrade to the latest M4 chipset, Apple is reportedly gearing up to focus on delivering more productivity and improving the multitasking capabilities of its tablets. iPadOS 19 Overhaul This information comes from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. In the latest edition of the Power On newsletter , the journalist claims that revamping the iPadOS software will be one of the key agendas during the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) 2025, which kicks off on June 9. With recent upgrades to iPad models, hardware capabilities of the tablets have left behind its software. So far, the iPad OS has been an extension of iOS , offering similar features adapted to a larger screen size. However, users have been asking for more \u2014 more features, more multitasking capabilities, and more productivity. And it seems like Apple will finally listen. As per Gurman, the iPhone maker is aiming to make the iPad operate more like a Mac. Moto Book 60 Laptop, Moto Pad 60 Pro Tablet to Debut on This Date With iPadOS 19, it is said to focus on improving productivity, multitasking and app window management. This report contradicts more context to past information by the same journalist who suggested that Apple's next-generation iPhone, iPad, and Mac OS versions would focus more on delivering visual changes than adding new features. Previous claims by Gurman suggest that the company will minimise the visual differences across devices such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and the Apple Vision Pro and deliver a more cohesive experience. Thus, its operating systems may come with user interface (UI) elements akin to visionOS, the OS powering the spatial headset. While official details remain scarce, one of the rumoured changes is glass effects throughout the UI. Oppo Pad 4 Pro Launched With Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, 12,140mAh Battery Apple's iPad Fold and iPhone Fold Could Launch Next Year As per the journalist, Apple aims to eliminate differences in system actions such as hamburger menus and menu buttons, the menu bar, and button for closing applications. Some applications are suggested to get reworked to aid a new generation of users in better understanding their devices.

Upgrade Now Morning Bid: Doing the tariff two-step German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt \u00b7 Reuters Reuters Sun, Apr 13, 2025, 9:33 PM 3 min read (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Wayne Cole So the \"reciprocal\" tariffs are off smartphones and some electronics, but maybe only for a while as they could get their own special tariff once the White House has completed a study of the global supply chain. Or something. Indeed, Trump on Sunday told reporters tariffs on semiconductors would be announced over the next week and a decision on phones made \"soon\". Essentially more of the same chaos. How anyone running a company can decide on long-term investments in such conditions is a mystery, which has limited the boost to Wall Street futures for the moment. The S&P 500 was up around 0.8% and the Nasdaq 1.2%, though you would have to assume Apple shares, at least, will benefit in the near term. European stock futures have actually performed better, perhaps on speculation that President Trump will blink on other levies, too. Or it could be investors are buying Europe now that U.S. exceptionalism and \"exorbitant privilege\" - the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency - are under such threat. The dollar is certainly feeling unloved, falling back under 143.00 yen and extending last week's 5% slide on the Swiss franc. The euro is knocking on $1.1400 again and even the high-beta Aussie and kiwi are up, a sure sign the dollar's safe-haven status is in jeopardy. Apparently, Japanese officials are gearing up for trade negotiations with the United States that will likely touch on currency policy, with some officials privately bracing for Washington to call on Tokyo to prop up the yen. Should the White House actively start talking the dollar down, it will spook those offshore investors with unhedged positions in U.S. assets - which is most of them. At least Treasuries are steadier, though they show little sign of reversing last week's astonishing 50-basis-point jump in longer-term yields. If sustained, that's a material tightening in financial conditions and a deadweight for the housing market, adding another reason for the Fed to ease even if inflation is heading higher. It will be interesting to see if the New York Fed survey of inflation expectations due later on Monday shows the same kind of spike seen in the University of Michigan numbers. Retail sales data for March on Wednesday could be strong as consumers rushed to buy autos and other goods before the tariffs go into effect. Fed Chair Powell also has a chance to provide his outlook on Wednesday at the Economic Club of Chicago, where the Q&A should be lively. Markets imply a 20% chance of a May rate cut, rising to almost 80% for June. Some 80 basis points of easing are priced in for the year, though that was up around 130 basis points this time last week.

The response has been chaotic. Companies like Framework, which specializes in modular laptops, and Nintendo, with its game consoles, were hit especially hard. Framework had to pause sales of some laptop models in the US . Nintendo also delayed pre-orders of the recently announced Switch 2 , in order to \"assess the potential impact of tariffs.\" As the backlash grew, the Trump administration pulled back slightly by announcing exemptions for key electronics like smartphones, laptops, memory cards, and semiconductors. Now, reports indicate the exemption of smartphones, laptops, and other electronics will be short-lived. CNN highlighted comments made by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick during an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week, where he stated that the exemptions will be short-lived, with new tariffs targeting electronics already in the works. You can read the full transcript here . Hours later, Trump made a post on Truth Social , where he claimed that no such exemptions exist, as products like smartphones and laptops remain subject to existing tariffs, specifically the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs. NOBODY is getting \u201coff the hook\u201d for the unfair Trade Balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other Countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst! There was no Tariff \u201cexception\u201d announced on Friday. These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff \u201cbucket.\u201d The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations. What has been exposed is that we need to make products in the United States, and that we will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China, which will do everything within its power to disrespect the American People. We also cannot let them continue to abuse us on Trade, like they have for decades, THOSE DAYS ARE OVER! The Golden Age of America, which includes the upcoming Tax and Regulation Cuts, a substantial amount of which was just approved by the House and Senate, will mean more and better paying Jobs, making products in our Nation, and treating other Countries, in particular China, the same way they have treated us. The bottom line is that our Country will be bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The Trump administration hopes that the tariffs will make the US less reliant on countries like China in terms of manufacturing . Industry executives like Apple CEO Tim Cook have reiterated that manufacturing in China is not because of cheap labour, but due to a shortage of skilled labour elsewhere, a sentiment that Elon Musk also shares.

SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. Reuters TSMC , the main global producer of advanced chips used in artificial intelligence applications, is set to report a 54% leap in first-quarter profit on Thursday, though is also likely to flag risk from trade policies of U.S. President Donald Trump. The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple and Nvidia, has benefited from a trend towards implementing AI features in online products. But the firm faces headwind not just from Trump's import tariffs but also his criticism of Taiwan's dominance of the chip industry. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is set to report net profit of T$347.8 billion ($10.74 billion) for the three months through March 31, according to a LSEG SmartEstimate drawn from 17 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weighting to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate. That estimate compares to the 2024 first-quarter net profit of T$225.5 billion. TSMC has been spending billions of dollars on new factories overseas, though it said most manufacturing will remain in Taiwan. It announced a $100 billion investment with Trump at the White House last month, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants in the U.S. state of Arizona. Live Events Trump has both praised Taiwan's chip industry and threatened it with tariffs. Discover the stories of your interest Blockchain 5 Stories Cyber-safety 7 Stories Fintech 9 Stories E-comm 9 Stories ML 8 Stories Edtech 6 Stories Last week, he said he had told TSMC it would have to pay a tax of up to 100% if it did not build factories in the U.S. On Sunday, he said the exclusion of smartphones and computers from tariffs on China will be short-lived, pledging a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector. \"The company will likely double down on overseas fab investments to mitigate the geopolitical risk, despite two to three percentage points of gross margin dilution for the next five years,\" said SemiAnalysis analyst Sravan Kundojjala. \"This will likely ensure TSMC gets favourable treatment from the U.S. government and minimise the tariff burden.\" Apple's iPhones, given they are mainly made in China, is another risk area for TSMC, said Cathay Futures analyst Venson Tsai. \"If the iPhone can't be sold, then TSMC's chips can't either,\" Tsai said. TSMC last week reported a surge in first-quarter revenue in Taiwan dollars, slightly ahead of market expectations. The company gives its revenue outlook in U.S. dollars on its quarterly earnings call, scheduled for 0600 GMT on Thursday. It will also update its outlook for the current quarter as well as for the full year, including planned capital expenditure for production increases. On its last earnings call in January, TSMC said it expected capital spending this year to be $38 billion to $42 billion, an increase of as much as 41% from last year.

Edward Moyer Senior Editor Ed is a many-year veteran of the writing and editing world who enjoys taking sentences apart and putting them back together. He also likes making them from scratch. For nearly a quarter of a century, he's edited and written stories about various aspects of the technology world, from the US National Security Agency's controversial spying techniques to historic NASA space missions to 3D-printed works of fine art.

See full bio Edward Moyer April 12, 2025 12:49 p.m. PT 2 min read James Martin/CNET Another twist in the tariff saga: Smartphones , laptops and other consumer electronics may not see soaring prices due to tariffs after all, at least for the time being. Late Friday, the Trump administration exempted such products from the reciprocal tariffs it had imposed earlier, including the 125% fees levied on imports from China, where many tech and electronics products are manufactured. A notice to shippers posted late Friday by US Customs and Border Protection included a list of tariff codes for product categories that won't be subject to the fees. Code 8471 covers computers, laptops, disc drives and automatic data processing, Reuters reported . Flat panel displays, memory chips and semiconductors will also sidestep the tariff fees, the news outlet said. Industry observers had feared massive price hikes on tech and other gear as a result of tariffs, and concerns had prompted some consumers to rush to buy iPhones and other products. Apple Store employees saw an uptick in foot traffic last weekend, with one worker telling Bloomberg that the surge felt like the holiday shopping season. It's unclear whether the exemption will stay in place, however, with both Bloomberg and The New York Times reporting that different tariff fees may end up affecting electronics equipment down the line. What this means for you If your head's spinning over all the back-and-forth tariff developments, you're definitely not alone. What does it mean for the prices you'll see when crossing things off your shopping list? The short answer is: Don't be surprised if you wind up paying more for at least some goods and services. For details, you can check out our Tariffs Explained piece. And before this latest news, we asked CNET experts to give us their best predictions and advice when it comes to shopping for tech products like laptops, phones, TVs and more. See their responses in our Buy or Wait guide. Although a CNET survey showed that some people are rushing to buy tech gear before anticipated price rises, experts caution against busting out the credit card. If you already had your eye on a particular product and you'd set aside the money for it, buying now, or during an upcoming sale, could help you save money. It could also help you breathe a little easier. But again, be wary of taking on debt. Find out more here .

TODAY'S BEST DEALS Check Amazon Check Walmart Pros + Charges with a standard AC cable (Not IEC) + Great ports + Integrated handle + Built-in light ring + Brand trust Cons - No companion app - Only 800W Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you\u2019re buying the best. Find out more about how we test. Jump to: Price and Availability Unboxing & first impressions Design & build quality In use Final verdict Duracell has been around for as long as I can remember. I've got countless memories of grabbing some Duracell batteries to throw in toys, remotes, and other tools growing up, all the way up to toys for my kids. Duracell is a well-known, highly-reputable company that people recognize and trust. Having reviewed the best portable power stations , I can confidently say this one is meant for everyday use, has excellent ports, and is a simple backup for essentials. However, what sets this power station apart is not the bold design, port offering, power output, or capacity. What sets this apart is that you can recharge it with a standard AC extension cord. There is no fancy proprietary charger or IEC cable that swears on the cable that you can only use for that power station. Any AC extension cable will do.

They offer a smaller variant, but if you're going with this company, I'd choose this larger one for portable power stations. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) Duracell G800: Unboxing & first impressions When I first found the Duracell G800, I thought it was a gimmick. A power station resembling a famous battery wouldn't work well. But, once I got it, I was proven wrong. The build quality is excellent, the packaging is professional and straightforward, the handle is comfortable to carry, the port offering is fantastic, and then I noticed the way to charge, and I realized this is working hard to compete right out of the gate. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) Duracell G800: Design & build quality Specs Battery Capacity: 620Wh Output: 800W (shared across 3 AC ports) Ports: \u2022 3x AC Outlets (total 800W shared) \u2022 3x USB-A (7.2A shared) \u2022 2x USB-C (100W per port, 200W total) \u2022 1x Car charger port (120W max) Weight: 19.4 lbs Dimensions: 12.5\u201d x 8.3\u201d x 11.5\u201d The Duracell G800 is a unique look. It's got a bronze top half to resemble the famous battery, but what's great is that Duracell chose to make the line between the black and copper a ring light, helping light whatever you may be trying to plug in, in the dark, without power, thus the need for a power station. Further, the handle is solid and firm, and there is some integrated storage on the backside of the power station to help carry the power cable or any USB-C/USB-A cables. Thankfully, all the main ports are on the front, which I appreciate. It makes for a portable power station that is easy to use, allowing for this to be set down and forgotten about while charging whatever you may be keeping charged. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) Duracell G800: In use Admittedly, I've had this G800 for around 160 days. However, in that time, I've had my team put this thing to the test in real-life scenarios. I've had this power station help out when charging cameras on the go out of the back of my Jeep, charging iPads and computers on a long trip, and being a light source and emergency power in a power outage. I've had this power station help out my family in Florida during the crazy hurricanes this last year. In all the scenarios, this power station functioned great. The handle makes it easy to maneuver in all of these environments, and the forward-facing ports mean that all ports are accessible simultaneously. Throughout my time testing, the most standout feature is that this unit recharges with a standard AC extension cord outlet. One thing that makes a power station less usable is when it has a proprietary charger or a unique charger that works only for that unit. It makes recharging more cumbersome, more challenging in many ways, and more expensive if you ever damage or misplace your charger. With Duracell, they chose to go the opposite route of an Apple with the (late) Lightning cable, and they decided to go with a cable option that is nearly everywhere (in the US). This may be an intentional move, or it's beginner's luck; regardless, I am a fan. (Image credit: Collin Probst // Future) While testing, I got this power station recharged to an impressive 80 percent in about an hour, just as Duracell suggests. I got my 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro fully recharged about 8.5 times, depending on just how heavily I ran it when plugged in (I run my computers hard with all that I do in a day). Duracell promotes being able to run a Wi-Fi router for around 26 hours, a TV (very generic) for 5 hours, a mini cooler for 22 hours, a drone for 26 charges, and lights for 6.7 hours. If you want to extend your off-grid power, plug in a G-Solar Panel to recharge the power station directly from the sun.

Sadly, it does not have app control, but it does have nice features such as a built-in light ring and that handy ability to recharge with a simple standard AC extension cord.

Marathon Closed Alpha Begins In April, Here's How To Sign Up Want to try the next game from Halo and Destiny developer Bungie? Now's your chance. By Eddie Makuch on April 12, 2025 at 11:00AM PDT 2 Comments Where to buy Marathon There are currently no available deals GameSpot may get a commission from retail offers. As part of the Bungie's reveal showcase for its next game, Marathon, the studio announced a closed alpha test and confirmed how players can sign up for access. The Marathon closed alpha starts later this month, and players can join the Marathon Discord channel for a chance to get in. Bungie said its teams will be \"actively engaging\" with the Discord channel, including conducting live Q&As and generally discussing the project directly with fans. Marathon is a team-based extraction shooter. It's a successor of sorts to Bungie's 1994 game of the same name. Whereas Bungie today is better known for its work on the Destiny and Halo franchises, the original Marathon was one of Bungie's first big successes when it was released for Mac and Apple Pippin. Marathon 2: Durandal followed in 1995, with Marathon Infinity coming in 1996. It wasn't until 2001 that Bungie truly broke out in a major way with the debut of Halo: Combat Evolved. Sony now owns Bungie, but the new Marathon is in the works for platforms beyond the PS5 alone, including Xbox Series X|S and PC--cross-play is supported across all platforms. Marathon will mark Bungie's first big new release since Sony acquired the company in 2022. Marathon launches on September 23 , the same day as Borderlands 4.

In it, she details publicly for the first time the sexual assault she experienced from her father, who also abused her sister and nephew. Speaking to Paula Bennett on her NZ Herald podcast Ask Me Anything , Mau said a lot of people have told her they are surprised by her story, but she doesn\u2019t think they should feel that way as it is \u201cso common\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ll have heard that statistic, one in three women, one in seven men experience sexual harm in their lifetime \u2013 and these are official police figures. \u201c[That\u2019s] 930,000 New Zealanders have experienced, not necessarily exactly what I experienced, but some kind of sexual harm in their lifetime. It\u2019s almost a million people. \u201cSo the surprising thing is not that it happened at all. The surprise comes from the fact that we don\u2019t talk about it enough. It is, I believe, the last big taboo subject in our society. And it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Advertisement Advertise with NZME. She said that is why she wrote the book, because these conversations need to be had and should be had. \u201cIf you think 10 or 15 years ago, we were, as a society, not able to talk about domestic violence. And then a bunch of incredibly committed women have worked over that time to change that around completely and make it a national conversation that we can have to the point where one of the biggest retailers in the country sponsors women\u2019s refuge. \u201cI believe we can do that with sexual harm as well.\u201d Mau has spoken to hundreds of sexual harm survivors, men and women, and said they often speak of a level of shame or self-blame. She said she was able to apply that to herself when telling her story. Mau is now working on a charity, Tika, to help victims get legal support. She is launching it with barrister Zoe Lorton and it is a concept they have been working on since 2018. When they started exploring the issue, they found that only 7% of sexual harm victims report their case, and the figure had not changed in a decade. \" I naively had assumed that all the awareness-raising would move the needle on that, and it hadn\u2019t.\" Tika, when it launches later this year, is an online platform that will allow victims to input details about their perpetrator and get connected with a lawyer to find out what their legal route forwards is. Advertisement Advertise with NZME. \" It\u2019s a game changer. Do you know that you cannot, even at this point, report sexual harm online? You have to walk into a police station or phone and speak to a uniformed officer at the front desk. \u201cWhen you think about the generations of my children\u2019s age and younger, they do everything on their phone. \u201cSo being able to offer a secure platform that they can trust, that will tell them whether anybody else has been harmed by the same person, even just that step is incredibly powerful for somebody who\u2019s been unsure about what to do, but in the back of their mind, they know they\u2019re looking for some kind of accountability and justice.\u201d Listen to the full episode for more from Ali Mau about sharing her story and how she wants to help victims, as well as reflections on her broadcasting career, her public relationship and subsequent divorce from Simon Dallow, and how it felt to be outed.

Inconsistencies may occur. \u2716 President Donald Trump 's decision to exempt many electronics from newly implemented tariffs has sparked surprise from critics, with some citing recent remarks by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to quip about the latest scaling back of the controversial economic policy. Newsweek reached out to the White House and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for comment on Saturday. Why It Matters Earlier this week, Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs went into effect for several hours before he paused most of them for 90 days\u2014with the notable exception of China. The United States and China remain in a tit-for-tat trade war, with Trump hiking the 104 percent tariffs on China to 125 percent on Wednesday after Beijing hit back at the U.S. with an 84 percent additional levy earlier in the day. Trump's total tariffs now stand at 145 percent on Chinese goods, while China has imposed a 125 percent tariff, dismissing Trump's strategy as \"a joke.\" As recently as last Sunday, Lutnick said that tariffs would allow smartphone manufacturing to happen in the U.S., instead of abroad. But the Friday announcement of the electronics exemption suggests manufactures will no longer have the immediate incentive to consider producing smartphones and other electronics in the U.S. What to Know A Friday evening update from CBP exempted smartphones, computer monitors and various electronic parts from the tariffs. The decision was retroactive to as early as April 5. The exemption list includes products the U.S. heavily relies on for overseas production, with limited domestic manufacturing capacity and high consumer demand. Companies such as Apple , which carries out 90 percent of its iPhone manufacturing in China, are set to benefit from the exemptions. \"Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday,\" analysts at Wedbush said in a statement, CNN reported. \"A big step forward for US tech to get these exemptions and the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend.\" While tech companies may be breathing a sigh of relief, some critics of Trump's tariffs took to X, formerly Twitter , on Saturday to joke about the decision and remind their followers of the administration's own words regarding the tariffs.

Now, suddenly he's backtracking again and adding a bunch of exemptions to his reciprocal tariffs. And MAGA is cheering yet again. It's almost as if he has no idea what he's doing and MAGA doesn't stand for anything except whatever Trump says and does.\" Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman and prominent Trump critic, wrote on X: \"More exemptions, so the question remains: If tariffs are so great, why so many exemptions?\" MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle on X: \"So these exemptions on electronics from China... Is this how we should see it?

At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.\" China's Finance Ministry, in a statement: \"The U.S. escalation of tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China's legitimate rights and interests and seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system.\" What Happens Next? The exemptions are already in effect. Tensions between Washington and Beijing remain high, with no sign that other tariffs will be reduced anytime soon. Many other nations are reportedly in the process of negotiating with the Trump administration during the ongoing 90-day pause announced this week. fairness meter fairness meter Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.

Todd is the guest on this week\u2019s edition of Mediaite\u2019s new Press Club podcast , hosted by Aidan McLaughlin , to discuss the media, the news of the day, and life after NBC News, which he left in January after nearly two decades. In the episode, now out on YouTube and podcast platforms, McLaughlin asked Todd about Trump\u2019s tariffs and the resulting stock market roller coaster this week: AIDAN MCLAUGHLIN: Trump finally consummated his decades-long flirtation with tariffs. Have you looked at your portfolio this week? CHUCK TODD: I\u2019m over 50, I\u2019m having to look at it every hour. No, I mean, and that\u2019s this, that\u2019s the dirty little, you know what I took his biggest political problem, is that when you\u2019re of a certain age, you start looking at this every day. You know, this whole, \u201cwell people don\u2019t look at the stock market every day.\u201d. Yeah, but the people who are most likely to vote in midterms, they do. They pay attention to if the Social Security office is taking their phone calls. Like, he is rattling constituencies that are the ones that are most likely to show up to vote. Right? So it\u2019s just one of those, you\u2019re like, this is why this could be politically catastrophic. AIDAN MCLAUGHLIN: So yeah, so we\u2019re in very much uncharted territory right now. CHUCK TODD: And then some. Todd went on to explain why the chaotic tariff roll-out could be Trump\u2019s \u201cAfghanistan moment\u201d \u2014 a reference to the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that led to a collapse of former President Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings, a collapse he never recovered from. He explained: Afghanistan became a competency question. And I think this tariff business for Trump becomes a competency question. \u2018Wait a minute, you went about this all wrong and you caused an economic tsunami. We agree we needed to do it, but you don\u2019t know how to do.\u2019 And in some ways, competency is actually more lethal here than the ideological distinction between the two. And this is why I think he\u2019s probably never going to be over \u2014 barring some we don\u2019t know, rallying around the president because we\u2019re in war or something like this \u2014 I don\u2019t if he ever gets over 45 [percent approval rating] again.

It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia. US Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145 per cent tariffs levied on China or the 10 per cent baseline tariffs elsewhere. It\u2019s the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. The goal is to encourage more domestic manufacturing. But the exemptions seem to acknowledge that the current electronics supply chain is virtually all in Asia and it will be challenging to shift that to the US. For example, about 90 per cent of iPhones are produced and assembled in China, according to Wedbush Securities. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing US Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Trump previously said he would consider exempting some companies from tariffs. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment early Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

Reuters reports that the company, which makes phone cases, power banks, adapters, cables, and more, raised prices on a fifth of its products since Thursday. The move comes as the company passes the cost of US tariffs onto its US-based customers. Some 127 Anker products have seen an average increase of 18% since Thursday last week, with the majority of those occurring after Monday, April 7, when U.S. President Donald Trump added an extra 50% import duty on Chinese goods, according to data from e-commerce services provider SmartScout. Reuters notes that, on an investor call earlier in the week, Anker had said that it was able to raise prices \u201cas it had bargaining power and because its rivals were mainly Chinese and under similar tariff pressure, but did not provide specifics.\u201d Ultimately, more companies could well choose to follow suit. Tariffs make it more costly for companies to bring goods from specific countries into the United States. One way that those companies can negate the additional costs while protecting their profits is to increase prices, effectively passing the cost of the tariffs onto customers. The result is that US-based customers pay more for products as a result of the tariffs that were imposed by its leaders.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

While President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would delay many of the market-shaking tariffs that he\u2019d announced the previous week, he kept a universal baseline 10% tariff in place, while also increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% (on top of a 20% tariff that he\u2019d already imposed on goods from China). There\u2019s been plenty of speculation about what the tariffs will mean for the tech industry , which manufactures many consumer electronics in China and elsewhere abroad. One of Trump\u2019s stated goals is to bring manufacturing back to the United States, but others believe the dream of an American-made iPhone is a fantasy . Those debates may be paused after Friday evening, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection posted a list of product categories that are \u201cexcluded from the reciprocal tariffs imposed under Executive Order 14257,\u201d with the exclusions backdated to April 5. Those categories appear to include smartphones, laptops, hard drives, and semiconductors. Those products will all be exempt from both the 125% tariff on goods from China, as well as the universal baseline tariff. (Other tariffs, such as the previous 20% tariff on Chinese goods, would presumably still apply.) Notable Silicon Valley figures led by Elon Musk have joined the Trump administration, while other tech CEOs have been courting Trump, most visibly with millions of dollars donated to his inauguration. Those efforts seemed to bear little fruit \u2014 until last night\u2019s announcement, which Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, described as \u201ca dream scenario for tech investors.\u201d Tech giants like Apple and Nvidia are likely celebrating the news, as are U.S. consumers who will avoid a big markup on their next iPhone. But the industry could still be hit with more targeted tariffs and other restrictions. For example, The New York Times reports that the Trump administration is preparing a national security-related investigation into semiconductors. And indeed, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that these products would be included in \u201cthe semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two.\u201d This post has been updated with Howard Lutnick\u2019s comments about the tariffs.

The fourth season finale episode, now the last of the series, will get a new ending next week. by Wes Davis Apr 12, 2025, 5:11 PM UTC Link Facebook Threads Rob McIlhenney and Charlotte Nicdao in Mythic Quest. Image: Apple Wes Davis is a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. Mythic Quest, the Apple TV Plus comedy about a game studio, isn\u2019t getting a fifth season, reports Variety . And, like a developer issuing a farewell patch, Apple is updating the final episode of season four with a new \u201cgoodbye\u201d ending next week. Variety published a statement from Mythic Quest \u2019s executive producers: \u201cEndings are hard. But after four incredible seasons, \u2018Mythic Quest\u2019 is coming to a close,\u201d said series executive producers Megan Ganz, David Hornsby, and Rob McElhenney. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud of the show and the world we got to build\u2014and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it. To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Apple\u2019s blessing we made one final update to our last episode\u2014so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.\u201d The news comes just weeks after a report that Apple has been losing $1 billion a year on TV Plus. The show just wrapped up its fourth season and released a f our-episode spinoff called Side Quest on March 26th. One of the early Apple TV Plus shows, Mythic Quest tells the story of Mythic Quest Studios, a fictional games studio led by Ian Grimm, Rob McElhenney\u2019s parody of a visionary tech founder bro, and Charlotte Nicdao\u2019s Poppy Li, an awkward but brilliant engineer who serves as his co-creative director. Throughout the series, Mythic Quest sent up the tech industry, from lampooning startup culture to raising some of the gaming world\u2019s darker ethical questions . But to echo an early Verge write-up of Mythic Quest , you don\u2019t need to understand any of that to enjoy the show. Mythic Quest also stars David Hornsby, Ashly Burch, Imani Hakim, Danny Pudi, Jessie Ennis, Naomi Ekperigin, Andrew Friedman, and Michael Naughton.

See Full Bio MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle (MSNBC screenshot) MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle appeared with her old hosting partner Ali Velshi on Saturday morning to weigh in on a major announcement from Donald Trump's administration on Chinese imports. In a bulletin posted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection late Friday, the administration announced smartphones, computers, and assorted electronics would be exempt from the ruinous 145% percent tariffs imposed on other Chinese products. As Ruhle, a former hedge fund trader put it, \"This is huge.\" Speaking with Velshi, she elaborated, \"So just imagine all the big electronics that we get that's manufactured in China , right? Chips, semiconductors, TVs, cell phones \u2013\u2013 all the big electronics out there are now going to be tariff-free. I mean, Ali, this is extraordinary.\" \"It's kind of like saying we're going to impose 100 plus percent tariffs on everything we buy from China, except for what we actually buy from them,\" she dryly quipped. \"It's sort of crazy because we haven't even started negotiating, you know, this trade war and already we're making this announcement.\" \"It's mind-blowing i n that in the last week what have we done,\" she added. \"The president announced the moves on tariff, we saw the stock market crater, we saw the bond market get whacked, which is the most concerning because it means people don't have faith in the U.S.\". \"We saw consumer confidence absolutely crater and businesses big and small fall into an absolute panic, given what an enormous trading partner China is, but also countries around the world, but focusing just on china, man, if you are [ Apple head] Tim Cook or the other big tech CEO's who gave big and went to Trump's inauguration, you are glad you did that,\" she observed.

A flexible drain snake that'll get out all those clumps of hair and gunk so the bathtub stops filling up past your ankles every time you shower. Just stick it down the drain, twist it, and the ridges at the end will catch all the goop, making sure it all comes out. Amazon, www.amazon.com This pack contains a reusable handle and five single-use heads that you just remove and dispose of after handling your clogged pipes. Promising review: \"Wow. Best thing ever. Seriously. I have had tweezers and sticks and plumbers and chemicals trying to get my master sink to drain. Plumber even said I need an entirely new faucet to get the drain plug part because they don't sell those separately. Well, I have two sinks, a tub, and shower that all match so that was not a valid solution. Doubt I can find the same model. So I bought this thing, stuffed it down, and pulled up hair and black muck. Did it about eight times quickly, ran the water, went right down the drain. Seriously. This is the best tool ever and the best $20 I have ever spent. Everyone with a sink needs this tool. Seriously.\" \u2014 juliejules Get a five-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in other sets and styles). 2. A pack of 120 retainer cleaner tablets because it turns out your Invisalign is supposed to be ~clear~ (it also works on mouthguards and dentures!). All you do is drop a tablet into warm tap water, let your dental device soak for a few minutes, and voila! \u2014 it'll kill bacteria and remove the buildup that's causing discoloration and unpleasant odors. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I really loved this product. I am currently waiting for a new Invisalign set. My old Invisalign needed to be cleaned. I read the reviews and decided to purchase. OMG, it worked! They had a fresh taste and were clean. I wish I had found this product sooner. I did let them soak overnight only because I had been wearing them for the last four months. Nothing happened to Invisalign; there was no weakness or anything. Just very clean and fresh. If I could have given the product 10 stars, I would have. \" \u2014 Lisa R. Get 120 tablets from Amazon for $18.81 (available in five pack sizes). 3. A new pair of workout leggings to replace the super pilled ones you wear three times a week. They're made with a thick, buttery soft fabric (no one is seeing those hot pink undies) and have ~pockets~ so you don't have to carry your phone around the gym. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"THESE...are the best leggings I have ever worn in my entire life! They are so smooth and comfortable. Soft as butter. They fit perfectly. It almost feels like you're naked but they feel somehow insulated and cozy. Stretchy and made of amazingly durable quality. I need to get more colors!\" \u2014 Alexandra Shick Get them from Amazon for $24.98 (available in women's sizes XS\u2013XXL, in three inseam lengths, and 45 colors). 4. A pack of AirPods cleaning putty because it's so embarrassing when you want to share earbuds with someone, but yours are coated in wax and dust. Plus, it's soooo satisfying to squish the lil' square into your speaker and see all the gunk it pulls out \u2014 and then you get to enjoy clearer, louder-sounding music! www.amazon.com Before you toss your tech in the trash, at least give this a try. Promising review: \"I never usually write reviews but this is an exception. I've had my AirPods for over a year and when the sound quality was diminishing, I was afraid they had a short life expectancy and I would need to get a new pair! Even after using cotton buds to clean the AirPods out, I thought that was enough until my friend said there's stuff built up and hard to see, but there was nothing able to get it out! Enter this product. It literally took five minutes to clean each ear bud effectively and instantly the sound quality was as good as new! Loud, clear, less trouble connecting to my phone, etc. You don't need a full square to clean them, so you can pull a piece off or reuse a square with a side you haven't used! SO happy I found a solution!\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get 24 squares from Amazon for $15.99 (available in two pack sizes). 5. A veggie chopper for keeping your counter tidy while speeding up your prep time. If you love to cook but hate chopping (who doesn\u2019t, right?), this thing is a lifesaver. It chops just about everything \u2014 onions, peppers, zucchinis, potatoes, you name it! Plus, it comes with different blades for slicing, dicing, and even spiraling your favorite veggies. www.amazon.com , Amazon Check out a TikTok of the veggie chopper in action. Promising review: \"If you cook, you need this product! I have had this chopper since 2018 and it is by far my favorite kitchen purchase. I have used it hundreds of times over the years and it has held up great. I just bought my MIL one for Christmas and she already loves how much easier it has made meal prep . It is well made and I like that there are different attachments and sizes. I would recommend this chopper!\" \u2014 Steph Get it from Amazon for $23.99+ (available in five colors and five sets). 6. A pack of two antimicrobial \"flossing toothbrushes\" because your current one looks like it was used to scrub the bathroom floor (no offense). This has dual-layered bristles: regular ones and ultra-long, thin flossing bristles that get *deep* in between your teeth and gums. Reviewers are saying it feels like they got their teeth cleaned at the dentist, but nope! \u2014 just this very innovative toothbrush. Emma Lord / BuzzFeed Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, specializing in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed for deeper cleans. Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord has to say: \"I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.\" Promising review: \"I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth \u2014 it definitely gets between the teeth and also, more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck, and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!\" \u2014 Jason A. Get a pair from Amazon for $9.99 . 7. A WD-40 pen if your squeaky cabinets are driving you up the wall. It's way less messy than traditional spray methods, and reviewers love the precision this pen offers \u2014 perfect for getting into tight spaces and silencing those squeaks once and for all. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I love WD-40 products and use them for everything. I spray on shovels to keep dirt or snow from sticking, spray around windows and thresholds to deter bugs, clean Sharpies off wood and walls, and, of course, stop squeaky doors. These small direct-point application pens are great. Keep one in the glove box, my kitchen 'junk' drawer, and the house toolbox.\" \u2014 BBP623 Get a three-pack from Amazon for $12.99 . 8. A wall-mounted organizer to handle those annoying brooms, mops, rakes, and shovels that are always falling over. This rack has five slots and can hold up to 38 pounds, so it\u2019ll keep everything neatly stored and off the floor. www.amazon.com It comes with screws, anchors, a drilling template, and a guide \u2014 everything you'll need to set this up. Promising review: \"Perfect! Exactly what I needed to organize my mop, broom, scoop, etc. Efficient and easy to use. A little hard to get my scoop into it, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s thicker than the rest of the items. Love that there are hooks. Spray bottles and cleaning product bottles hang perfectly on there too.\" \u2014 Kavita Chandanie Get it from Amazon for $13.99 (available in two sizes and two colors). 9. A set of double-sided shower rings that make changing your shower curtain or liner easier than it's ever been. Since you hang the curtain on one side and the liner on the other, you'll avoid the hassle of taking the whole thing down every time you switch the curtain/liner. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This is one of those items you didn\u2019t know you needed, and once you get it, you can\u2019t help but wonder how you ever managed before. I absolutely hate taking the shower curtains off because of the whole open and close for several shower curtains. I know you\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s just shower curtain hooks.\u2019 And it is. But when you have to change out the creepy shower liner that likes to attack you, and you dread doing so, this just adds seconds to your life. No more unsnapping. Simply take out the liner, place the liner on the appropriate hook, and presto.\" \u2014 Nardsbaby Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in 18 colors). 10. A powerful massage gun with five speeds and massage heads \u2014 it\u2019s great for targeting various muscle groups, so you can use it on your back, shoulders, arms, legs, and pretty much anywhere that hurts. It delivers a deep massage that helps relieve the soreness and stiffness that you've been living with for far too long. www.amazon.com Read more about what massage guns can (and can\u2019t) do, plus how to use them, at Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: \"I have had chronic issues with pain caused by severely knotted muscles. This massager changed my life! I have tried muscle relaxers, stretching, and many other things, but a couple of muscles in my upper back would just knot up with any stress, physical or emotional, and the pain was nearly constant. I used this for about a half hour on all of my muscles with the first use, and the effects were immediate and profound. Pain relief was instant , and occasional use for a couple of minutes to the affected areas has been able to maintain that relief. I loved it so much that I bought one for my brother, who says it is helping him tremendously, as well. I have charged my massager twice in the last two months, battery life is excellent!\" \u2014 Patty S. Get it from Amazon for $89.99 (available in seven colors). 11. A Squatty Potty that elevates your feet to help mimic a natural squatting position for easier, more complete bowel movements. Just because it helps your trips to the bathroom be quicker doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still enjoy some quality TikTok scrolling time while you\u2019re in there! Amazon, www.amazon.com I have one and it has truly made that aspect of life (\ud83d\udebd) soooo much easier! The only downside is that public restrooms don't have these and I kind of can't go without it lol. Read more about constipation relief at home, including using a squatting position, at Cleveland Clinic . And if you want more Squatty Potty content before making this life-changing purchase, check out our Squatty Potty review ! Promising review: \"I'll do you all the courtesy of NOT adding a photo or video (You're welcome). This works. Whoever invented the toilet had their heart in the right place, but not their knees. This device mimics proper positioning, and you should get one. That is all. Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.\" \u2014 P.W. Get it from Amazon for $24.97 (available in three sizes; get the acrylic version for $79.99 or the teak wood version for $50.99 ). 12. And a before-you-go toilet spray \u2014 spritz the bowl before doing your business, and you'll be able to relax knowing whoever comes in next won't detect any funky smells. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I love the variety of scents that linger long enough to work for the purpose intended. I love giving them as gifts!!!\" \u2014 AML Get it from Amazon for $4.72+ (available in six sizes). 13. A pack of crew socks because your toe is literally poking through your current socks, like hello?? These are lightweight and breathable (perfect for a socks-and-sandals moment), and reviewers say they hold up well through repeated wash cycles \u2014 which is not something many other socks can claim! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"These socks are fantastic!

Promising review: \"I love these knives! I\u2019ve had them for a year now and I haven\u2019t had to sharpen them. Good grip, durable, and easy to handle. I hand wash them because we don\u2019t have a dishwasher but they\u2019re very easy to clean. I love the blade covers. It makes them safe for putting them in a drawer. I love not having a big knife block on my counter. Lightweight. They have not rusted.\" \u2014 Nvs Get the 12-piece set from Amazon for $18.99 (also available in a 10-piece set). 15. A spice drawer organizer so you can finally have the neatly arranged, easy-to-find collection of spices you've always wanted.

Amazon YouCopia is a woman-owned small biz that makes ingenious home and kitchen storage solutions. Promising review: \"This is one of my favorite things I've ever purchased from Amazon!

An oil stain remover that pulls out stains caused by oil, brake fluid, and other petroleum-based products from porous floor surfaces (like concrete, pavers, parking lots, etc). It's basically like skincare for your driveway! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"The scene: me with a hot glove carrying a drip pan full of au jus. Thumb goes into hot liquid. Pan is dropped, and greasy meat juice is all over our patio brick. In freezing temps. I use a putty knife to get some out, but there the stain remains six months later. Even muriatic acid didn\u2019t cut it. Ordered this. Tried a spot. Let it dry overnight. Swept it. Stain is almost gone. I apply it to the rest of the stain and let it set. But this time it rains and turns it gooey. Fortunately, new power washer and I join forces with Chomp, and within a half hour, it\u2019s totally gone. Amazing product. 1,000% satisfied. \" \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (available in two sizes). 17. A set of gold cable organizers you can stick to your desk or nightstand to hold those cords that are always falling to the ground or getting tangled. Unlike those bulky (and tbh ugly) organizers, these'll look like beautiful gold gems in your space. Brighttia / Etsy Brighttia is a New York-based Etsy shop established in 2018 that specializes in industrial and modern interior lighting and decor. Promising review: \"These brass cable organizers are beautiful and high quality. I\u2019m using two of them to keep a plug-in sconce cord attached to the wall and to direct the cord to the electrical outlet. These little gold pieces add a touch of functionality and glamour to the sconces. Exactly what I was looking for.\" \u2014 Amy Margolis Get a set of four from Brighttia on Etsy for $22.98 (available in 12 colors). 18. A dishwasher magnet so everyone in the house knows NOT to put their dirty spoon in with the freshly cleaned silverware. Sometimes it's too hard to tell whether the dishwasher needs to be run or unloaded, and this just clears up all the confusion. Sally Elshorafa / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"What took them so long?? Every household should have one of these. Does your partner point to the dishwasher and ask you, 'Hey, are these good?' Mine did, almost daily. Not anymore, though! A breeze to install (our dishwasher is magnetic, but I'm really glad it came with adhesive pads \u2014 someday when we move, if we need them we have them!), and even though I bought it (mostly) as a joke, I use the heck out of it. Slides easily when it needs to.\" \u2014 Andrea Braun Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in six styles). 19. A bestselling ChomChom pet hair remover if you want to see what your clothes, furniture, and other fabric surfaces look like *not* covered in fur. It's reusable and works its magic without using anything sticky (so no residue)! This gadget went super viral based on its results \u2014 and that's when you know a product is good. Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed See the ChomChom roller in action on TikTok ! BuzzFeed Shopping editor Jenae Sitzes swears by this: \"The tens of thousands of 5-star Amazon reviews are reason enough to add the ChomChom to your cart immediately \u2014 but let me add my own personal review to the stack. I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, and I took the photos above to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller \u2014 at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair. It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside , which does require you to apply a bit of pressure. Afterward, you'll just dump out the hair that's been trapped inside. The ChomChom is best for large flat surfaces like couches and beds.\" Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in three colors). 20. And a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator \u2014 I know you're busy, but you simply cannot sit any longer in a house that smells like cat urine.

That one spot behind the couch that your cat won't stop peeing on doesn't stand a chance. \ud83d\udcaa www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This product is amazing!!!! We have a Rottweiler pup and a bichon pup, and our house was feeling the PAIN! I tried everything and used to tell my wife, 'With all the science and technology in the world, we still can\u2019t come up with something that gets rid of the dog mark smell!' This product does everything and more. Just ordered another round. We were about to throw away some furniture due to the smell and now after use we can keep it. Saved me hundreds. Well worth the money. \" \u2014 clayton s tonkin Get it from Amazon for $17.96 (available in two sizes and packs of two or three). 21. A standing weeder that uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. It has a bamboo handle and four steel claws to really dig into those roots and pull them OUT. Your back deserves a break from playing tug of war with stubborn weeds. Amazon Grampa's Gardenware Co. is an Oregon-based, family-owned small business. Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 22. Some foaming garbage disposal cleaning packets to clean out all the gunk from your roommates who just don't understand the concept of throwing food in the garbage instead of down the sink. Just insert a packet into the disposal with hot water trickling to the side, then turn on the disposal and watch it fizz up \u2014 soon, those gag-worthy smells will be a thing of the past. Amazon Promising review: \"Saw on TikTok (don\u2019t judge) and automatically added to cart. So easy to use, takes probably a minute to fully bubble up and clean, and you\u2019re left with a clean sink!

And while you're at it, some dishwasher tablets that break down lime and mineral buildup to properly clean your dishwasher (you know, the machine that cleans your dishes ) without *any* effort on your part. Just pop in a tablet and run the dishwasher as normal \u2014 it sure beats having to climb in there yourself and scrub. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and dishes just not getting clean. Then, I became aware that the water softener was no longer doing its job so I had the rental company replace it. Dishwasher performance improved somewhat. I decided to do two more loads before deciding to purchase a new one. Then I saw a product test review for Affresh. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway so I added that to my order. When it came, I tossed one of the tablets into the bottom of the full machine per the instructions and ran the regular cycle. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I will use this faithfully every month, as recommended. \" \u2014 Sheila Get a pack of six tablets from Amazon for $7.49 . 24.

Been using them since high school! The amount of junk and buildup that comes off is so satisfying to see! It can be irritating when removing, especially if you have sensitive skin.

I tried this product on a whim\u2026and boy am I glad!! I wash, rinse and dry in the morning and they are dry and ready for use by lunch if I need a touch up. It does take a few minutes but SO WORTH it!! They more I use it, the faster I am getting. My brushes look new after and feel so much better on my skin. My makeup even goes on nicer.

I'm so glad I bought these little bra strap clip holders because they've solved the problem. I've used them for three days now, and my straps have not fallen off of my shoulders even once in that time. Amazing! I love them! I put a clip holder on my bra and then put the bra on like a T-shirt \u2014 over my head, put my arms in, then fasten it as usual in the back \u2014 pretty easy.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

You want to squeeze as much life from a laptop or desktop computer as possible. Doing so can save a substantial amount of money over time, and stops you from contributing to mountains of e-waste . At the same time, dealing with an old, sluggish computer is a frustrating experience. If apps and websites are taking ages to load, it can seriously impact your productivity. At a certain point, the temptation to upgrade to a shiny, speedy new computer proves irresistible. A middle ground exists, which is to make sure your laptop or desktop lasts as long as possible. There are multiple tricks you can try when it starts to show its age\u2014tricks that could mean it stays usable for much longer than you expected. Cut down on the clutter You\u2019ll find several programs starting up with Windows or macOS. Screenshot: Apple One way to stretch the life of your computer is to reduce its load. Uninstall any apps you\u2019re not actively using, and keep your apps trim in terms of extensions and add-ons. We\u2019ve covered how to uninstall programs on Windows and macOS , and it\u2019s not difficult to do. Limiting the number of programs starting up with your computer can help too: It means fewer apps running in the background, freeing up more memory and other system resources. You can take care of this with a few clicks on both Windows and macOS . The more storage space you have the better. It gives your computer and its operating system room to breathe and get organized, and can improve performance. Uninstalling apps should help with this, but also be on the lookout for files that you no longer need or can move somewhere else. Choose some upgrades Some well-chosen upgrades can breathe new life into an old computer. While this is going to cost you money, it won\u2019t cost as much as a full upgrade would\u2014and it could mean you get several years of extra use out of your device. The right upgrade will depend on your system\u2019s specs, how much you have to spend, how easy the system is to upgrade, and how comfortable you are with opening up your computer. This is mostly for Windows PCs and for desktops, though a few limited laptop upgrades are sometimes possible. Upgrading the RAM or the storage on your computer are usually the best upgrades for getting the most bang from your bucks. It could be something as straightforward as buying an external hard drive to move files over to, for example. Install another operating system There are plenty of lightweight Linux distros to choose from. Screenshot: Lubuntu In the interests of doing more with older components, you can install a fresh operating system to replace Windows or macOS, one that\u2019s less demanding on your aging computer. This will wipe everything on your system though, so be sure to back up all of your important files and folders first. Linux is always a popular and completely free option, and it comes in many different flavors (known as distros). Some of them, such as Lubuntu , are designed to be as lightweight as possible. Have a browse around the web and you\u2019ll find many options to pick from, as well as detailed guides to how to make the switch. Then there\u2019s ChromeOS Flex , which essentially turns your Windows or Mac computer into a Chromebook. You\u2019re just running a web browser with a few extras, so older computers should be up to the challenge. As with Linux, this is free to do, and it\u2019s perfect if you spend most of your computing time in a web browser anyway. Use your computer for something else Then there\u2019s the option of using your computer for something else , rather than an all-purpose machine. One option is using your aging laptop or desktop as a media server: It doesn\u2019t have to do anything except stream audio and video to other devices on your network. Plex and Emby are two programs that can help. Or how about turning your ancient computer into a dedicated writing machine? This could work if your machine is so old that it\u2019s no longer getting security updates, so shouldn\u2019t really be connected to the web. Set up a word processor and you\u2019re good to go (you will need a USB drive to get your writing shared elsewhere, however). Repurposing your laptop or desktop doesn\u2019t save you from the cost of an upgrade, because you\u2019ll still need to buy another computer, but it does cut down on e-waste and does mean your hardware stays useful for longer.

While the initial reciprocal tariffs will remain for imports, U.S. Customs and Border Protection shared some new exemptions on tech-related goods. The update was announced yesterday evening and follows various tariff increases, particularly on Chinese imports. The exemptions include many products we're excited to see get some relief. The complete list is available in the official bulletin, but it includes computers, smartphones, semiconductor chips, and other tech goods like flat panel TVs, solar cells, and flash drives. The most recent tariff increase from Trump was 145% on Chinese goods. This sent waves across the tech industry, as many realized the significant impact it would have on many tech products that we rely on, including laptops, desktops, CPUs, semiconductor chips, and any PC component. Large companies like Apple, HP, Dell , and more preemptively imported extra stock before the tariff announcement to skirt some of the impact.

This should offset the price increases for customers and manufacturers who rely on imports for construction materials. The United States imports around 66% of its tech goods from China, which caused significant concern when tariffs were first announced and subsequently raised on Chinese imports. We recently reported expectations that consoles, monitors, and laptops would be among the most impacted. Many tariffs initially imposed on April 5th will be reduced for 90 days, but tariffs on China have continued to increase . This exemption list is the first we've seen concerning the tariff situation with China. That said, tariffs will remain in place for all other imports not included in the exemption list. The situation is subject to change, but we'll report any significant updates on the tariff situation as things progress, so be sure to check back regularly for more information.

Reply Are you sure that it includes PC components , not just fully-assembled PCs? Also, I expect cases, heatsinks, and radiators are still be affected by the 25% steel & aluminum tariffs, which did not get suspended. Lastly, the \"de minimis\" exemption on small (sub-$800) packages ends May 2nd. That will hit anything shipped directly from abroad (AliExpress, Temu, some sellers on Amazon & ebay, etc.). I'm not sure exactly how that's going to work, but I think you'll be assessed a customs fee that you pay in order to pick up or receive your package. But, it's the recipient who pays. So, don't expect it to be incorporated into sellers' prices. Reply \"The complete list is available in the official bulletin\" No it's not.

Sure it is, but you have to look up what all those headings/sub correspond to here: https://hts.usitc.gov/ Reply sadly, the only groups that will benefit from these exemptions will be the big businesses. they wont reduce their prices, theyll simply pocket the price difference, while consumers continue to pay inflated prices Reply This tariff exemption move is good for consumers and big tech companies, but it also severely undermines the whole point of the tariffs . I'm completely confused on what the objective and strategy is now. I also get the impression that the big tech executives have too much influence when they can create special exemptions for their businesses. Reply thestryker said: https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=8542 So, what's that column labelled \"2\", which says 35% ? Reply bigdragon said: This tariff exemption move is good for consumers and big tech companies, but it also severely undermines the whole point of the tariffs . Yeah, I can imagine more and more exemptions getting created, as that 145% rate on Chinese imports begins to bite and retailers & consumers start to recoil at the prices of things. As for tech products, recall that the same thing happened last time around. There was initial panic about motherboards & graphics cards getting hit, but then they were exempted for a time period that kept getting extended. bigdragon said: I'm completely confused on what the objective and strategy is now. I think the objective hasn't really changed. The strategy is what's now in doubt. bigdragon said: I also get the impression that the big tech executives have too much influence when they can create special exemptions for their businesses. Well, yes but I'm sure their case played well, with AI being seen as a strategic priority. Also, it's not just tech executives...

Jay L Clendenin/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Jay L Clendenin/Getty Images The Trump administration has amended its list of imports that will be affected by sweeping global tariffs in order to exempt certain electronics, including smartphones and computers. Politics China put steep tariffs on U.S. exports. Farmers are worried The updated guidance was published Friday night by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The exemption will apply to President Trump's steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" imposed across dozens of countries, which have since been paused until early July as well as the 145% levies currently in place on China. That was the only country excluded from the reciprocal tariff pause. The exemption is effective for products that entered the U.S. or left warehouses starting on April 5. The White House issued a presidential memo about the exemption on Saturday. Sponsor Message When asked about the reasoning behind the exemption, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.\" Leavitt added, \"At the direction of the President,\" companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \"are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\" The electronics exemption is a major development in the tariff war with China, which has imposed a 125% tariff on U.S. goods . Prices for electronics from China, a key sector, had been expected to spike . Politics Where do tariffs stand? A look at what's in place and what's on pause Among the items that will now be spared from Trump's steep tariffs include smartphones, computers, semiconductors, and flat panel display modules. But the updated guidance did not address any changes to the existing 20% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China's involvement in the fentanyl trade. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission , China has long been America's chief source for electronic products, with Mexico, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaysia rounding out the top five. There was also concern for American tech giants that rely on supply chains in China, like Apple. Before the updated guidance, Apple was expected to experience major setbacks as a result of the tariffs, Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC earlier this week.
