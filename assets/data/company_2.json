Reuters reports that the company, which makes phone cases, power banks, adapters, cables, and more, raised prices on a fifth of its products since Thursday. The move comes as the company passes the cost of US tariffs onto its US-based customers. Some 127 Anker products have seen an average increase of 18% since Thursday last week, with the majority of those occurring after Monday, April 7, when U.S. President Donald Trump added an extra 50% import duty on Chinese goods, according to data from e-commerce services provider SmartScout. Reuters notes that, on an investor call earlier in the week, Anker had said that it was able to raise prices \u201cas it had bargaining power and because its rivals were mainly Chinese and under similar tariff pressure, but did not provide specifics.\u201d Ultimately, more companies could well choose to follow suit. Tariffs make it more costly for companies to bring goods from specific countries into the United States. One way that those companies can negate the additional costs while protecting their profits is to increase prices, effectively passing the cost of the tariffs onto customers. The result is that US-based customers pay more for products as a result of the tariffs that were imposed by its leaders.

Fortinet warns that threat actors can retain read-only access to FortiGate devices even after the original vulnerability used for the breach has been patched. The cybersecurity firm revealed that attackers exploited known FortiGate flaws like CVE-2022-42475 , CVE-2023-27997 , and CVE-2024-21762 to gain persistent read-only access via a symlink in SSL-VPN language folders. \u201cA threat actor used a known vulnerability to implement read-only access to vulnerable FortiGate devices. This was achieved via creating a symbolic link connecting the user filesystem and the root filesystem in a folder used to serve language files for the SSL-VPN. This modification took place in the user filesystem and avoided detection.\u201d reads the advisory published by Fortinet. \u201cTherefore, even if the customer device was updated with FortiOS versions that addressed the original vulnerabilities, this symbolic link may have been left behind, allowing the threat actor to maintain read-only access to files on the device\u2019s file system, which may include configurations.\u201d Fortinet pointed out that only devices with SSL-VPN enabled are impacted. The company added that scans show the attacks weren\u2019t limited to any specific region or industry. Fortinet mitigated the attack by deploying AV/IPS signatures, updating releases to block the symbolic link, and urging customers to patch devices while maintaining transparency. The company did not link the attacks to a certain threat actor, however, the investigation is still ongoing. Below are the FortiOS mitigations released by the company: FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: The SSL-VPN UI has been modified to prevent the serving of such malicious symbolic links. FortiOS 7.4, 7.2, 7.0, 6.4: The symbolic link was flagged as malicious by the AV/IPS engine so that it would be automatically removed if the engine was licensed and enabled. FortiOS 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17, 6.4.16: Upgrading to this release will remove the malicious symbolic link. The cybersecurity vendor notified impacted customers and provided the following mitigations: Treat all configuration as potentially compromised and follow the recommended steps below to recover: Upgrade all devices to 7.6.2, 7.4.7, 7.2.11 & 7.0.17 or 6.4.16.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

While President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he would delay many of the market-shaking tariffs that he\u2019d announced the previous week, he kept a universal baseline 10% tariff in place, while also increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to 125% (on top of a 20% tariff that he\u2019d already imposed on goods from China). There\u2019s been plenty of speculation about what the tariffs will mean for the tech industry , which manufactures many consumer electronics in China and elsewhere abroad. One of Trump\u2019s stated goals is to bring manufacturing back to the United States, but others believe the dream of an American-made iPhone is a fantasy . Those debates may be paused after Friday evening, when U.S. Customs and Border Protection posted a list of product categories that are \u201cexcluded from the reciprocal tariffs imposed under Executive Order 14257,\u201d with the exclusions backdated to April 5. Those categories appear to include smartphones, laptops, hard drives, and semiconductors. Those products will all be exempt from both the 125% tariff on goods from China, as well as the universal baseline tariff. (Other tariffs, such as the previous 20% tariff on Chinese goods, would presumably still apply.) Notable Silicon Valley figures led by Elon Musk have joined the Trump administration, while other tech CEOs have been courting Trump, most visibly with millions of dollars donated to his inauguration. Those efforts seemed to bear little fruit \u2014 until last night\u2019s announcement, which Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, described as \u201ca dream scenario for tech investors.\u201d Tech giants like Apple and Nvidia are likely celebrating the news, as are U.S. consumers who will avoid a big markup on their next iPhone. But the industry could still be hit with more targeted tariffs and other restrictions. For example, The New York Times reports that the Trump administration is preparing a national security-related investigation into semiconductors. And indeed, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday that these products would be included in \u201cthe semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two.\u201d This post has been updated with Howard Lutnick\u2019s comments about the tariffs.

Mythic Quest, the Apple TV Plus comedy about a game studio, isn\u2019t getting a fifth season, reports Variety . And, like a developer issuing a farewell patch, Apple is updating the final episode of season four with a new \u201cgoodbye\u201d ending next week. Variety published a statement from Mythic Quest \u2019s executive producers: \u201cEndings are hard. But after four incredible seasons, \u2018Mythic Quest\u2019 is coming to a close,\u201d said series executive producers Megan Ganz, David Hornsby, and Rob McElhenney. \u201cWe\u2019re so proud of the show and the world we got to build\u2014and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it. To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning. Because endings are hard, with Apple\u2019s blessing we made one final update to our last episode\u2014so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.\u201d The news comes just weeks after a report that Apple has been losing $1 billion a year on TV Plus. The show just wrapped up its fourth season and released a f our-episode spinoff called Side Quest on March 26th. One of the early Apple TV Plus shows, Mythic Quest tells the story of Mythic Quest Studios, a fictional games studio led by Ian Grimm, Rob McElhenney\u2019s parody of a visionary tech founder bro, and Charlotte Nicdao\u2019s Poppy Li, an awkward but brilliant engineer who serves as his co-creative director. Throughout the series, Mythic Quest sent up the tech industry, from lampooning startup culture to raising some of the gaming world\u2019s darker ethical questions . But to echo an early Verge write-up of Mythic Quest , you don\u2019t need to understand any of that to enjoy the show.

See Full Bio MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle (MSNBC screenshot) MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle appeared with her old hosting partner Ali Velshi on Saturday morning to weigh in on a major announcement from Donald Trump's administration on Chinese imports. In a bulletin posted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection late Friday, the administration announced smartphones, computers, and assorted electronics would be exempt from the ruinous 145% percent tariffs imposed on other Chinese products. As Ruhle, a former hedge fund trader put it, \"This is huge.\" Speaking with Velshi, she elaborated, \"So just imagine all the big electronics that we get that's manufactured in China , right? Chips, semiconductors, TVs, cell phones \u2013\u2013 all the big electronics out there are now going to be tariff-free. I mean, Ali, this is extraordinary.\" \"It's kind of like saying we're going to impose 100 plus percent tariffs on everything we buy from China, except for what we actually buy from them,\" she dryly quipped. \"It's sort of crazy because we haven't even started negotiating, you know, this trade war and already we're making this announcement.\" \"It's mind-blowing i n that in the last week what have we done,\" she added. \"The president announced the moves on tariff, we saw the stock market crater, we saw the bond market get whacked, which is the most concerning because it means people don't have faith in the U.S.\". \"We saw consumer confidence absolutely crater and businesses big and small fall into an absolute panic, given what an enormous trading partner China is, but also countries around the world, but focusing just on china, man, if you are [ Apple head] Tim Cook or the other big tech CEO's who gave big and went to Trump's inauguration, you are glad you did that,\" she observed.

A flexible drain snake that'll get out all those clumps of hair and gunk so the bathtub stops filling up past your ankles every time you shower. Just stick it down the drain, twist it, and the ridges at the end will catch all the goop, making sure it all comes out. Amazon, www.amazon.com This pack contains a reusable handle and five single-use heads that you just remove and dispose of after handling your clogged pipes. Promising review: \"Wow. Best thing ever. Seriously. I have had tweezers and sticks and plumbers and chemicals trying to get my master sink to drain. Plumber even said I need an entirely new faucet to get the drain plug part because they don't sell those separately. Well, I have two sinks, a tub, and shower that all match so that was not a valid solution. Doubt I can find the same model. So I bought this thing, stuffed it down, and pulled up hair and black muck. Did it about eight times quickly, ran the water, went right down the drain. Seriously. This is the best tool ever and the best $20 I have ever spent. Everyone with a sink needs this tool. Seriously.\" \u2014 juliejules Get a five-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in other sets and styles). 2. A pack of 120 retainer cleaner tablets because it turns out your Invisalign is supposed to be ~clear~ (it also works on mouthguards and dentures!). All you do is drop a tablet into warm tap water, let your dental device soak for a few minutes, and voila! \u2014 it'll kill bacteria and remove the buildup that's causing discoloration and unpleasant odors. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I really loved this product. I am currently waiting for a new Invisalign set. My old Invisalign needed to be cleaned. I read the reviews and decided to purchase. OMG, it worked! They had a fresh taste and were clean. I wish I had found this product sooner. I did let them soak overnight only because I had been wearing them for the last four months. Nothing happened to Invisalign; there was no weakness or anything. Just very clean and fresh. If I could have given the product 10 stars, I would have. \" \u2014 Lisa R. Get 120 tablets from Amazon for $18.81 (available in five pack sizes). 3. A new pair of workout leggings to replace the super pilled ones you wear three times a week. They're made with a thick, buttery soft fabric (no one is seeing those hot pink undies) and have ~pockets~ so you don't have to carry your phone around the gym. www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"THESE...are the best leggings I have ever worn in my entire life! They are so smooth and comfortable. Soft as butter. They fit perfectly. It almost feels like you're naked but they feel somehow insulated and cozy. Stretchy and made of amazingly durable quality. I need to get more colors!\" \u2014 Alexandra Shick Get them from Amazon for $24.98 (available in women's sizes XS\u2013XXL, in three inseam lengths, and 45 colors). 4. A pack of AirPods cleaning putty because it's so embarrassing when you want to share earbuds with someone, but yours are coated in wax and dust. Plus, it's soooo satisfying to squish the lil' square into your speaker and see all the gunk it pulls out \u2014 and then you get to enjoy clearer, louder-sounding music! www.amazon.com Before you toss your tech in the trash, at least give this a try. Promising review: \"I never usually write reviews but this is an exception. I've had my AirPods for over a year and when the sound quality was diminishing, I was afraid they had a short life expectancy and I would need to get a new pair! Even after using cotton buds to clean the AirPods out, I thought that was enough until my friend said there's stuff built up and hard to see, but there was nothing able to get it out! Enter this product. It literally took five minutes to clean each ear bud effectively and instantly the sound quality was as good as new! Loud, clear, less trouble connecting to my phone, etc. You don't need a full square to clean them, so you can pull a piece off or reuse a square with a side you haven't used! SO happy I found a solution!\" \u2014 Amazon Customer Get 24 squares from Amazon for $15.99 (available in two pack sizes). 5. A veggie chopper for keeping your counter tidy while speeding up your prep time. If you love to cook but hate chopping (who doesn\u2019t, right?), this thing is a lifesaver. It chops just about everything \u2014 onions, peppers, zucchinis, potatoes, you name it! Plus, it comes with different blades for slicing, dicing, and even spiraling your favorite veggies. www.amazon.com , Amazon Check out a TikTok of the veggie chopper in action. Promising review: \"If you cook, you need this product! I have had this chopper since 2018 and it is by far my favorite kitchen purchase. I have used it hundreds of times over the years and it has held up great. I just bought my MIL one for Christmas and she already loves how much easier it has made meal prep . It is well made and I like that there are different attachments and sizes. I would recommend this chopper!\" \u2014 Steph Get it from Amazon for $23.99+ (available in five colors and five sets). 6. A pack of two antimicrobial \"flossing toothbrushes\" because your current one looks like it was used to scrub the bathroom floor (no offense). This has dual-layered bristles: regular ones and ultra-long, thin flossing bristles that get *deep* in between your teeth and gums. Reviewers are saying it feels like they got their teeth cleaned at the dentist, but nope! \u2014 just this very innovative toothbrush. Emma Lord / BuzzFeed Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, specializing in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed for deeper cleans. Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord has to say: \"I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively.\" Promising review: \"I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth \u2014 it definitely gets between the teeth and also, more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck, and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!\" \u2014 Jason A. Get a pair from Amazon for $9.99 . 7. A WD-40 pen if your squeaky cabinets are driving you up the wall. It's way less messy than traditional spray methods, and reviewers love the precision this pen offers \u2014 perfect for getting into tight spaces and silencing those squeaks once and for all. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I love WD-40 products and use them for everything. I spray on shovels to keep dirt or snow from sticking, spray around windows and thresholds to deter bugs, clean Sharpies off wood and walls, and, of course, stop squeaky doors. These small direct-point application pens are great. Keep one in the glove box, my kitchen 'junk' drawer, and the house toolbox.\" \u2014 BBP623 Get a three-pack from Amazon for $12.99 . 8. A wall-mounted organizer to handle those annoying brooms, mops, rakes, and shovels that are always falling over. This rack has five slots and can hold up to 38 pounds, so it\u2019ll keep everything neatly stored and off the floor. www.amazon.com It comes with screws, anchors, a drilling template, and a guide \u2014 everything you'll need to set this up. Promising review: \"Perfect! Exactly what I needed to organize my mop, broom, scoop, etc. Efficient and easy to use. A little hard to get my scoop into it, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s thicker than the rest of the items. Love that there are hooks. Spray bottles and cleaning product bottles hang perfectly on there too.\" \u2014 Kavita Chandanie Get it from Amazon for $13.99 (available in two sizes and two colors). 9. A set of double-sided shower rings that make changing your shower curtain or liner easier than it's ever been. Since you hang the curtain on one side and the liner on the other, you'll avoid the hassle of taking the whole thing down every time you switch the curtain/liner. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This is one of those items you didn\u2019t know you needed, and once you get it, you can\u2019t help but wonder how you ever managed before. I absolutely hate taking the shower curtains off because of the whole open and close for several shower curtains. I know you\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s just shower curtain hooks.\u2019 And it is. But when you have to change out the creepy shower liner that likes to attack you, and you dread doing so, this just adds seconds to your life. No more unsnapping. Simply take out the liner, place the liner on the appropriate hook, and presto.\" \u2014 Nardsbaby Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in 18 colors). 10. A powerful massage gun with five speeds and massage heads \u2014 it\u2019s great for targeting various muscle groups, so you can use it on your back, shoulders, arms, legs, and pretty much anywhere that hurts.

Promising review: \"I have had chronic issues with pain caused by severely knotted muscles. This massager changed my life! I have tried muscle relaxers, stretching, and many other things, but a couple of muscles in my upper back would just knot up with any stress, physical or emotional, and the pain was nearly constant. I used this for about a half hour on all of my muscles with the first use, and the effects were immediate and profound. Pain relief was instant , and occasional use for a couple of minutes to the affected areas has been able to maintain that relief. I loved it so much that I bought one for my brother, who says it is helping him tremendously, as well. I have charged my massager twice in the last two months, battery life is excellent!\" \u2014 Patty S. Get it from Amazon for $89.99 (available in seven colors). 11. A Squatty Potty that elevates your feet to help mimic a natural squatting position for easier, more complete bowel movements. Just because it helps your trips to the bathroom be quicker doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t still enjoy some quality TikTok scrolling time while you\u2019re in there! Amazon, www.amazon.com I have one and it has truly made that aspect of life (\ud83d\udebd) soooo much easier! The only downside is that public restrooms don't have these and I kind of can't go without it lol. Read more about constipation relief at home, including using a squatting position, at Cleveland Clinic . And if you want more Squatty Potty content before making this life-changing purchase, check out our Squatty Potty review ! Promising review: \"I'll do you all the courtesy of NOT adding a photo or video (You're welcome). This works. Whoever invented the toilet had their heart in the right place, but not their knees. This device mimics proper positioning, and you should get one. That is all. Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.\" \u2014 P.W. Get it from Amazon for $24.97 (available in three sizes; get the acrylic version for $79.99 or the teak wood version for $50.99 ). 12. And a before-you-go toilet spray \u2014 spritz the bowl before doing your business, and you'll be able to relax knowing whoever comes in next won't detect any funky smells. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"I love the variety of scents that linger long enough to work for the purpose intended. I love giving them as gifts!!!\" \u2014 AML Get it from Amazon for $4.72+ (available in six sizes). 13. A pack of crew socks because your toe is literally poking through your current socks, like hello??

Promising review: \"I love these knives! I\u2019ve had them for a year now and I haven\u2019t had to sharpen them. Good grip, durable, and easy to handle. I hand wash them because we don\u2019t have a dishwasher but they\u2019re very easy to clean. I love the blade covers. It makes them safe for putting them in a drawer. I love not having a big knife block on my counter. Lightweight. They have not rusted.\" \u2014 Nvs Get the 12-piece set from Amazon for $18.99 (also available in a 10-piece set). 15. A spice drawer organizer so you can finally have the neatly arranged, easy-to-find collection of spices you've always wanted.

Amazon YouCopia is a woman-owned small biz that makes ingenious home and kitchen storage solutions. Promising review: \"This is one of my favorite things I've ever purchased from Amazon!

An oil stain remover that pulls out stains caused by oil, brake fluid, and other petroleum-based products from porous floor surfaces (like concrete, pavers, parking lots, etc). It's basically like skincare for your driveway! www.amazon.com Promising review: \"The scene: me with a hot glove carrying a drip pan full of au jus. Thumb goes into hot liquid. Pan is dropped, and greasy meat juice is all over our patio brick. In freezing temps. I use a putty knife to get some out, but there the stain remains six months later. Even muriatic acid didn\u2019t cut it. Ordered this. Tried a spot. Let it dry overnight. Swept it. Stain is almost gone. I apply it to the rest of the stain and let it set. But this time it rains and turns it gooey. Fortunately, new power washer and I join forces with Chomp, and within a half hour, it\u2019s totally gone. Amazing product. 1,000% satisfied. \" \u2014 Teddy Roosevelt Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (available in two sizes). 17. A set of gold cable organizers you can stick to your desk or nightstand to hold those cords that are always falling to the ground or getting tangled. Unlike those bulky (and tbh ugly) organizers, these'll look like beautiful gold gems in your space. Brighttia / Etsy Brighttia is a New York-based Etsy shop established in 2018 that specializes in industrial and modern interior lighting and decor. Promising review: \"These brass cable organizers are beautiful and high quality. I\u2019m using two of them to keep a plug-in sconce cord attached to the wall and to direct the cord to the electrical outlet. These little gold pieces add a touch of functionality and glamour to the sconces. Exactly what I was looking for.\" \u2014 Amy Margolis Get a set of four from Brighttia on Etsy for $22.98 (available in 12 colors). 18. A dishwasher magnet so everyone in the house knows NOT to put their dirty spoon in with the freshly cleaned silverware. Sometimes it's too hard to tell whether the dishwasher needs to be run or unloaded, and this just clears up all the confusion. Sally Elshorafa / BuzzFeed, www.amazon.com Promising review: \"What took them so long?? Every household should have one of these. Does your partner point to the dishwasher and ask you, 'Hey, are these good?' Mine did, almost daily. Not anymore, though! A breeze to install (our dishwasher is magnetic, but I'm really glad it came with adhesive pads \u2014 someday when we move, if we need them we have them!), and even though I bought it (mostly) as a joke, I use the heck out of it. Slides easily when it needs to.\" \u2014 Andrea Braun Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in six styles). 19. A bestselling ChomChom pet hair remover if you want to see what your clothes, furniture, and other fabric surfaces look like *not* covered in fur. It's reusable and works its magic without using anything sticky (so no residue)! This gadget went super viral based on its results \u2014 and that's when you know a product is good. Jenae Sitzes / BuzzFeed See the ChomChom roller in action on TikTok ! BuzzFeed Shopping editor Jenae Sitzes swears by this: \"The tens of thousands of 5-star Amazon reviews are reason enough to add the ChomChom to your cart immediately \u2014 but let me add my own personal review to the stack. I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, and I took the photos above to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller \u2014 at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair. It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside , which does require you to apply a bit of pressure. Afterward, you'll just dump out the hair that's been trapped inside. The ChomChom is best for large flat surfaces like couches and beds.\" Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in three colors). 20. And a bottle of Angry Orange pet odor eliminator \u2014 I know you're busy, but you simply cannot sit any longer in a house that smells like cat urine. This breaks down stains and odors at their source, leaving your home smelling fresh and citrusy without using harsh ingredients. That one spot behind the couch that your cat won't stop peeing on doesn't stand a chance. \ud83d\udcaa www.amazon.com , www.amazon.com Promising review: \"This product is amazing!!!! We have a Rottweiler pup and a bichon pup, and our house was feeling the PAIN! I tried everything and used to tell my wife, 'With all the science and technology in the world, we still can\u2019t come up with something that gets rid of the dog mark smell!' This product does everything and more. Just ordered another round. We were about to throw away some furniture due to the smell and now after use we can keep it. Saved me hundreds. Well worth the money. \" \u2014 clayton s tonkin Get it from Amazon for $17.96 (available in two sizes and packs of two or three). 21. A standing weeder that uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. It has a bamboo handle and four steel claws to really dig into those roots and pull them OUT. Your back deserves a break from playing tug of war with stubborn weeds. Amazon Grampa's Gardenware Co. is an Oregon-based, family-owned small business. Promising review: \"Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled.\" \u2014 JG Get it on Amazon for $39.99 . 22. Some foaming garbage disposal cleaning packets to clean out all the gunk from your roommates who just don't understand the concept of throwing food in the garbage instead of down the sink.

And while you're at it, some dishwasher tablets that break down lime and mineral buildup to properly clean your dishwasher (you know, the machine that cleans your dishes ) without *any* effort on your part. Just pop in a tablet and run the dishwasher as normal \u2014 it sure beats having to climb in there yourself and scrub. www.amazon.com Promising review: \"After using this product, I am happy to report that my $5 investment saved me over $500. I was ready to replace my dishwasher due to super cloudy glasses, residue, and dishes just not getting clean. Then, I became aware that the water softener was no longer doing its job so I had the rental company replace it. Dishwasher performance improved somewhat. I decided to do two more loads before deciding to purchase a new one. Then I saw a product test review for Affresh. I was ordering some stuff from Amazon anyway so I added that to my order. When it came, I tossed one of the tablets into the bottom of the full machine per the instructions and ran the regular cycle. I did not expect the results I got! The glassware that I thought was permanently etched and ruined came out like new. Same with cutlery. The difference is unbelievable. I will use this faithfully every month, as recommended. \" \u2014 Sheila Get a pack of six tablets from Amazon for $7.49 . 24.

(AP Photo/Hau Dinh) FILE - The iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max are displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store, Friday, Sept. 16, 2022, in New York. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) The Trump administration late Friday said it would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs , a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren\u2019t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, setting the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. Recommended Videos U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won\u2019t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere . It's the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been making a lot of money,\u201d he said. \"It\u2019s been the other way around. Other countries, in particular China was making a lot of money.\u201d It is not clear how long the exemption will last or if separate tariffs will be negotiated on the various products. The exemption filed Friday night seemed to reflect the president\u2019s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration\u2019s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What\u2019s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump\u2019s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the combined Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It\u2019s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech\u2019s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump\u2019s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off \u201ca huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. In a statement issued Saturday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the exemptions specifically but indicated the administration still plans to push for tech companies to move manufacturing to the U.S. \u201cPresident Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops,\" Leavitt said in an emailed statement. She said the administration has secured U.S. investments from tech companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia and these companies are \"hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\u201d Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ Liedtke contributed from Berkeley, California. AP White House correspondent Darlene Superville in West Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.

You want to squeeze as much life from a laptop or desktop computer as possible. Doing so can save a substantial amount of money over time, and stops you from contributing to mountains of e-waste . At the same time, dealing with an old, sluggish computer is a frustrating experience. If apps and websites are taking ages to load, it can seriously impact your productivity. At a certain point, the temptation to upgrade to a shiny, speedy new computer proves irresistible. A middle ground exists, which is to make sure your laptop or desktop lasts as long as possible. There are multiple tricks you can try when it starts to show its age\u2014tricks that could mean it stays usable for much longer than you expected. Cut down on the clutter You\u2019ll find several programs starting up with Windows or macOS. Screenshot: Apple One way to stretch the life of your computer is to reduce its load. Uninstall any apps you\u2019re not actively using, and keep your apps trim in terms of extensions and add-ons. We\u2019ve covered how to uninstall programs on Windows and macOS , and it\u2019s not difficult to do. Limiting the number of programs starting up with your computer can help too: It means fewer apps running in the background, freeing up more memory and other system resources. You can take care of this with a few clicks on both Windows and macOS . The more storage space you have the better. It gives your computer and its operating system room to breathe and get organized, and can improve performance. Uninstalling apps should help with this, but also be on the lookout for files that you no longer need or can move somewhere else. Choose some upgrades Some well-chosen upgrades can breathe new life into an old computer. While this is going to cost you money, it won\u2019t cost as much as a full upgrade would\u2014and it could mean you get several years of extra use out of your device. The right upgrade will depend on your system\u2019s specs, how much you have to spend, how easy the system is to upgrade, and how comfortable you are with opening up your computer. This is mostly for Windows PCs and for desktops, though a few limited laptop upgrades are sometimes possible. Upgrading the RAM or the storage on your computer are usually the best upgrades for getting the most bang from your bucks. It could be something as straightforward as buying an external hard drive to move files over to, for example. Install another operating system There are plenty of lightweight Linux distros to choose from. Screenshot: Lubuntu In the interests of doing more with older components, you can install a fresh operating system to replace Windows or macOS, one that\u2019s less demanding on your aging computer. This will wipe everything on your system though, so be sure to back up all of your important files and folders first. Linux is always a popular and completely free option, and it comes in many different flavors (known as distros). Some of them, such as Lubuntu , are designed to be as lightweight as possible. Have a browse around the web and you\u2019ll find many options to pick from, as well as detailed guides to how to make the switch. Then there\u2019s ChromeOS Flex , which essentially turns your Windows or Mac computer into a Chromebook. You\u2019re just running a web browser with a few extras, so older computers should be up to the challenge. As with Linux, this is free to do, and it\u2019s perfect if you spend most of your computing time in a web browser anyway. Use your computer for something else Then there\u2019s the option of using your computer for something else , rather than an all-purpose machine. One option is using your aging laptop or desktop as a media server: It doesn\u2019t have to do anything except stream audio and video to other devices on your network. Plex and Emby are two programs that can help. Or how about turning your ancient computer into a dedicated writing machine? This could work if your machine is so old that it\u2019s no longer getting security updates, so shouldn\u2019t really be connected to the web. Set up a word processor and you\u2019re good to go (you will need a USB drive to get your writing shared elsewhere, however). Repurposing your laptop or desktop doesn\u2019t save you from the cost of an upgrade, because you\u2019ll still need to buy another computer, but it does cut down on e-waste and does mean your hardware stays useful for longer. And when you do finally need to get rid of a computer, make sure you do it responsibly .

While the initial reciprocal tariffs will remain for imports, U.S. Customs and Border Protection shared some new exemptions on tech-related goods. The update was announced yesterday evening and follows various tariff increases, particularly on Chinese imports. The exemptions include many products we're excited to see get some relief. The complete list is available in the official bulletin, but it includes computers, smartphones, semiconductor chips, and other tech goods like flat panel TVs, solar cells, and flash drives. The most recent tariff increase from Trump was 145% on Chinese goods. This sent waves across the tech industry, as many realized the significant impact it would have on many tech products that we rely on, including laptops, desktops, CPUs, semiconductor chips, and any PC component. Large companies like Apple, HP, Dell , and more preemptively imported extra stock before the tariff announcement to skirt some of the impact. You may like Tech enthusiasts brace for Trump tariff price hikes on new components Nvidia may avoid recent tariffs on its AI servers \u2014 60% of Nvidia servers pass through Mexico, may be exempt from Trump tariff flurry These exemptions should benefit industry leaders and consumers alike, who have been anticipating serious price hikes on imported products. This should offset the price increases for customers and manufacturers who rely on imports for construction materials. The United States imports around 66% of its tech goods from China, which caused significant concern when tariffs were first announced and subsequently raised on Chinese imports. We recently reported expectations that consoles, monitors, and laptops would be among the most impacted. Many tariffs initially imposed on April 5th will be reduced for 90 days, but tariffs on China have continued to increase . This exemption list is the first we've seen concerning the tariff situation with China. That said, tariffs will remain in place for all other imports not included in the exemption list.

Reply Are you sure that it includes PC components , not just fully-assembled PCs? Also, I expect cases, heatsinks, and radiators are still be affected by the 25% steel & aluminum tariffs, which did not get suspended. Lastly, the \"de minimis\" exemption on small (sub-$800) packages ends May 2nd. That will hit anything shipped directly from abroad (AliExpress, Temu, some sellers on Amazon & ebay, etc.). I'm not sure exactly how that's going to work, but I think you'll be assessed a customs fee that you pay in order to pick up or receive your package. But, it's the recipient who pays. So, don't expect it to be incorporated into sellers' prices. Reply \"The complete list is available in the official bulletin\" No it's not.

Reply bigdragon said: This tariff exemption move is good for consumers and big tech companies, but it also severely undermines the whole point of the tariffs . Yeah, I can imagine more and more exemptions getting created, as that 145% rate on Chinese imports begins to bite and retailers & consumers start to recoil at the prices of things. As for tech products, recall that the same thing happened last time around. There was initial panic about motherboards & graphics cards getting hit, but then they were exempted for a time period that kept getting extended. bigdragon said: I'm completely confused on what the objective and strategy is now. I think the objective hasn't really changed. The strategy is what's now in doubt. bigdragon said: I also get the impression that the big tech executives have too much influence when they can create special exemptions for their businesses. Well, yes but I'm sure their case played well, with AI being seen as a strategic priority. Also, it's not just tech executives...

Jay L Clendenin/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Jay L Clendenin/Getty Images The Trump administration has amended its list of imports that will be affected by sweeping global tariffs in order to exempt certain electronics, including smartphones and computers. Politics China put steep tariffs on U.S. exports. Farmers are worried The updated guidance was published Friday night by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The exemption will apply to President Trump's steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" imposed across dozens of countries, which have since been paused until early July as well as the 145% levies currently in place on China. That was the only country excluded from the reciprocal tariff pause. The exemption is effective for products that entered the U.S. or left warehouses starting on April 5. The White House issued a presidential memo about the exemption on Saturday. Sponsor Message When asked about the reasoning behind the exemption, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones, and laptops.\" Leavitt added, \"At the direction of the President,\" companies including Apple, TSMC and Nvidia \"are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\" The electronics exemption is a major development in the tariff war with China, which has imposed a 125% tariff on U.S. goods . Prices for electronics from China, a key sector, had been expected to spike . Politics Where do tariffs stand? A look at what's in place and what's on pause Among the items that will now be spared from Trump's steep tariffs include smartphones, computers, semiconductors, and flat panel display modules. But the updated guidance did not address any changes to the existing 20% tariff on Chinese goods in response to China's involvement in the fentanyl trade. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission , China has long been America's chief source for electronic products, with Mexico, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Malaysia rounding out the top five. There was also concern for American tech giants that rely on supply chains in China, like Apple. Before the updated guidance, Apple was expected to experience major setbacks as a result of the tariffs, Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC earlier this week.

NYC helicopter that plunged into Hudson River had mechanical issue months before fatal wreck ny post ^ Posted on 04/12/2025 9:56:21 AM PDT by BenLurkin The ill-fated Bell206L-4 LongRanger IV aircraft, owned and operated by New York Helicopter, experienced a mechanical issue with its transmission assembly last September, according to Federal Aviation Administration data. Records show the doomed chopper was built in 2004 and had already logged 12,728 hours of flight time when it was forced into repair. An investigation is underway to determine what caused the aircraft to drop out of the sky and plunge into the river. The probe will comb through the pilot\u2019s experience, the still-incomplete wreckage, and the Big Apple company that runs the sightseeing tours. Investigators will also review the maintenance work that was done on the doomed aircraft, including the completion of two recent safety airworthiness directives the FAA issued on Bell 206L model helicopters. The federal agency issued the first directive in December 2022 and called for the inspection and possible replacement of the models\u2019 main rotor blades due to \u201cdelamination\u201d \u2014 an issue with the internal layers of the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage or other defects. The problem, if not fixed, could potentially cause the rotor blade to fail. A second directive, issued in May 2023, required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor shafts on eight models, including the one involved in Thursday\u2019s deadly wreck, according to the FAA, which issued the alert after a chopper lost a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failur (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies ] To: BenLurkin Analysis of the video of the crash shows the rotor and transmission separated from the helicopter. The rotor/transmission was autorotating so the Jesus nut isn't really a suspect nor is mast bump. The most likely failure was a sudden and violent jam in the transmission that took it from normal rotation speed to zero in a very short amount of time. That would cause huge counter torque that likely stressed the tail rotor/boom assembly to the failure point. Also break away of the the transmission/rotor assembly from the fuselage indicates shearing from both mounting points on top of the cabin. Blancolerio has a very detailed explanation of this scenario too. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8Q8XuqlyMQ&t=323s 13 posted on 04/12/2025 10:29:10 AM PDT by pfflier [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies ] To: BenLurkin The \u201cJesus Nut\u201d fell off, it\u2019s the main nut that holds the top rotary wing on.

But \u201cshort\u201d isn\u2019t all that short. A Helio-Courier can take off in 350 feet, and a Pilatus Porter in 650, and those are exceptional cases (for any airplane that can carry a significant load).

The Electronics Companies Reacted Swiftly To The Threat of Trump\u2019s Tariffs There is no word on what pushed Trump to make this decision, but it follows the swift response from numerous electronics companies to his blanket tariffs.

OnePlus also raised the price of its latest smartwatch without sharing a reason for the decision, but it wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to assume it was related to Trump\u2019s blatant abuse of tariffs.

Down from \u00a31,199 ($1,530) by 8% or, you guessed it, \u00a3101, the new price is \u00a31,098 ($1,401) and you can choose between black, pink, teal, ultramarine and white. If you can\u2019t resist the three cameras and titanium frame of the iPhone 16 Pro, these are discounted, too. Here\u2019s the link. All four colors are available for the 128GB storage models. That means Desert Titanium, Black Titanium, Natural Titanium and White Titanium are all 10% off, that means the regular \u00a3999 ($1,308) price is knocked down by \u00a3100 ($131) to \u00a3899 ($1,178). And you\u2019ll notice the magic spell of \u00a3101 off has been broken on this model, though only just. Forbes Apple\u2019s Stealthy New Music Upgrade For Windows PCs Beats Microsoft By David Phelan Same for the 256GB model, which also sees \u00a3100 ($131) off, across the board. Here it\u2019s a 9% discount, taking the \u00a31,099 ($1,439) sticker down to \u00a3999 ($1,308). All four colors available. Step up to 512GB storage and something eerily predictable happens: all four colors available with \u00a3100 ($131) off. This means an 8% price cut, so the regular \u00a31,299 ($1,701) price drops to \u00a31,199 ($1,570). The same \u00a3100 ($131) cut means the regular \u00a31,499 ($1,963) price for the 1TB storage option is \u00a31,399 ($1,832). The biggest phone of all is the iPhone 16 Pro Max with a 6.9-inch display. Check this link and you\u2019ll see a wholly unsurprising discount in place. That\u2019s right, there\u2019s \u00a3100 ($131) off the 256GB model \u2014 the lowest-capacity storage option for the Max \u2014 which reduces the price from \u00a31,199 ($1,570) to \u00a31,099 ($1,439), with all colors ready to ship. The 512GB version also (can you believe it?) shows a \u00a3100 ($131) price cut. That\u2019s a 7% discount and brings the regular \u00a31,399 ($1,832) sticker to \u00a31,299 ($1,701. All colors available. The 1TB option, regularly \u00a31,599 ($2,094) down by \u00a3100 ($131), as you may have guessed. This 6% price cut means you\u2019ll pay \u00a31,499 ($1,963). Lastly, there\u2019s the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. Last year\u2019s standard iPhones may not have all the love expended on the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, which arguably took the regular phones closer to the Pro models than before, but they\u2019re still worth considering, especially when the prices are reduced as here. Apple will sell you the iPhone 15 with 128GB storage for \u00a3699. On Amazon ( here\u2019s the link ), all five colors are available for \u00a3598. That\u2019s 14% off and our old friend the $101 discount reappears. The five colors, by the way, are yellow, green, pink, blue and black. Trade up to 256GB and instead of the regular \u00a3799 price you can find all five for \u00a3698. The larger-display iPhone 15 Plus, usually selling for \u00a3799 with 128GB storage, has dropped to \u00a3698, that\u2019s 13% off but only in green and pink. The 256GB storage has dropped from \u00a3899 to, yes, that\u2019s right, \u00a3798, which is an 11% discount. You can choose between blue and black for this deal. The 512GB storage option is available for this larger phone, wih the same \u00a3101 discount, taking the price from \u00a31,099 to \u00a3998. Choose between black and, no, that\u2019s it, just black. Incidentally, if U.S. readers see the price translations and feel the Brits are paying well over the odds compared to prices in the States, remember that U.S. prices are quoted pre-tax and U.K. ones have all sales taxes included, so the disparity isn\u2019t as steep as it looks. And if price rises cut in Stateside because of tariffs, then iPhones could even be cheaper on the other side of the pond one day.

All manner of electronic devices have been exempted, including computer components such as GPUs from Nvidia, semiconductors and the equipment used to make them, SSDs, displays, many TVs, and more. Some other electronic devices including video game consoles like the Nintendo Switch 2 are still subject to the tariffs. As Bloomberg points out, the exemptions could be temporary and the Trump administration could be planning for new, lower tariffs on electronics and other goods from China. The order also does not exempt companies from the 20 percent \"fentanyl\" fee imposed on China, which was an earlier penalty, so there is still a fee that Apple will need to pay. With the back and forth over tariffs and the 90-day pause Trump put in place in some countries, Apple stock has been volatile for the last week and has dropped more than 20 percent before recovering somewhat. As of market close yesterday, Apple's stock was down 11 percent from early April. Update : This article previously stated that AirPods and HomePod were not covered by the exemptions, but it appears they in fact are.

A notice late Friday by the US Customs and Border Protection office said smartphones, computers and other electronics would be excluded from the import levies President Donald Trump rolled out a week ago. The move came as retaliatory Chinese import tariffs of 125 percent on US goods took effect Saturday, with Beijing standing defiant against its primary trade competitor. The exemptions will benefit US tech giants like Apple that make iPhones and other premium products in China, and will generally narrow the impact of the staggering 145 percent tariffs Trump has imposed this year on Chinese goods entering the United States. Washington and Beijing's escalating tariff battle has raised fears of an enduring trade war between the world's two largest economies and sent global markets into a tailspin. The fallout has sent particular shockwaves through the US economy, with investors dumping government bonds and the dollar tumbling. Nevertheless, Trump insisted Friday on his Truth Social platform that \"we are doing really well on our tariff policy,\" even after Beijing announced its latest hike. Daniel Ives, senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, called the US exemptions \"the best news possible for tech investors.\" \"US tariff exclusions will apply to computers, smartphones, and chip-making equipment which takes (away) a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector,\" he added in a note. Without these exemptions, he said, \"the US Tech industry would be taken back a decade and the AI Revolution thesis would have been slowed significantly.\" Many of the exempted products, including hard drives and computer processors, generally are not made in America. While Trump has referred to tariffs as a way to bring manufacturing back to the United States, analysts say it will likely take years to ramp up domestic production. Trump has specifically targeted China with his \"reciprocal\" tariffs meant to address practices Washington deems unfair. And even with Washington and Beijing going toe-to-toe, the White House insists Trump remains \"optimistic\" about a deal with China. His Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping gave his first major comments on the tensions Friday, with state media quoting him as saying his country was \"not afraid.\" Economists warn that the disruption in trade between the tightly integrated US and Chinese economies will increase prices for consumers and could spark a global recession. China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao told the head of the World Trade Organization (WTO) that US tariffs will \"inflict serious harm\" on poor nations, according to a ministry statement released Saturday. \"The United States has continuously introduced tariff measures, bringing enormous uncertainty and instability to the world, causing chaos both internationally and domestically within the US,\" Wang told WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala in a call, the statement said. Beijing also indicated Friday that it would ignore any further levies by Trump because it said it no longer makes economic sense for importers to buy from America. China also said it would file a lawsuit with the WTO over the latest round of levies. Meanwhile, Taiwan's government on Saturday said it held first tariff discussions with the United States and expected more talks to build \"strong and stable\" trade ties. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te on Friday said the island was on \"the first negotiating list of the US government\" as he looks to shield its exporters from a 32-percent tariff. \u00a9 Copyright AFP 2024.

Santiago/Getty Images By Naveen Athrappully 4/12/2025 Updated: 4/12/2025 Print X 1 0:00 President Donald Trump exempted a range of everyday products, specifically in the electronic category, from reciprocal tariffs while importing into the United States. Items excluded from reciprocal tariffs include smartphones, computers, servers, laptops, tablets, motherboards, processors, memory modules, machines used for manufacturing semiconductor devices, integrated circuits, flat panel displays, and related devices, according to updated guidance from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection published on April 11. The items will be exempt from tariffs imposed on countries by Trump, and the 145 percent tariff imposed on China, which is the major manufacturer and supplier for all these components. The tariff relief will be a boost for tech companies like Apple, whose shares had fallen since Trump announced the implementation of tariffs on April 2. Apple\u2019s stock price declined nearly 23 percent as it fell from $223.89 on April 2 to $172.42 on April 8. The company\u2019s market capitalization loss amounted to almost $640 billion. It has since recovered partially, trading at $198.15 at the time of publication. Other items included in the announcement are routers, modems, network switches, SSD storage devices, USB drives, SD cards, display modules like LCD, OLED, computer monitors, certain transistors, solar cells, LEDs, microchips, microprocessors, memory chips, and more. Related Stories Beijing Attempting to Offset Tariffs With Yuan Devaluation, Say Analysts 4/12/2025 China Hikes Tariffs on US Goods to 125 Percent 4/11/2025 Trump announced reciprocal tariffs in retaliation for trade barriers levied by countries importing U.S. goods. A baseline global tariff of 10 percent was enforced along with country-specific customized tariffs based on their trade stances towards the United States. Upon announcing the tariffs, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned countries not to retaliate. China refused to comply, and hit back with tariffs of its own against the United States, starting a trade war, which has now culminated in a 145 percent tariff on the Asian manufacturing hub. China has again hit the United States with a 125 percent tariff. Meanwhile, Trump has paused tariffs for all other countries in order to negotiate better trade deals for the United States. Trump\u2019s tariffs have also triggered volatility in U.S. and global markets, impacting bonds and treasury yields. Beijing is trying to counteract the adverse impacts of the trade tariffs via a depreciation of the Chinese yuan, analysts told The Epoch Times. On April 8, China\u2019s central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, set the yuan\u2019s central parity rate at 7.2038, marking the first time since September 2023 that the rate has surpassed the 7.20 threshold. As of April 11, the exchange rate is approximately 7.291 yuan per USD. The forced depreciation of yuan is one of the reasons why Trump imposed harsher penalties on the regime, along with stealing IP, dumping products in foreign markets, and maintaining a large trade imbalance with the United States.

With Trump\u2019s pro-bitcoin pivot, a new wave of startups is surging into the space, buoyed by regulatory optimism and moves like the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. From privacy-preserving cloud startups to Lightning-powered payment rails, the Commons is where conviction meets code \u2014 and careers are risked in pursuit of a new kind of financial system. watch now VIDEO 5:56 05:56 Former Apple and Cash App engineers flock to Austin as Trump embraces bitcoin Crypto World AUSTIN \u2014 On a Friday morning last spring, Mark Suman called out sick from his job as a senior engineering project manager at Apple and made his way downtown to a place called the Bitcoin Commons, a sort of clubhouse for enthusiasts of the world's largest cryptocurrency, situated a few blocks south of the Texas State Capitol. At the time, Suman was, in his words, \"an active hobbyist,\" tinkering with the technology in his spare time. \"I actually played around with it a bit within Apple as well,\" he says. \"There's not a lot I can say, other than we were always exploring new technologies, and so I was playing around with some of the open-source bitcoin tools within Apple and doing some exploratory work.\" Suman was there for the annual 'Bitcoin Takeover' event. He had followed many of the speakers online and when he saw the gathering pop up on his feed, he took the day off to see it for himself. \"I was sitting in the crowd wanting to get into the space and really build something new and build something novel,\" Suman recalled. What happened instead was the beginning of a professional pivot: he struck up a conversation with a developer after a talk at the Commons, and was introduced to other coders who were winding down a project called Mutiny. Within a few months, Suman handed in his notice at Apple and with the developers he'd met, pivoted into something bigger \u2014 co-founding Open Secret, a startup reimagining how user data is stored in the cloud. Instead of relying on centralized databases, the company encrypts data to each individual user \u2014 even after it\u2019s uploaded. So if there's a breach, there's nothing to steal, Suman explained. No honeypot. Parker Lewis speaks at the Bitcoin Commons, where he helps lead educational efforts around bitcoin adoption and policy. Rod Roudi/Bitcoin Commons The leap was not without stakes. \"There are plenty of sleepless nights,\" he said. \"I've got a family, I've got kids, I've got a kid off at university.\" He had spent years working on privacy infrastructure \u2014 tackling tough technical problems around user protection at scale \u2014 but saw a way to do it better with blockchain. \"Apple likes to talk a big game about privacy,\" he says. \"And having been there, I've seen very deep within a lot of their systems that they do care about privacy at every level.\" That vision \u2014 and the Commons \u2014 helped give him conviction. The builders there were all laser focused on creating something that mattered. Inside Austin's bitcoin clubhouse Bitcoin Commons sits on the second floor of the Littlefield Building at the corner of Congress Avenue and Sixth Street \u2014 where the broad boulevard to the Capitol collides with the noisy sprawl of Austin\u2019s nightlife district. It\u2019s an apt metaphor for the space itself. By day, it serves as a clean, open-plan coworking hub for bitcoin operators and builders. At night, it transforms into a gathering place for rogue developers and off-the-record meetups. Events here draw a blend of venture capitalists, open-source contributors, off-grid energy technicians, and Lightning engineers \u2014 developers who build software to make bitcoin faster and cheaper to use. On some afternoons, once happy hour hits, the kitchen in the back converts into a bar. \" Bitcoin is the most important technological innovation in any of our lifetimes, and it needs its due,\" said Parker Lewis, one of the stewards of the Commons and the author of a new book on bitcoin called \"Gradually, Then Suddenly.\" \"And so while bitcoin has no CEO and no marketing team, we here at the Bitcoin Commons and Bitcoiners all over the world help educate people about bitcoin, why it's important, what's being built, and present a vision for the future,\" continued Lewis. \"The vibe, it's always high signal,\" said Dan Lawrence, CEO of OBM, which manages energy use for industrial-scale mining farms. Lawrence said he was \"thankful\" that the U.S. government had become a little more pro-bitcoin under the new administration, but added, \"No matter what happens anywhere, everybody here is always going to bleed bitcoin.\" The \"Bitcoin Commons\" functions as a sort of clubhouse for the city's bitcoin believers. It puts on a mix of programming, including conferences and hackathons, as well as hosts a co-working space by day. CNBC This year, the Commons feels different \u2014 not because bitcoiners have changed, but because the world around them has. The mood is bullish. Strategic. Triumphant, even. Bitcoin 's price mirrored this optimism, surging to an all-time high of nearly $110,000 in January, coinciding with Trump's inauguration. By early April, it had retraced to the low $70,000s before rebounding to nearly $85,000 as of Saturday morning \u2014 volatility that underscores the market's sensitivity to political developments and investor sentiment. Just a year ago, the vibe in the Commons was cautious. Even bitcoin \u2014 the asset largely spared by securities law \u2014 felt the chill of an aggressive regulatory regime. Developers were being arrested around the world. Wallet providers were being pressured. Open-source projects landed on sanctions lists. The question then was, who would be next? Then came the election. Trump\u2019s return to the White House brought with it a full-court press of pro-bitcoin policy moves . Within his first 100 days, he\u2019d pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht and three co-founders of the BitMEX crypto exchange , established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , and appointed a \"crypto czar\" to oversee the federal government\u2019s digital asset efforts. Even skeptics found themselves nodding. \"I was in Nashville when Trump spoke,\" Suman recalled of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Tennessee, where Trump made his first major address to the crypto industry. \"I wasn't planning on going. But you know, when someone like that is in town, you go see it.\" Suman says he feels Trump has delivered on his promises to the crypto community for the most part. Still, he remains cautious. \"I am not one who embraces politicians,\" Suman said. \"I'm kind of apolitical as far as which side. So I only trust them until I see how it's actually playing out in our life. So far, I think it's going well, but it could really change.\" Austin's \"Bitcoin Commons\" draws in an eclectic mix of people, including venture capitalists, bitcoin miners, and coders. CNBC Kevin Hurley, CTO at Lightspark, says Washington's stance toward crypto appears to be shifting, with regulators like the SEC taking a less combative approach \u2014 moving away from lawsuits and toward clearer capital markets rules . \"Hopefully now we're actually going to have some clarity on what is and what isn't a security, what can actually be done,\" he said. But even in a friendlier political climate, caution over government involvement remains a feature, not a bug, of the crypto community. Joe Kelly, CEO of Unchained \u2014 a startup that helps clients store bitcoin securely by holding their own private keys \u2014 said it's smart to be careful what you wish for when it comes to the U.S. government owning a lot of bitcoin. \"That can go other ways,\" he said. To date, the government's so-called Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has underwhelmed some digital asset advocates, since it's limited to bitcoin previously seized in enforcement actions \u2014 not newly purchased assets or sovereign investment. Still, the administration has directed the Treasury and Commerce Departments to explore budget-neutral ways to acquire more bitcoin. Kelly acknowledges a shift in the regulatory atmosphere, but he's also wary of premature celebration, even with big market wins like the launch of exchange-traded funds that allow investors widespread access to bitcoin. \"If something like the ETF had launched too soon, I think it could have distracted from the people building on the actual technology itself,\" Kelly said. \"We've had the fortune that for most of Unchained's life there wasn't an ETF,\" he added of the firm's efforts to educate investors on how to store their crypto. Becca Rubenfeld of Anchor Watch explains how federal shifts could allow bitcoin to be treated as an admitted asset by insurers \u2014 a potential breakthrough for institutional adoption. Rod Roudi/Bitcoin Commons The shift has had ripple effects across the industry, including insurance. Becca Rubenfeld, COO of Anchor Watch, says regulatory movement is opening the door for bitcoin to be treated like any other financial asset. Traditional insurers don't cover bitcoin directly \u2014 they insure the infrastructure around it. But if bitcoin becomes an admitted asset on insurance company balance sheets, that changes everything. \" Currently, the industry is extremely underserved,\" Rubenfeld told CNBC. \"But what Anchor Watch is doing is specifically insuring the asset itself. So we built a proprietary custody solution. And when customers use us for custody services, Lloyd's of London backed insurance is included in those services.\" The demand is growing. So is the pressure to build \u2014 and secure \u2014 the technical infrastructure that makes bitcoin work. Mike Schmidt of Brink discusses the critical need to support open-source developers who maintain bitcoin's core infrastructure. Rod Roudi/Bitcoin Commons Mike Schmidt, executive director of Brink, which funds open-source bitcoin developers through a nonprofit structure, emphasized the importance of supporting the engineers maintaining bitcoin's underlying infrastructure. \"Bitcoin needs engineers,\" he said. \"We have a $2 trillion asset. We have strategic reserves of bitcoin being held by countries, and there's just this small group of engineers that are keeping this thing together at the code base,\" Schmidt said. \"There's only maybe 40 full-time engineers working on this. So we want to make sure that the engineering growth can keep pace with its broader adoption.\" Lisa Neigut started as a back-end engineer at Cash App, where she worked on their internal bitcoin product, before moving to Blockstream and spending six years as an open-source developer on the Lightning Network. These days, she runs Bitcoin++, one of the largest technical conference series in the space, with six events planned across six countries this year. \"Bitcoin++ is focused on bringing together bitcoin developers and builders to talk about what they're working on \u2014 the frontier of bitcoin,\" Neigut said. \"You can get an idea of what bitcoin is going to look like tomorrow.\" That sense of momentum resonates with filmmaker Alana Mediavilla, who spent five years at Google working on films about big data and cloud infrastructure. She screened her new documentary, Dirty Coin, a feature-length project looking at bitcoin\u2019s energy footprint and the people behind the infrastructure, at the Commons. Power supply for Whinstone's bitcoin mine in Rockdale, Texas. \"I had put in my time in the cloud space,\" she says. \"I understood what data centers were, I understood where it was going, and I also understood how much energy it takes to run these huge facilities that right now are running the backbone of our society.\" Her goal wasn't to necessarily defend bitcoin mining but to broaden the conversation. \"I just want to get everybody's data center literacy up to a certain point where we can continue to have conversations about it, because it's not going away.\" She describes the crowd in Austin as a coming together of people \"very committed to their craft\" \u2014 and in her view, driven more by shared ideals than by profit-seeking. \"People think that it's like a get-rich-quick,\" she said. \"Maybe those were the old days for bitcoin. Now, if you want 100x you should look at altcoins and meme coins and other stuff, but you're probably not going to get that with bitcoin.\" \"What brings them together is that they want to have better money, and they want to have a more fair world,\" she added. \"So the principles are solid. How we implement those principles \u2014 that's where the variety and spice of life comes in.\" Big money meets big ideas A surge of new funding is also reshaping bitcoin's builder economy. Venture investment in bitcoin-related startups soared in 2024 alongside the crypto market's rally. The number of pre-seed deals in the space climbed 50% last year, according to research from Trammell Venture Partners, an Austin-based VC firm focused on bitcoin-native startups. Across all early-stage funding rounds, nearly $1.2 billion has been invested in bitcoin companies since 2021. The renewed interest comes after years of technical upgrades to the bitcoin protocol and growing confidence in its long-term resilience. \"Serious people no longer question whether bitcoin will remain 15 or 20 years into the future,\" said Christopher Calicott, managing director at Trammell. \"So the next question becomes: Is it possible to build what the founder is trying to achieve on bitcoin? Increasingly, the answer is yes.\" PitchBook projects that crypto venture funding will surpass $18 billion in 2025 \u2014 nearly doubling the annual average from the previous two-year cycle. Much of that capital is flowing into bitcoin infrastructure and applications \u2014 payments, privacy tools, custody solutions \u2014 rather than the speculative trading platforms of previous cycles.

Futurum CEO names 3 he's bullish on for 2024 Bernstein tech analyst's best idea for 2024 is to short Tesla Morgan Stanley picks 'alpha' opportunities in China tech - giving one 52% upside Turning ideals \u2014 and venture dollars \u2014 into reality still requires real-world infrastructure. And that's where entrepreneurs like Steve Barbour, the founder of Canadian firm Upstream Data, come in. He's spent years building off-grid mining containers for remote oilfields, but this spring, he's expanding operations into Wyoming, a bet he attributes directly to the Trump administration's rollback of energy regulations and renewed push for domestic production. Wyoming \u2014 home to both sprawling coal operations and some of the country's most permissive crypto laws \u2014 has emerged as a hub for bitcoin miners and the lawmakers who support them. The administration's latest executive orders loosen environmental restrictions and encourage more fossil fuel development \u2014 a boon for oilfield miners like Barbour, even as critics warn it could come at a steep climate cost. \"I'm extremely optimistic and bullish on Trump's administration,\" Barbour said. \"The EPA finally came out with a new stance on all these things they've been doing to just destroy the energy sector in America, which has affected us very negatively. I'm seeing a lot of things going the right way now with the decisions the Trump administration is making, and clearly they're trying to attract investment in America and manufacturing.\" Zaprite's Parker Lewis shares policy insights at the Commons, calling for federal legislation like the proposed Bitcoin Act to cement regulatory clarity. Rod Roudi/Bitcoin Commons Zaprite's Lewis, one of the Commons' most vocal policy thinkers, agrees that things are moving in the right direction \u2014 particularly around the government's decision to establish a formal national bitcoin reserve. While a crypto executive order is an important first step, \"codifying it with law will help drive further regulatory clarity that the U.S. is open for bitcoin,\" Lewis said. \"It will also be good for the country ... the biggest priority would be for the regulatory clarity piece, pushing Sen. Lummis' Bitcoin Act to codify and make permanent. \" Senator Lummis, a longtime advocate for the industry, is pushing legislation to codify bitcoin protections into federal law. Her proposed legislation outlines a plan for the U.S. to buy bitcoin with \"existing funds\" of the Treasury Department, which includes tax revenue. The idea, in part, is to position bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset \u2014 one that could appreciate over time and reduce reliance on debt. The senator has said that the ultimate goal is to reduce the federal deficit, as well as position bitcoin alongside gold and other hard assets as a way to strengthen the dollar over time. Without the Bitcoin Act becoming law, Lewis warns that today\u2019s tailwinds could reverse with a single administration change. But while Washington debates bitcoin's role in the future of the U.S. economy, Suman was already betting his own on it. \"Why did I leave this really cushy job at Apple, where I was getting paid a lot and had stock and that kind of stuff, to come here, where my future is uncertain?\" he said. \"It's the possibility of building something new that I think is really needed in the world. And I hope that it pans out. ... If it doesn't, and we go down in a glory of fire, at least I will have tried something that I really believe in.\" Even after he accepted the offer to join Mutiny \u2014 later pivoting into Open Secret \u2014 things didn't calm down. \"That was right when a prominent group of developers were arrested,\" he recalled. \"They were developing an app called Samurai, and they got arrested. I had accepted my offer with Mutiny, but I had not yet left Apple.\" The gamble wasn't just career-based. It was emotional. Existential. \"Knowing that people were being arrested and there was a lot of uncertainty, I still dove in,\" he said. \"The guys said, 'Listen, if you're worried, we can just call this off and you can stay at Apple,'\" Suman recalled. \"But I said, 'No, I really believe in what we're building. Let's make this thing scale.'\" watch now VIDEO 5:31 05:31 Inside Austin's bitcoin underground Crypto World watch now watch now VIDEO 12:17 President Trump signs bill rolling back controversial Biden-era crypto tax rule: CNBC Crypto World Tanaya Macheel watch now watch now VIDEO 05:56 Former Apple and Cash App engineers flock to Austin as Trump embraces bitcoin MacKenzie Sigalos watch now watch now VIDEO 12:01 Kraken's Thomas Perfumo discusses bitcoin's shifting narrative Tanaya Macheel Read More", "sentiment": "POSITIVE", "sentiment_score": 0.7, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/12/apple-google-cash-app-alums-ditch-big-tech-to-build-on-bitcoin.html", "source": "CNBC", "published_at": "2025-04-12T16:22:23"}, {"id": 38, "title": "Trump administration says some electronics will be excluded from reciprocal tariffs", "content": "Trump administration says some electronics will be excluded from reciprocal tariffs | PBS News", "sentiment": "NEUTRAL", "sentiment_score": 0.0, "url": "https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-administration-says-some-electronics-will-be-excluded-from-reciprocal-tariffs", "source": "PBS", "published_at": "2025-04-12T16:21:29"}, {"id": 39, "title": "Olivia Munn Picks Black Pointed-Toe Shoes for New York Press Day", "content": "Olivia Munn Picks Black Pointed-Toe Pumps for 'Your Friends' Press Read Next: Teyana Taylor Laces Up Vans x Satoshi Nakamoto Pearlized Sneakers at Coachella\u2019s Neon Carnival Subscribe Search Icon Close Open Menu Close Search Icon Open Search Search for: Search Icon Search for: Close Menu Follow Us Facebook Instagram LinkedIn Pinterest X YouTube Daily Newsletters Email address to subscribe to newsletter.
